<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>service is an innovative <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>service that can bring many benefits to both service users and libraries. Thanks to collaborations among libraries that share their staff, technology and other resources, no longer are library patrons confined to the services and resources of their local libraries. Patrons now have the opportunity to ask questions of institutions in remote locations for specialized information that would not otherwise be available to them. In many collaborative services such as <a href="http://www.247ref.org/aboutus.htm" target="_blank">24/7 Reference</a>, patrons can access the service without being restricted by time and location. Thus, library patrons could <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>help for their information needs via the help of participating libraries in a <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>consortium even when their local libraries are closed. </p>

  
  <p>From the library management <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> libraries can deploy staff more efficiently by participating in a bigger pool and embrace otherwise more costly virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>services. Be0es cost <span>reduction</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> a member library of a consortium could answer difficult subject-based research questions more <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>by referring the questions to subject specialists in other libraries in the consortium.   However, it seems that a large proportion of questions asked in a collaborative service are simply <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>back to the home libraries because they should   be resolved at a local level (<a href="#Coffman">Coffman 2002</a>; <a href="#Helfer">Helfer 2003</a>). Unfortunately, there is little monitoring of further transactions to ensure whether   the patrons received satisfying answers. </p>

<p>Unmonitored referrals, originally defined by Dewdney and Ross (<a href="#DewdneyRoss">1994</a>), <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>where the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>staff gives the patron a call number or <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the patron to a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in the library thought to contain the answer but does not follow up or check to make sure that the <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>is not only found but <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>answers the question. These unmonitored referrals seem to be <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>observed in a collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>setting when 'out0e' library staff refer the patrons back to local libraries. If a large proportion of those referrals are made back to the local libraries, however, that would not be an effective allocation of resources. </p>

<p>More importantly, the referrals, if unattended, can <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>frustrate the users of collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>services. While <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>questions are often answered by <i>out0e</i> library staff, many patrons would still view the service as a <i>local</i> service. Whenever the questions <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>local resources and services to answer adequately, library staff have to refer patrons back to their local libraries to complete the answer. Would the patrons still feel satisfied with a delayed answer? In fact, patrons' frustration caused by being transferred from one point to another in the midst of referrals is not unfamiliar. This frustration is equivalent to our everyday experience from using automated customer services on the phone or asking directions on the street.</p>

<p>Although some studies have <span>attempted</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to identify the types of questions that are effectively answered in virtual <span>reference</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> few have examined the types of questions that are more prone to referrals, or user satisfaction with referrals in the context of collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> Perhaps this is because <i>referral</i> are felt to be legitimate answers, although the notion has yet to be validated.  Dewdney and Ross (<a href="#DewdneyRoss">1994</a>) pointed out the problem of a high proportion of unmonitored referrals (42%) at the physical <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>service desk. They maintained that <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>staff tend to make unmonitored referrals as a way of circumventing the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>interview. Because few studies have examined the unmonitored referrals in collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>service settings, the present study investigates the extent of referrals and user satisfaction with referrals in these types of services. Specifically, the current study focuses on the following three questions:</p>

<p>Research Question 1: To what extent are questions answered as referrals and to what extent are questions answered completely during collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>sessions?</p>
<p>Research Question 2: Are certain types of questions <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>more <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>than others? If so, what types of questions are they? </p>
<p>Research Question 3: Are there any differences in user satisfaction levels betweentransactions answered with referrals and transactions answered with completed answers? </p>

<p> The <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of the study will inform us about the question types that are <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span><span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in the collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>service. The results will also inform of the extent to which referrals are made in collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and the efficacy of the referrals as an acceptable answer category from the users' <span>perspective</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> It will also help local libraries <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>their services for optimal question traffic management in the collaborative service. </p>

<h2>Literature review</h2>

<h3>Collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>services</h3>

<p>Virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>services have become a critical component in current <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>practice where the intent of libraries is to provide a fully functioning user service in the digital library <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> The rapid <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in the service has been made through both local and national efforts (<a href="#Kresh">Kresh 2002</a>). Some critics question the cost-effectiveness of virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>services because of low usage and high cost (<a href="#Coffman">Coffman 2002</a>; <a href="#CoffmanArret">Coffman &amp; Arret 2004</a>). Based on a cost-benefit analysis, Coffman and Arret <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the costs associated with <span>software</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> training and staffing are 'a pretty expensive way to answer a question' and may not justify continuing the service.</p>

  
  <p>Others argue that virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>is a niche service that will merge into a part of <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>services just as happened to telephone <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>services in the 1930s (<a href="#Kern">Kern 2004</a>). In particular, responding to the negative view toward virtual references, many <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>joining a consortium as a way for those libraries that cannot afford a stand-alone virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>service (<a href="#Bailey">Bailey-Hainer 2005</a>; <a href="#Kresh">Kresh 2002</a>; <a href="#Tenopir">Tenopir 2004</a>). Examples of collaborative models include an international library <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>project, the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/rr/digiref/" target="_blank">Collaborative Digital Reference Service</a> (CDRS), the <a href="http://cpl.org/clevnet-library-consortium.asp" target="_blank">CLEVNET Library Consortium</a> of Ohio public libraries, and <a href="http://www.askcolorado.org/" target="_blank">AskColorado</a>. Because of many benefits that collaborative service brings to both library management and user services, it is estimated that approximately seventy-six collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>services were in operation through the active participation of libraries of various types and sizes as of November 2004 (<a href="#Sloan">Sloan 2004</a>).</p> 


<h3>Referrals in collaborative virtual references</h3>

<p>Reference staff seem to make referrals for their patrons for various reasons. The cases can be <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>roughly into two types: expert research and re-directional local referrals. Expert research referrals relate to the situations when the questions are <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to subject specialists who could answer with their high level of expertise and resources. Difficult research questions would <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>into this type. The referrals in the other type, re-directional local referrals, relate to the situations when the answers <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>specific local knowledge or locally-restricted databases. Questions that would <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>into this type include questions about local library events that may or may not be listed on the library's Website or patrons' requests to check overdue fines. Despite both being referral, each type of referral could have con0erably different implications for <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>service delivery. The former type of referral enables member libraries to coordinate human expertise and resources in order to answer the questions that are otherwise unanswerable. In this case, patrons are linked to richer resources and subject specialists. </p>
  
  <p>In contrast, re-directional local referrals can be ineffective or even result in a disservice to the patrons. That is, patrons who access the inter-institutional collaborative <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>may not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>understand the seamless nature of the service that goes beyond the walls of their local library. It is possible that people who access this service through their library portal would ask simple, circulation-related questions (e.g., overdue status), anticipating an immediate answer. However, many times, these questions cannot be completed by <i>out0e</i> staff who do not have authority to access patron records. In this case, the patron should be <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>back to her or his local library to get the final answer. If a high proportion of the questions submitted to collaborative services are <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to a local library for this latter reason, it becomes an ineffective deployment of resources for the local library. Having this <span>concern</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> some libraries may decide to remain local for their virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>service, understanding that a high proportion of their <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>questions relate to their library resources and services (<a href="#KibbeeWardMa">Kibbee <i>et al.</i> 2002</a>).</p>
  

<p>In the current literature, there are not many <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>studies that have examined the proportion of referrals in <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>services. Among the few, Ross and Nilsen (<a href="#RossNilsen">2000</a>), in their unobtrusive <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>service evaluation study, reported that 37% of the total <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>transactions were unmonitored referrals. This <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>is based on 261 <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>transactions that occurred at physical <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>desks in both public and academic library settings. </p>

<p>As libraries adopt collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>services, librarians tend to expect more research related referrals because collaboration and communication among institutions have become much easier and seamless in the online <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> Interestingly, a rather reverse <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>was reported in a recent study by Nilsen (<a href="#Nilsen">2004</a>) who compared the unmonitored referrals between physical and virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>settings. While more than <span>one-third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of the transactions have unmonitored referrals in the physical <span>setting</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> the proportion was somewhat lower in the virtual <span>setting</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> comprising 28% of a total of 40 transactions. In her updated study with more transactions, unmonitored referrals were reported as 38% of a total of 85 virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>transactions where chat <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>comprised 25 transactions (<a href="#Nilsen2005">Nilsen 2005</a>). Since this small sample-size research appears to be the only one that <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>referrals in virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>setting, referrals in collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>are still largely <span>unknown</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>Referrals by query type</h3>

<p>Are there any specific types of questions that result in more referrals than others in the collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>setting? In other words, would referrals be contingent on the types of questions? Indeed, most factual and subject-based research questions are <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to be answered during the session by most participating librarians, especially when the consortium is equipped with a shared online catalogue and consortia-shared databases. Among these questions, complex subject-based <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>questions would be more likely to be <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to subject experts within the consortium. However, this type of question was reported to be very infrequent among the transactions. For example, Lee (<a href="#Lee">2004</a>) reported that research level questions comprised only 3% of all transactions in a virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>environment at an Australian academic library. </p>

  
<p>A previous study suggests another type of question that would result in high referral rates. According to Kibbee et al. (<a href="#KibbeeWardMa">2002</a>), a service that generates a high proportion of local questions argues against the inter-institutional collaborative service because the questions would not be effectively answered by <i>out0e</i> librarians in the consortium. This is because questions that involve local knowledge (e.g., history, events, or services) or questions that are answerable only by local staff (e.g., use of locally restricted databases or access to patron accounts) tend to result in more referrals back to local libraries. Yet, these speculations should be empirically tested to identify the types of questions that produce more referrals in a collaborative service. The results will serve as important managerial information for designing the practice and policies for virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>services.</p> 

<h3>User satisfaction with referrals</h3> 

<p>While the professional <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>generally encourages the use of referrals as an alternative to <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>answers (<a href="#Reference">Reference and User Services Association 2004</a>), Dewdney and Ross (<a href="#DewdneyRoss">1994</a>) revealed a pitfall of the referral practice by reporting its ineffectiveness from the users' <span>perspective</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> In fact, this contention is <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>by a collaborative online chat <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>use study (<a href="#Kwon">Kwon 2004</a>). According to the <span>finding</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> a mere suggestion of alternative resources or making referrals was not a positive predictor of user satisfaction. That is, unmonitored referrals do not warrant user satisfaction because the question might or might not be <span>ultimately</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>answered.</p> 
  
  <p>A handful of studies has <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the impact of referrals on <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>effectiveness in traditional <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>settings. In the study by Dewdney and Ross (<a href="#DewdneyRoss">1994</a>), most patrons who received unmonitored referrals reported that they found nothing or very little helpful material when they had to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the sources to which <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>staff <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>them. In fact, Douglas (<a href="#Douglas">1988</a>) categorized these referrals as one of the six types of <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>service failures. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> Murfin and Bunge (<a href="#MurfinBunge">1984</a>) reported that the average <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>success rate dropped from 69% to 22% when the librarian was busy and, as a result, made suggestions that were not <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>up, <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>helping the patron with the <span>search</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> Murfin and Bunge maintained that the practice, policy or necessity of directing the user rather than accompanying the user on the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>was a factor that caused librarians to perform far below their potential. All of the above studies <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>apparent problems in the effectiveness of referrals in the traditional physical <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>setting. Yet, there is still a question of how patrons would feel when their questions were <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>as <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to when their questions were answered completely. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> it is also a question how patrons would feel about referrals in a collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>setting. </p>

<p>While many studies have examined the user satisfaction with virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in general, few researchers have <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the satisfaction of the patrons whose questions are answered as referrals in the collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>setting. The present study <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>this issue empirically. </p>

<h2>Method</h2>

<h3>Setting and participants</h3>

<p>The present study examined chat <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>services delivered through the Broward County public library system in Florida. As the largest library system in Florida, it has 33 regional and branch libraries. Since August 2002, the system has used the <i>24/7 Reference</i> chat <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>service delivered by the Metropolitan Cooperative Library System (MCLS), an association of libraries  located in the greater Los Angeles area, funded by a Federal Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) grant. </p>

<p>The data analysed for the present study were on-line chat <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>transactions initiated by the patrons of the Broward Country library system, along with online <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>questionnaires, which the service users completed voluntarily. The questionnaire was <span>devised</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and supplied by <i>24/7 Reference</i> and popped up upon completion of each transaction. While the patrons were mostly the users of the library system, the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>staff who provided the service were from forty-nine library <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>across the United States participating in the MCLS 24/7 Reference programme. During the six-month research <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>between January and June 2004, a total of 1,667 transactions took place and 1,387 were analysable as being either completed or transferred transactions. In order to analyse the influence of referrals on user satisfaction, all 420 transactions that had a corresponding questionnaire that chat service users had submitted immediately after their session to report their satisfaction with the service were chosen. This amounted to 30.1% of the total analysable transactions. By having a chat <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>session transcript with a matching user satisfaction <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>questionnaire, the researcher was able to examine what question was asked in a <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>session, whether the question was answered completely or <span>referred</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> and to what extent the patron was satisfied with the answer or referrals she or he received. </p>

<h3>Measurement of research variables</h3>

<h4>User satisfaction</h4>

<p>User satisfaction was assessed by three indicators: satisfaction with the answer, perceived staff <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> and willingness to use the service again. These indicators were <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>by patrons' responses to three questionnaire items. First, satisfaction with the answer was <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>by asking the question, 'Were you satisfied with the answer you received to your <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>question?' Respondents answered the question by choosing one from 'Yes', 'Not sure' and 'No'. The result shows that, among the 417 respondents who answered this question, 65.2% reported that they were satisfied with the answer received, and 21.1% of the respondents were not sure whether they were satisfied or not. Finally, 12.6% of the respondents reported that they were not satisfied at all.</p>

<p>Perceived staff <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> the second indicator of user satisfaction, was <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>by the user <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to the question, 'The <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of the library staff service in answering this request was _________'. The answer choices were 'Excellent', 'Good', 'Average' and 'Poor'.  According to the <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>(N = 416), 68.2% of the respondents answered that the librarians handling the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>questions were 'Excellent'. About 19.5% answered 'Good' and 11.3% answered 'Poor.' </p>

<p>Finally, Willingness to use the service again, the <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>indicator of user satisfaction, was <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>using the questionnaire item, 'Will you use this service again?' The answer choices were 'Very likely', 'Maybe' and 'Never'. 77.2% of users answered that they were very likely to use the service again 19.0% answered maybe, and only 3.8% said they would never use the service again (N = 417). </p>

<p>The overall user satisfaction was computed by summing up the above three indicators (<a href="#Footnote2">Footnote 1</a>). <span>Measurement</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>research literature indicates that composite variables yield scores that are generally more <span>valid</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>than does a single item 
(<a href="#DeVellis">DeVellis 1991</a>). </p>

<p>In order to determine the reliability and validity of the scores yielded by the composite variable, a reliability <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and a factor analysis were conducted, <span>respectively</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> As a result, a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of .85 was obtained, indicating that the composite variable generated scores were <span>reliable</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> The factor analysis revealed that the three items were <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>by one factor, with structure-pattern <span>coefficients</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of .868, .916, and .876. This factor explained 78.64% of the total variance. This high validity score confirms that the composite variable is measuring a single construct, suggesting that the composite variable is a <span>valid</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>measure of user satisfaction. Finally, the mean of the overall user satisfaction was 12.69 with a standard deviation of 3.44 in the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>between a maximum value of 3 for 'highly dissatisfied' and the minimum value of 15 for 'highly satisfied.'</p>

<h4>Answer completeness</h4>

<p>Answer completeness <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to the level of completeness that library staff answers to the patron's inquiry during the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>transaction. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>content analysis of 420 online chat <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>transaction transcripts was conducted in order to code the levels of answer completeness. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>total of 16 different levels of answer completeness were identified from the initial coding (See the first three columns of <a href="#Table1">Table 1</a>).</p>

<p>Later, the initial sixteen levels of answer completeness were collapsed into four broader categories: completed answer, <span>partial</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>or no answer, referrals, and problematic ending (See the last three columns of <a href="#Table1">Table 1</a>). This <span>reduction</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in the categories helped to remove some ambiguities in the micro-level coding. For example, when a transcript showed an abrupt ending, it was not clear whether it was patron's termination due to delay, librarian's premature ending, or technological <span>failure</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> Thus, a broader category of 'problematic ending' incorporates all of these possibilities constituting an abrupt ending. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>fewer number of answer categories also enables bivariate data analysis that is necessary to answer the research questions. Thus, the final coding for answer completeness categories were defined as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li>A transaction was coded as 'completed answer' if a transcript indicated that the librarian <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the patron <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>answers or sources that may include answers to the patron's question and that the librarian ends the transaction with a proper closure (i.e., Librarians asks the patron if the question have been completely answered and the patron responds positively.). Additional sources of information may be provided to the patron along with the answer to the initial question. In particular, in order to determine a proper closure, specific behavioral items that are prescribed in the 'Guidelines for Behavioral Performance of Reference and Information Services Providers' (<a href="#Reference">2004</a>) were employed. It is the Guidelines that the Reference and User Services Association (RUSA) developed to train <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>staff and to assess their <span>performance</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> The following four items were specifically selected from the Guidelines:

    <blockquote>
<ul>	
      <li>4.7: Asks the patrons if additional information is needed after an initial result is found (e.g., 'is there anything else I can help you with?')</li>
      <li>5.1: Asks patrons if their questions have been completely answered (e.g., 'did you find what you needed?,''does this completely answer your question?')</li>
      <li>5.2: Encourages the patrons to return if they have further questions (e.g., 'If you don't find what you are looking for, please come back and we'll try something else.')</li> 
      <li>5.9: Takes care not to end the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>interview prematurely. </li></ul>
    </blockquote></li> 
	
  
<li>A transaction was coded as 'partial or no answer' if a transcript indicated that the patron's initial question was either partially answered or unanswered and no further <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to other sources or services was provided.</li>

	
<li>A transaction was coded as 'referrals' when a transcript indicated that the patron's initial question was either partially answered or unanswered during the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>transaction but <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>staff gave the patron information sources or contact information that may or may not contain the answer. The <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>staff did not check if the sources had answered the patron's question. </li>
  
<li> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>transaction was coded as 'problematic ending' when a transaction was ended before the patron received the answer due to disconnection, delayed answer, or without clear reason. It also includes librarians' premature ending without proper closing remarks and system <span>failure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>due to connection problems.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Question types</h4>

<p>A content analysis of transaction transcripts was undertaken to identify the types of questions that are submitted to the collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>total of fourteen categories of question types emerged initially. Again, the fourteen categories were collapsed into five broader question types: simple, factual questions, subject-based research questions, resource access questions, circulation-related questions, and local library information inquiries. Below <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of the five types of questions with examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simple, factual question <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to known-item <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>questions, directional  questions, or a question of a factual nature that can be answered quickly by consulting only one or two <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>tools (<a href="#Garnsey">Garnsey &amp; Powell 2000</a>). Examples are 'Is the book <i>Funny Laws and Other Zany Stuff</i> by Sheryl Lindsell-Roberts available?', 'What does 'borrower status: restricted' mean?', and 'What is the correct way to write this name, in last name first order: Dr. James <span>R++</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>J++</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>Smith</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> III?' </li>

<li>Subject-based research question <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to a <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>question requesting a particular kind and number of books or journal/magazine articles on a specific <span>topic</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the steps of the research process, locating hard to find literature, and guidance with database choices (<a href="#MarstellerMizzy">Marsteller &amp; Mizzy 2003</a>; <a href="#Ward">Ward 2004</a>). Examples are 'Can you tell me how to celebrate <span>children</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>s <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in America?', 'I want to know the titles of 5 books that <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>with the development of gender identity', and 'Where can I find a current article on the culture of any indigenous tribe?'</li>

<li>Resource access question <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to an inquiry about access and use of library catalogues, databases or other library resources. Examples are 'How do I access the Oxford <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>Dictionary through the library Website?', 'I'm having trouble accessing my library account. Can you help?' and 'Where can I access NetLibrary to read an e-book?' </li>

<li>Circulation-related question, for the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of this study, <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to an inquiry about circulation policies (e.g., overdues, fines, renewal), online renewals, patron account checking, or other circulation related issues. The answer may or may not be readily found from the Website of the local library. Questions that <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in this category include 'Can you check which  books are overdue in my record?', and 'I saw I have a 60 dollar fine. Is there a payment plan or forgiveness policy I could do to be able to check out books again?'</li>

<li>Local library information inquiries, for the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of this study, <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to a question that involves information about a local library. Questions that <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in this category include 'Can I use a typewriter in Sunrise branch library?' 'I am looking for a job at this library', and 'Where should I e-mail comments about Thursday's 'Balancing the Books' seminar at the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>library? There was no box into which we could anonymously drop the evaluation forms'.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Inter-coder reliability</h4>

<p>Inter-coder reliability <span>tests</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>were undertaken to ensure the consistency of coding for both question types and answer completeness.  The <span>tests</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>show the level of agreement between two independent coders. To <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the inter-coder reliability, the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>researcher coded the entire 420 transactions. Subsequently, the second coder, a <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>librarian who received training for coding the RUSA guideline categories, coded every fifth transaction of the 420 transactions (<em>n</em> = 84). This number comprised 20% of the total transactions, which is a recommended percentage for social science research (<a href="#Neuendorf">Neuendorf 2002</a>).  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>widely used Cohen's Kappa (k) was used as the inter-coder reliability index for this study and was calculated using SPSS 13.0 (<a href="#SPSS">SPSS Inc. 2004</a>). Cohen's Kappa coefficient was found to be 1.00 for question type and .75 for answer completeness, indicating high agreements between the two coders in <span>classifying</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>both variables. </p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<h3>Proportion of referrals and answer completeness</h3>

<p>Research Question 1 examines 'To what extent are questions answered as referrals and to what extent are questions completely answered during collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>sessions?' Both Table 1 and <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>1 show the results of answer completeness based on total transactions (N = 420).</p>

In contrast to referrals, completely answered transactions comprised 56.4% of the transactions, which is very close to the well-known 55% <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>success rate (<a href="#Hernon">Hernon &amp; McClure 1986</a>; <a href="#Saxton">Saxton &amp; Richardson 2002</a>)</p>

<h3>Question types</h3>

<p>As shown in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>1, circulation-related questions were the most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>asked questions of all (48.9%), <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>by subject-based research questions (25.8%), simple factual questions (9.6%), resource access (8.9%) and local library-related information inquiries (6.8%). It should be noted that the high proportion of circulation-related questions seem to partly <span>attribute</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to the fact that the circulation page has a link to the service.</p>

If there are, what types of questions would they be? <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>2 shows the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of answer completeness by question types.</p>

<div align="center">Figure 2: Answer completeness by question types (<em>N</em> = 415)</div>

<p>Figure 2 demonstrates that both simple factual and subject-based research questions were completely answered over 70% of the time and their average referral rates were 5% and 11.2% of total transactions, <span>respectively</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> In the case of circulation and local library information inquiries, answer completion rates were approximately 50% and referral rates were 44.8% and 39.3%, <span>respectively</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>To determine a systematic association between answer completeness and question types, a chi-squared <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>was conducted using a <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>level of .05. According to the <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>result, there was a statistically significant difference in answer completion rates across the five question types, &#967;<sup style="font-size: x-small;">2</sup>  = 71.616 (12 d.f, <em>N</em> = 415), <em>p</em> &lt; .001. The effect size (<a href="#Footnote1">Footnote 2</a>) associated with this relationship, as <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>by Cramer's V, was .24, which suggests a small to <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>effect size. This result indicates that the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of answer completion is highly correlated with the types of questions. Specifically, this result shows that referrals occurred far more <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in circulation and local library information inquiries while substantially fewer referrals were made in both simple factual and subject-based research questions.</p>

<h3>User satisfaction with referrals</h3> 

<p>Research question 3 relates to whether there is any difference in the user satisfaction between referrals and completed answers? To answer this question, the level of user satisfaction was compared across the four answer categories. User satisfaction was highest when the questions were completely answered (Mean = 14.21; SD = 1.88; <em>n</em> = 237), <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>by <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>(Mean = 11.83; SD = 3.40; <em>n</em> = 122), partial/unanswered (Mean = 10.68; SD = 3.91; <em>n</em> = 20), and problematic endings (Mean= 7.54; SD = 3.87; <em>n</em> = 41). With these results, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>was conducted to determine if the user satisfaction of referrals is statistically significantly lower than that of completed answers (Figure 3)</p>

<p>The ANOVA <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>results revealed a statistically significant difference in user satisfaction across the four answer categories at the <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>level of .05, F(3, 416) = 80.341, p &lt; .001. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>post-hoc <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of the overall ANOVA <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>was conducted to determine how the four groups differ by employing Games-Howell <span>test</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> The Games-Howell <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>is con0ered to be robust when <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>sizes and variances are not equal across compared groups (<a href="#Field">Field 2005</a>; <a href="#SPSS">SPSS Inc. 2004</a>). The <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>result revealed that user satisfaction was rated into three different levels, as shown in Table 2.</p>

<p>As Table 2 shows, patrons who obtained complete answers were most satisfied among all groups. Patrons who received referrals were significantly less satisfied than the patrons whose questions were completely answered; however, patrons who received referrals fell into the same satisfaction level as those whose questions were partially answered or unanswered. More importantly, the current study revealed that users were far less satisfied with the referrals than with completed answers and experience only about the same <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of satisfaction as users receiving either a <span>partial</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>answer or no answer at all. Finally, all three groups were statistically significantly more satisfied than patrons who experienced a problematic ending.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>This study <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>referrals in a nationwide, collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>service. Specifically, it examined the extent to which questions are <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in the collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>environment, the types   of questions that are more likely to be <span>referred</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> and whether patrons would be equally satisfied with the <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>answers as with complete answers. This study employed both content analysis of the transcripts of 420 virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>transactions that occurred between January and June 2004 and corresponding self-reported <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>questionnaires that were submitted by the patrons after each transaction. </p>

<p>According to the results of this study, approximately 30% of the questions were answered with referrals. Circulation-related questions were more <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span><span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>back to the local libraries than simple factual or subject-based research questions, mostly due to restriction of access to patron records. The latter two types of questions are non-local, generic questions in nature. These types of questions tend to be more completely answered than either circulation or local library information inquiries which involve more locality-specific knowledge. These <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span><span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that questions <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>local resources tend to create more referrals than questions that involve generic knowledge. More importantly, the current study revealed that users were far less satisfied with the referrals than with completed answers and experience only about the same <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of satisfaction as users receiving either a <span>partial</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>answer or no answer at all. </p>

<p>Regarding this problem of lower user satisfaction with referrals, libraries participating in collaborative services could <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>several <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>for handling this problem. An immediate measure would be to specify the scope of questions explicitly and effectively on the virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>service Web site. As another approach, Braxton and Brunsdale (<a href="#Braxton">2004</a>) suggested that virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>services ask users to check their question types and to describe their questions using a Web form where users can also read the scope of questions available from the service. </p>

<p>Probably a more effective measure to correct the <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of problematic referrals would be to place the <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to the virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>service in the most natural and pertinent locations, that is, at the point of need. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>problem that seems to have contributed to the high <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of circulation-related questions in this study is the location of the link placed on a circulation page. Whenever patrons encountered a circulation-related problem, they seemed to click on the link to get help. However, a large proportion of these circulation-related questions were answerable only by authorized personnel in the patrons' home libraries.</p>

<p>This <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>supports Wells's (<a href="#Wells">2003</a>) argument that proper location of the <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to the virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>services can enhance service effectiveness. According to Gray (<a href="#Gray">2000</a>), both the placement of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to the services on individual Web pages and the number of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to the service <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the Web site <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>affect the amount of question traffic. All these <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in the literature <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>a possible influence of link locations on the types of questions asked of virtual <span>reference</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>However, the results of this study do not support Gray's other recommendation, 'services that provide <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>on the bottom of all pages, on a <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>navigation bar, or on a help menu featured <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the site will provide users with more opportunity to ask questions at the point of need' (<a href="#Gray">Gray 2000: 369</a>). According to the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of this study, not all <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>placed at the point of need helped the patrons especially when it does not guarantee answers. For instance, the present study reported 45% of questions asked via a link on the circulation page were answered as referrals and therefore patrons had to contact their home library again. These <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>also <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that a link on the circulation page unnecessarily increases circulation question traffic within the collaborative service. As the current <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span><span>indicate</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> user satisfaction with referrals was significantly lower than completed answers. Patrons seemed to have experienced confusion and frustration or felt they had wasted their time in this process. Referrals made back to the local library would work against the anticipated benefits of effective allocation of resources. Regarding this <span>finding</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> a usability study could be conducted to empirically examine relationships between the locations of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and the service effectiveness. </p>

<p>Despite the apparent problems in some referrals, they seem to be generally encouraged and <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>staff seem to believe referrals are legitimate answers to <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>questions (<a href="#Reference">Reference and User Services Association, 2004</a>). However, the fact that librarians are advised to offer referrals when they do not provide the answer does not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>mean that referrals are effective in all circumstances. The <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of this study <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that librarians should be able to <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>between two types of referrals: the 'expert research' referrals conducive to collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>services (e.g., sharing expertise and resources in answering difficult subject-based research questions); and the 're-directional, local' referrals that increase unnecessary question traffic, thereby being detrimental to effective use of collaborative <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>(e.g., referring patrons back to local libraries to resolve circulation disputes). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span><span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>implication of this <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>is that two types of referrals should be <span>properly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>addressed in <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>staff training so that staff can make referrals most effectively. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span><span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>study could compare the two types of referrals to further understand contingent conditions of those referrals. In relation to this, another interesting agenda of further research would be to compare the patrons and the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>staff for their <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>toward referrals. </p>

<h2>Conclusion and implications of the study</h2>

<p>While there are many expectations and promises in the emerging collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>service, the present study demonstrated some gaps in the current service delivery by investigating referrals. One limitation of the present study, however, is the fact that the study was conducted at a single public library system although the librarians <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>were from forty-nine different library <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>participating in a nationwide collaborative chat <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>programme. Thus, the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of the present study should be further confirmed by replicating the study in libraries of different types and sizes. </p>

<p>As another limitation, it should be noted that the present study included only the transactions that had a completed questionnaire. These transactions comprise only 30% of the total of 1387 analysable transactions. Con0ering the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that the patrons who completed the questionnaire may not <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the entire  user population accurately, the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of the present study should be substantiated by further research.</p>

  <p>Despite these limitations, the results of this study provide several implications for <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>practice and research. First, from the <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>perspective, the current study empirically demonstrated that generic <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>questions, such as simple factual and subject-based research questions, are more effectively answered than locality-specific questions. These <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>can help local libraries make informed decisions on such issues as whether they go global or remain local in providing the service. The study also demonstrated empirically that the patrons did not value referrals to a great extent. This <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>suggests that librarians should not <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>all referrals as equally good alternatives to completed answers. Most importantly, local libraries can minimize confusion and frustration of their users by evaluating the current locations of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>  to virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and manage the question traffic to provide proper directions for the patrons. This should also reduce the frustration of <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>staff who might have to end their sessions without offering satisfying answers and help them to spend their time and expertise more wisely with the questions that they could better answer. </p>
  
  <p>From the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>research <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> it can be contended that the present study addressed complex phenomena <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>a seemingly simple behaviour of making referrals. The <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>certainly redirect our <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to the concept of 'unmonitored referrals' that Dewdney and Ross  (<a href="#DewdneyRoss">1994</a>) had proposed from their research in the physical <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>setting. While supporting their claims about the problems in unmonitored referrals, the present study suggests that referrals could bring both positive and negative implications to collaborative virtual <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>services. In this <span>regard</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> the use of referrals must be one such area that Whitlatch (<a href="#Whitlatch">2004</a>) pointed out to assure patrons' satisfaction in the current <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>service <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>where new technology can create both opportunities and threats. Since further understanding of referrals is critical to maximize the user satisfaction in collaborative services, continuing efforts to conceptualize referrals in multiple dimensions are anticipated to fully grasp complex phenomena <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>referrals. </p>

<p><a name="Footnote1" id="Footnote1"></a>1. In creating a composite variable, a series of computations was conducted because the three items in the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>questionnaire were <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>on a three-point or four-point ordinal scale (e.g., 'satisfied,' 'not sure,' and 'not satisfied' for the 'satisfaction with the answer' item). These ordinal level measures are not <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to undertake <span>inferential</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>statistical <span>tests</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> such as ANOVA, that are necessary to answer research question 3 of the present study. To resolve this <span>conflict</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> the existing three questionnaire items were recoded and transformed   into a composite variable to increase the variability of the measure. First, the ordinal level data variables were rescaled on a five-point scale as shown below: </p>

<p>  As shown on the above diagram, for satisfaction with the answer item, 1 was assigned for 'unsatisfied,' 2 for 'not sure,' and 5 for 'satisfied.' For perceived staff <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>item, 1 was assigned for 'poor,' 3 for 'average,' 4 for 'excellent.' For willingness to return item, 1 was assigned for 'never,' 3 for 'maybe,' and 5 for 'very likely.'</p>

  <p>After the three items were rescaled on the same five-point scale, they were summed as a single composite variable, with a minimum value of 3 and a maximum value of 15. This procedure of data management allowed the researcher to conduct the necessary <span>inferential</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>statistical <span>tests</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<h1>Call for Papers:  Activity Theory and Information Studies</h1>

<p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%; font-size: small; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">
Contributions are invited for a thematic issue of Information Research on Activity Theory in Information Studies to be published in April 2007. <a href="../ATLinks.html" target="_blank"><strong>Activity Theory</strong></a>, developed in the Soviet Union in the 1930s has become widely used in education, information systems, and human-computer interaction.  To date, its application in information management, information science and librarianship has been limited, but the potential for its application is considerable. We will particularly welcome contributions based on research in digital libraries, information systems development, information behaviour, information literacy and information management generally. Theoretical papers on the links between activity theory and other conceptual frameworks will also be welcome. All contributions will be peer reviewed.
</p>

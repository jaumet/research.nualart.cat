<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>In a review of papers given at an earlier ISIC conference Gaslikova (<a href="#gas99">1999</a>) suggested that there was a potential benefit from a flow of ideas between the information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>developers and the ISIC <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>  However, as <span>Ellis</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span><em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ell99">1999</a>) noted the flow of information and ideas between these research communities is <span>limited</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>  In this paper we bring together a pressing and rapidly developing research <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>community; the use and development of mobile information and communications technologies, with core areas of research interest within the information behaviour literature; managers' information behaviour (<a href="#cho93">Choo and Auster 1993</a>, <a href="#nie03">Nied&#378;wiedzka 2003</a>, <a href="#kat92">Katzer and Fletcher 1992</a>,   <a href="#dea01">de Alwis, and Higgins 2001</a>, <a href="#cor97">Correia and Wilson 1997</a>) and  information overload (<a href="#all03">Allen and Wilson 2003</a>).</p>

<p>A <span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>number of professional organizations are seeking to extend their information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to an increasingly mobile workforce. Technological advancement and the promised rewards of mobile working have led to an 'explosion' in mobile computing and telecommunications technologies in recent years (<a href="#gre02">Green 2002</a>). This has seen a <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>growth in the use of wireless laptop computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs) and other handheld <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>for data transfer and communication. <span>Nevertheless</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> despite the rapid and continuing adoption of mobile <span>devices</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> most literature to date has been primarily concerned with the subject of static computing (<a href="#wei01">Weilenmann 2001</a>).  Although a small but <span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>body of work explores the use of mobile information and communication technologies to expedite 'field work' (for example; <a href="#rao00">Rao 2000</a>; <a href="#wat00">Watad &amp; DiSanzo 2000</a> ), there has been, thus far, no identifiable research on its use by those in a senior management role. This is despite the fact that many more senior managers and professional workers in organizations are now able, through the use of technology, to work from remote locations (<a href="#oma99">O'Mahony &amp; Barley 1999</a>). Dryer<em> et al.</em> (<a href="#dry99">1999</a>) believe that the <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in the use of portable <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>means that computers are becoming more pervasive, with connotations of an invasive technology. Indeed, the inability to escape from computers and information is a theme seen in the literature of mobile information and communication technologies' (e.g., <a href="#dry99">Dryer <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>; <a href="#wei01">Weilenmann 2001</a>) and research on information overload (e.g., <a href="#tid99">Tidline 1999</a>; <a href="#whi00">White &amp; Dorman 2000</a>). Whilst information overload has been identified as a general problem, no substantial research has been identified that examines the impact of mobile technologies on the users' experience of information overload. The study reported in this paper, therefore, was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>as a small-scale inductive exploration of this area.</p>

<h3>The research context</h3>

<p>This research investigates the use of wireless <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>(BlackBerry<sup><font size="-1">TM</font></sup> handhelds) by senior officers in the West Yorkshire Police. These <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>use Global Packet Radio Service (GPRS), always-on, wireless networking and are used primarily for sending and receiving e-mails (using Lotus Notes). Diary and organizer <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>(using synchronisation with the officer's personal computer) are used and the device also acts as a telephone with voice-mail facility.  At the time of the study, the <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>had been in use for approximately ten months. The implementation started with the senior management (Senior Command Team and heads of department) <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>approximately thirty <span>units</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 

<p>Some research has been undertaken recently on the use of mobile <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in relation to front-line  police work (for example, <a href="#nul03">Nulden 2003</a>; <a href="#agr03">Agrawal <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>), but not on officers with a middle or senior management role. These managers play a key role as information intermediaries and, because of the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of mobile information and communication technologies, face a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of adjustments to traditional ways of working.</p>

<h3>Information Overload</h3>

<p>The use of mobile technology is associated with an increasing amount of information at the user's disposal (<a href="#lan01">Lang 2001</a>). The twin themes of a <span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span><span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of information and increasing <span>exposure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to it are reflected in the information overload literature. Whilst information overload has not been explored in the context of mobile information and communication technologies, the potential for this to be a problem has been identified. For example, there is a <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in the literature that information overload has been exacerbated by the recent rapid advances made in information and communication technology (<a href="#edm00">Edmunds &amp; Morris 2000</a>). </p>

<p>According to Miller (<a href="#mil78">1978</a>), information overload results from the inability of living <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to process excessive <span>amounts</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of information. Combined with the fact that technology can generate information much faster than people can process it, this means that people often find themselves unable to cope with an increasing amount of information (<a href="#cha01">Chan 2001</a>). <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> Marcusohn, for example, states that information overload 'may originate both from information actively requested/searched for and information received 'inertly' (i.e. received whether or not the recipient wants/needs it or not)'. (<a href="#mar95">Marcusohn 1995</a>: 36)</p> 

<p>Information overload is <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to in a variety of ways in the literature - data smog (<a href="#she97">Shenk 1997</a>), data delirium (<a href="#sta97">Sapinski 1997</a>) and information fatigue syndrome (<a href="#opp97">Oppenheim 1997</a>). However one terms it, it is seen as a problem that can manifest itself in a number of ways. Uncontrolled and unorganized information can hinder learning and decision-making (<a href="#cha01">Chan2001</a>; <a href="#far02">Farhoomand &amp; Drury 2002</a>), reduce productivity and can have negative effects on health and well-being (<a href="#whi00">White &amp; Dorman 2000</a>). </p>

<p>E-mail is most widely identified in the recent literature as the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>contributor. According to Dawley and Anthony (<a href="#daw03">2003</a>), this is often due to peer misuse and <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of training. That is, it is not technology that causes information overload, but rather its use (or rather, its misuse). Hence, in order to research the problem it is necessary to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>managers' information and communication behaviour. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> it is also necessary to examine the information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and the organizational culture - i.e., the <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that frame management behaviour. This paper, therefore, examines elements that drive and mediate the information flows and information behaviour within an organization. </p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>In this project, the case study approach is adopted, as complementary to an incremental approach to theory building. An inductive approach is adopted, in which data are collected and the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>are interpreted in the light of previous work. The interpretative element helps the researcher to understand human thought and <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in social and organizational <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#kle99">Klein &amp; Myers 1999</a>). </p>

<p>This paper also draws upon grounded theory (<a href="#gla67">Glaser &amp; Strauss 1967</a>), using a 'cycle of induction and deduction' to generate a contextual understanding of reality (<a href="#gum00">Gummesson 1999</a>). The initial interviews informed the development of a conceptual model of the drivers and mediators of information flows and information overload, within a complex organization. The elements of this model (and their interactions) were then explored in greater detail in the interviews. Finally, to validate the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of the interviews and to add some depth to the research, the officers' secretaries were also questioned. These secretaries are well-placed to comment on changes information behaviour as they act as information intermediaries or <em>filters</em> (<a href="#hod02">Hodgkinson &amp; Sparrow 2002</a>) for managers and regularly facilitate and organize the flow of information in the organization. </p>

<h2>Results and discussion</h2>

<p>From the interviews with officers, it is evident that information overload exists in West Yorkshire Police <span>Force</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>at personal and organizational levels. This results from a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of factors including the complex and rapidly changing police <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> In common with many large, public-sector organizations, a great <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of information flows to and from internal departments and external organizations, and the regulatory <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>requires substantial audit trails and documentation. The structure is one of command and control, with hierarchical relationships <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>reporting up and down the ranks. These factors (and others) result in a large <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of information for managers to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with. The extent to which this is seen as a problem, however, <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> personality and subjective experience of the individual officers, and on how they define 'overload'. Their <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>are framed in an <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of hard work and a culture of being able to cope and 'getting the job done'. Thus, some officers <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that overload was not a problem, in the sense that it was within their (personal) capabilities to handle an excess of information. However, most officers stated that information overload was a significant issue for the <span>Force</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 

<p>The use of mobile information and communication technologies was found to have had an impact on work patterns and social <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>within West Yorkshire Police. These work patterns are intimately linked with the information behaviour of managers and the <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of communication and technologies employed. Hence, a conceptual model of the <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and relationships between the key elements that drive and mediate the information flows and information behaviour within a complex organizational <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>was developed (see <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>1).</p>

<h3>The Impact of Mobile Devices on Information Overload </h3>

<p>E-mail was cited by most officers as the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>cause of personal information overload. This is reflected in a number of other studies (for example: <a href="#whi97">Whittaker &amp; Sidner 1997
</a>; <a href="#daw03">Dawley &amp; Anthony 2003</a>). However, the use of mobile information and communication technologies in West Yorkshire Police was found not to have significantly contributed towards the problem (although a small overall increase in e-mail traffic may be identified). For the majority of officers, the <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of messages sent and received has remained unchanged. Typical responses include: '<em>I don't feel as if I've had any more messages. I don't think people send me any more messages because they know I've got a BlackBerry</em>' [1] and '<em>the <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>hasn't significantly increased</em>' [2] and also '<em>I think it's the same</em>' [3]. This was <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>by the officers' secretaries, who also reported no significant change in <span>volume</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> Some officers, however, <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that the <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>had risen slightly as a result of the ability to work faster and 'move things on' more quickly. Greater <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with colleagues was also cited as marginally increasing the flow of e-mails: 'we'll exchange a few e-mails - an exchange that might not have otherwise taken place'[6]. Additional e-mails are often simply acknowledgements of receipt, or courtesy messages and are not seen as representing a significant increase in communication. Any increase can be attributed to the ways  officers use the <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and how they interact and collaborate with colleagues.</p>

<p>The second most common <span>cause</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of information overload was the amount of information officers deemed necessary to acquire. This is driven partly by the requirements of the managers' <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and the uncertainty in police work, but it also results from a level of information anxiety (<a href="#whi97">Wurman 1990</a>) and a vague sense that additional information is needed (more, in fact, than could be used). As one officer commented, '<em>what <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to be the problem for [me] in terms of information overload, is there are a lot of things going on out there that I feel I need to know more about, but I don't have the time</em>' [4]. Allen and Wilson (<a href="#whi97">2002</a>) <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that the need for cognition (i.e., to structure and understand) can sometimes extend into a 'pathological state' of information pull. In West Yorkshire Police, managers <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>feel that, despite being overwhelmed by information, they need more. This issue has not been <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>affected by the use of mobile <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>as the BlackBerrys were used mainly for e-mailing.</p> 

<p>The nature of communications was found to have changed when mediated by mobile technology. Given the smaller keyboard and the use of the <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>on a train or at home, users tend to send messages that are '<em>short, sharp and to the point</em>' [2]. Messages sent become less formal and less complex than when using a standard <span>PC</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> One officer noted that sending messages on a BlackBerry is '<em>akin to texting</em>' [1] (on a mobile telephone). This reduced formality seems also to inform the recipients' behaviour - colleagues (not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>BlackBerry users) tend to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in kind: '<em>what I'm <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>is that messages are [a] lot shorter coming back</em>' [1]. Shorter, less complex messages, however, can be of low value and ambiguous (informational properties cited by Sparrow (<a href="#whi97">1998</a>) as contributing to information overload). Shorter messages may have to be clarified: '<em>you might not get enough information in there... there's a danger... that you then need to go through the hoops again</em>' [4]. This may be the result of a 'real' information inadequacy (see <a href="#whi97">Spender &amp; Eden 1998</a>) or a product of information anxiety.</p>

<p>The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>impact on information overload was found to be through the individual's ability to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with the information received. The capability to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with messages and information requests whilst on the <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>or from a remote location <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to have a 'smoothing' effect on the individual's information processing. Rather than <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with a barrage of messages following time away from the office, users are able to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with the more important communications remotely. Thus, users are able to 'stay on top of things'. One officer notes:</p> 

<blockquote>I think it's shared the overload out... there's still overload but it's shared out now, so <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of coming back to the office and there's fifteen e-mails, I can be looking at them quite <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>when I'm away from the office. So, in <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>fact, when I get into my office to do my work, it's a manageable <span>volume</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> [3].</blockquote>

<p>However, managers still need to decide what is important. This will <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>on their role in the organization as well as on their individual needs, desires, personality, motivations and <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>for coping with overload. What is important is also determined by the pressures and demands of the information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and the organizational context. Organization norms of conduct will also serve to control the way virtual work is undertaken (<a href="#nol98">Nolan and Galal 1998</a>).</p>

<h3>The information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and organizational context</h3>

<p>Huotari and Wilson (<a href="#huo01">2001</a>) define organizational information behaviour in terms of the 'systems and services that are <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to acquire, share and disseminate information of all <span>kinds</span>' <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>. This includes information that circulates through formal and informal means, both internally and externally. Thus, one needs to appreciate the information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and organizational context in order to understand the complex ways in which information flows in, out and around the organization, and how this contributes towards information overload.</p>

<p>Marcusohn (<a href="#mar95">1995</a>) reports that greater complexity and environmental uncertainty increases information processing requirements and, thereby, information overload. West Yorkshire Police <span>Force</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>operates in a complex and changing police <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> with information flowing to and from external organizations (such as the Home Office and the local Police Authority), as well as through a number of internal hierarchies and departments. The highly structured organization <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to generate highly structured and often large <span>amounts</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of information. Typical officers' comments include: '<em>there's far too much form-filling unfortunately... very often it's just for information's sake</em>' [4] and '<em>people at the operational front end are bogged-down with form-filling and other such bureaucratic issues</em>' [6]. According to Driver <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#dri93">1993</a>), high time-pressure, frequent deadlines, complex tasks, high uncertainty, unpredictable events and important decision <span>consequences</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>also contribute towards information load.</p>

<p>In a large, hierarchical organization such as West Yorkshire Police <span>Force</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> it can be difficult for individuals to be noticed. As one respondent put it; '<em>you're always <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>for somebody else's attention</em>' [1]. This results in individuals increasingly copying their colleagues in on e-mails, perhaps in an attempt to make an impression on their superiors. As Wilson (<a href="#wil00">2000</a>) notes, an individual may sometimes be more interested in seeking approval or recognition, than in the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>subject content of the message. Keeping people <em>in the loop</em> is also seen as important within the <span>Force</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and officers copy messages to othersto create an audit trail: '<em>I want to be very explicit... I want to have an audit trail. You can't be leaving gaps in the communication where misinterpretations can be made</em>' [4].</p>

<p>The creation of audit trails results partly from the external requirements placed on the service to record information in a particular way, and partly because of the individual's own agenda: '<em>it's less the requirements of my job; it's a little bit more insurance really. Covering my own back... ensuring that the people who need to know something know it</em>' [6]. But, as Hodgkinson and Sparrow (<a href="#hod02">2002</a>) point out, information that is useful for one <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>is often superfluous for another. Thus, officers regularly receive information that is not relevant to their role, adding to their information load. As one officer points out; '<em>you have to read it to know that you didn't need to read it!</em>' [7]. Farhoomand and Drury (<a href="#far02">2002</a>) show that it can be difficult for people to identify relevant information from the <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>at hand and that decision <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>can suffer as a consequence. Mass copying of information also results in <span>duplication</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and further contributes to information overload: '<em>very often you'll receive the same information from two or three different sources</em>' [6].</p>

<p> The culture of the organization has been <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>towards a more open information <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> with information being shared more freely and widely across the <span>Force</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> This more inclusive atmosphere results in a greater <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of information being made available to the individual; '<em>I think it's possibly a cultural change that people will be more inclusive than exclusive with copying people in</em>' [2]. There is also a culture of hard work. The officers interviewed were used to working from home and <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of normal working hours. Interestingly, because most of the officers interviewed were accustomed to this way of working, the use of mobile <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>at home was seen as acceptable working practice. Indeed, individuals welcomed the convenience of the <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>as they are more portable and quicker and easier to start-up than laptops or PCs. </p>   

<p>Senior officers can (and do) use colleagues to retrieve or summarise information on their behalf. This serves to moderate information overload by reducing the time spent on information seeking or filtering. <span>Nevertheless</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> a level of information anxiety still exits for many senior officers. Wurman describes information anxiety as 'the ever-widening gap between what we understand and what we think we should understand' (<a href="#wur90">Wurman 1990</a>: 34). Thus, despite an acknowledgement that they had more information to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with than they could process, individuals still wanted more. Typical responses included: '<em>I'd rather get just a little more than I need [so] that I can decide [what] to trash</em>' [2] and '<em>I'm the kind of <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that wants to know what's happening... so it's up to me to filter out... I can look at something and just... ditch it</em>' [3]. Other authors report this as a general problem. Oppenheim (<a href="#opp97">1997</a>) notes, for example, that managers <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>feel that they do not have all the information they need, despite being overwhelmed by too much information. Similarly, Hwang and Lin (<a href="#hwa99">1999</a>) report that managers often have a tendency to want as much information as possible.</p>

<h3>Work patterns and personal interactions</h3>

<p>Whilst the use of mobile information and communication technologies serves to blur the boundaries between work and other activities (<a href="#hwa98">Weilenmann 2001</a>), working at home was not seen as a problem as this was already normal practice: '<em>historically, I've always done a bit of work at home</em>' [1]. Indeed, using the <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span><span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of the conventional work <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>is seen by users as beneficial, especially in terms of the ability to manage their workload. <span>Nevertheless</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> the potential for the device to eat into personal time and space was noted by a couple of respondents and, for some officers, using the device has meant longer working hours: '<em>what it means is longer days, but, hopefully, more effective days</em>' [4]. Officers already work long hours, which is identified by Alexander and Walker (<a href="#hwa98">1996</a>) as having an adverse impact on police officers' spouses and <span>families</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> Hence, where mobile technologies increase the number of hours worked, this may compound any pre-existing problems</p>

<p>Managers tended to view as a personal decision when to use the <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>at home or in social situations. As one user remarked: '<em>you've got to be disciplined about it; you've got to draw the <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and say 'actually I'm not switching it on' on holiday</em>' [4]. Not all officers have found this an easy balancing act; however, as one interviewee comments:</p> 

<blockquote>I used to have it as a <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>companion, which is wonderful, but I found that I was answering my e-mail at ten o'clock at night when I should've been watching football or whatever. I found that I was almost at work eighteen or twenty hours a <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>as a result of that. [6]</blockquote> 

<p>In West Yorkshire Police, users have settled into their own patterns of use and have found what is acceptable to them; one noted, '<em>I'm very much more selective about when I have the thing with me now</em>' [6]. The intrusion of mobile technology into users' personal lives was seen by interviewees as an acceptable trade-off for the personal productivity and flexibility benefits.</p> 

<p>Sending messages to subordinates <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>normal hours was not viewed by managers as problematic (most staff under their command had not been issued with the devices). This view is corroborated by the officers' secretaries - whilst some had noticed an increase in messages sent by their managers at night or at the weekend, this had not caused them to change their own working patterns: '<em>more e-mails sent out-of-hours has not meant me working extra hours</em>' [S2]. Whether or not this becomes an issue as the <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>become more widespread remains to be seen. Nor was collaborating with other senior officers out-of-hours con0ered a problem, as this is regarded as a necessary practice. This may be driven by a number of factors, such as high workload, the <span>inherent</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>nature of police work, the high motivation of senior police managers, competition for <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>or information anxiety.</p>

<p>Using the BlackBerry has helped officers manage their workload and ease the pressure of work. As one officer said; '<em>what it's enabled me to do is to spread the workload out... to my optimum... benefit</em>' [1]. The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>theme  from the interviews is the increased flexibility that the individual officer has to organize his or her working <span>day</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> All the respondents appreciated this flexibility: '<em>It means I can <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and initiate things when I want to do it, rather than have to wait to be back at the desk - and I travel a fair bit, so it's very handy to be able to take my <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with me... it just increases my flexibility</em>' [2] and '<em>the handheld device gives you that <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>anywhere and it therefore adds that flexibility to be able to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with [communications] <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>the office <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>.. so it's <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>flexibility</em>' [4]. The officers' secretaries also appreciated this increased flexibility: one commented that receiving messages sooner, '<em>often gives me more notice</em>' [S3].</p>

<p style="line-height: 24px;">The <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>have also helped managers to save time by using <em>dead time</em>. For example; '<em>it's allowed me to do minutes and reports of meetings whilst I'm on the train... which has saved time</em>' [2]. The diary and organizer functions of the BlackBerry have also helped some respondents with time management. In addition, remote access was found to help users to prepare for the <span>day</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>s work. For example, senior officers are e-mailed the <em>chief's log</em> <sup><font size="-1"><a href="#note2">2</a></font></sup>  which they can access from home in the morning or whilst travelling to work and, thereby, are suitably briefed before arriving.</p>
 
<p>The officers interviewed <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that using mobile technologies has helped to speed up decision making. As one officer notes, '<em>a lot of [e-mails] are requests for decisions... and I can make that decision on the <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>rather than delaying it</em>' [7]. Similarly: '<em>what it's enabled me to do as a manager is to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to their requests more quickly</em>' [1]. Thus, managers are able to give an immediate <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to requests for information and authorisation. There is also a <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of decisions made may have become more robust; partly because timeliness is an <span>inherent</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span><span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of <em>good</em> information and partly because officers feel '<em>better informed</em>' [3]. Managers also have easier access to other decision makers: '<em>it should improve decision making by the fact that you can consult more readily with somebody</em>' [7] and collaboration with colleagues is seen to have increased. Using the handheld <span>devices</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> messages often circulate among a group of managers, each of whom is able to contribute without the need to be co-located. This has resulted in faster decision making and has helped managers to conclude issues more rapidly. The ability of mobile technologies to enable <em>continuous collaboration</em> among colleagues is reported in the wider literature (e.g., <a href="#dry99">Dryer <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>; <a href="#mar02">Marsic <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>).</p> 

<p>Whilst the majority of respondents reported that they were now able to work more effectively and make quicker decisions, one officer <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that using a mobile device from home had allowed him to ponder decisions away from immediate work pressures:</p> 

<blockquote>I don't like to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to queries immediately... I like to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>on issues before I <span>respond</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>Sometimes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>your reflection time is at home relaxing and chewing a problem over and the BlackBerry can allow me to give a <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>during the evening at home. [6] </blockquote>

<p>Most respondents <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that the <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>enable them to keep their colleagues better informed, although again this may be driven by competition for <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>or information anxiety. There is also a danger that this may serve to contribute to a colleague's information overload. As one officer warns, '<em>you've got an onus on yourself... if I don't want rubbish back I shouldn't be copying people in on things they don't need to know about</em>' [4]. However, the desire to keep people <em>in the loop</em> and to create audit trails often results in officers sending information <em>just in case</em>: '<em>I would think that some people say that I send too much out, but I'd rather let people know - it's up to them whether they open it or not</em>' [3].</p>
 
<p>The use of the <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>has also had the effect of removing information intermediaries from the <span>chain</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> For example, managers report that they now sometimes type their own responses or instructions without waiting to get back to the office for their secretaries to do so. They say this saves time, speeds up decision making and <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to make communications shorter and less formal. However, a note of caution in necessary. The removal of secretaries (who often act as information <em>filters</em>) is noted by Hodgkinson and Sparrow (<a href="#hod02">2002</a>) as a contributing factor to information overload for managers by them <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>on a greater proportion of information processing themselves. Interestingly, the officers' secretaries could not confirm that they had been bypassed in the communication <span>chain</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> However, it might be <span>impossible</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>for secretaries to know that they have been left out of certain communications, where they have not been party to those communications in the first place.</p>

<h3>The information behaviour of managers</h3>

<p>Huotari and Wilson (<a href="#huo01">2001</a>) define human information behaviour as 'the totality of behaviour (active or passive) that people engage in to gain access to, organize and use information'. This behaviour may be deliberate or more unconscious, instinctive actions, although individuals usually tend to choose and use information sources that are <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>accessible (<a href="#che98">Cheuk 1998</a>). Behaviour <span>differs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>depending on whether information is pushed to individuals or pulled towards themselves (<a href="#huo01">Huotari and Wilson 2001</a>). In West Yorkshire Police it was found that information sent <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to officers (such as e-mails) cannot be avoided entirely and, therefore, is usually given greater <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>than information that must be retrieved from corporate databases. One officer illustrates this point: '<em>there's personal stuff and then there's corporate stuff; the corporate stuff you're <span>supposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to be having a look at, but I feel that people now are that overloaded with stuff to look at and I feel that these things are getting put to one 0e</em>' [1]. </p>

<p>To avoid information overload, individuals employ process or coping <span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> which may be either conscious or unconscious and can potentially become dysfunctional. Filtering, omission and <span>error</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>are among the coping <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>listed by Wilson (<a href="#wil95">1995</a>) and are clearly in evidence within West Yorkshire Police. Officers prioritise and filter e-mails received, deciding what is pertinent to their job or what is of particular interest to them individually. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> because of time constraints, officers often take a <em>fire-fighting</em> approach to information management. Here, they have a tendency to prioritise messages that can be most <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>processed, thereby creating a (largely self-deceiving) sense of having <em>got through the worst of it</em>. Thus, information is given selective <span>attention</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> As one officer notes: '<em>the BlackBerry allows me to pick out [the e-mails] that I can <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and quickly answer, or ones that I realise need urgent attention</em>' [6]. Filtering e-mails can mean, however, that important information is missed (omission) or processed incorrectly (error): '<em>the thing is, you tend to switch off after a bit of time doing stuff and you tend to skip over stuff. And then what happens is, you skip over something you shouldn't skip over because you've that much to bloody read</em>' [1]. Here, the amount of data received exceeds the individual's <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>ability or the time available to process information.</p>

<p>Strategies such as queuing, approximation, multi-parallel processing and escaping (<a href="#wil95">Wilson 1995</a>) are employed to a greater or lesser extent within the <span>Force</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> For example, approximation (or responding in a non-precise way) is evident and is indeed further encouraged by the use of the devices: '<em>I rarely send long, <span>complicated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>messages on the BlackBerry... I tend to keep it fairly short and simple</em>' [7]. This <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of detail can generate a request for clarification from the recipient. Officers also use queuing (or hoping to catch up later) as a way of dealing with less important information. For example,</p> 

<blockquote>I will get a big <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of things that look useful, I'll print a <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of them off and then I'll scan them and think 'right, I can justify leaving those for a month or two'. Then maybe one <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in a month or two's time I will go through [them]' [4]. </blockquote>

<p>It is unlikely, however, that all the information that has been queued will later be processed (resulting in further omission). It was found that through the use of mobile technologies, managers are now more likely to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with information received sooner (often as and when they receive it). This results in less queuing of messages, but filtering and selective <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>strategies still prevail. </p>

<p>Some officers are inclined to target out-of-hours communications to colleagues that they think are more likely to have their BlackBerry switched on: '<em>If I know somebody has got one and he doesn't use it I might be less likely to approach them in those situations where they're not going to be in the office</em>' [4]. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> individuals who are <em>always on</em> are generally seen in a more positive light by their co-workers. Whilst this does increase collaboration with (certain) colleagues, it does mean that these individuals are exposed to greater levels of <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> Most officers interviewed took a pragmatic view of this increased <span>exposure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to interaction: '<em>it's got to be an advantage that people can get <span>hold</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of you all the time. There's times when it's a bit wearying, but it's the nature of the job</em>' [7]. </p>

<p>As well as employing personal information <span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> officers in West Yorkshire Police tend to leave the <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>switched off when in social situations (except when on call) and avoid <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>on holiday with them (escaping strategies). However, not all officers find it easy to escape from <span>interaction</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> and some find it difficult to resist checking or answering messages: '<em>it bleeps and you think "I've got an e-mail and oh, I'll just have a look"</em>' [6]. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>couple of those interviewed confessed to using the <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>whilst in meetings (e.g., if they were '<em>bored with the meeting</em>' [1]), although one officer thought that this practice was '<em>bad manners... and it means the <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>s not concentrating on what's happening</em>' [3].</p>

<p>In West Yorkshire Police, it was found that the requirement to log-on to access certain information can mean that corporate information often remains unread. '<em>They don't bother <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>it now or seeing it... because it's just another thing to log on to the computer</em>' [1] remarked one officer referring to colleagues in the <span>Force</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> Applying Dervin's (<a href="#der92">1992</a>) model, the cost of closing the corporate information gap is seen by some officers as exceeding the benefits of the outcome. Thus, as Stenmark (<a href="#ste98">1998</a>) notes, the time and effort required to actively seek information can often make this a low-priority task. Those interviewed expressed a desire to be able to access corporate databases through their BlackBerry: '<em>mobile data is something that would be a tremendous advantage to us - for example the Police National Computer</em>' [7]. This facility, were it provided, might mean that corporate information would receive more <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>from officers. They would also welcome the ability to attach <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>(although one thought that this might <span>cause</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>problems because of the <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>capacity of the device). These possibilities were not seen by those interviewed as likely to contribute towards information overload - the consensus being that they would have to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with the information anyway. <span>Nevertheless</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> this capability might further serve to blur the boundaries between work and other activities, particularly given the officers' workload and the existing information anxiety within the <span>Force</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>Technology and <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of communication</h3>

<p>E-mail was identified by the majority of officers interviewed as the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>cause of personal information overload: '<em>I think e-mail is to blame largely</em>' [6]. Moreover, the fact that it is a simple matter to copy e-mails to colleagues seems to encourage officers to do so: '<em>it's so easy to press a button</em>' [7]. However, the BlackBerry <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>are seen in a positive light and as a logical <span>extension</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of the computerisation of the police service. Their use is perceived to have reduced the amount of paper-based communication within the Force: '<em>it's reduced even further the amount of pen-to-paper</em>' [2] (although one officer complained that he was still '<em>struggling to keep on top of paperwork</em>' [7]). Some officers thought that the number of telephone communications may have also been reduced. This was also seen positively by the officer's secretaries: '<em>it's good to be able to keep in touch by sending typed messages rather than [by] phone</em>'[S1].</p>

<p>No respondents <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that mobile technologies had noticeably taken the place of face-to-face meetings (although the level of face-to-face communication had already been reduced by the widespread use of e-mail). Interestingly, spending time attending to e-mails or using the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in the office is seen by many officers as merely administration and not real police work. Thus, if officers can process more messages whilst at home, additional time becomes available for face-to-face meetings (which are highly valued in the Force). As one officer comments, by dealing with e-mails before arriving at the office, '<em>I'm much quicker into what I would <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>the 'productive' work... I'm able to interact with people... rather than doing the impersonal <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>which can be done anywhere</em>' [4]. Introna (<a href="#int97">1997</a>) notes that managers prefer interpersonal face-to-face communication as this has a contextual and involvement dimension not present in technologically-mediated communication.</p>

<h3>Conclusions </h3>

<p>The information overload within West Yorkshire Police is shaped by the <span>inherent</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span><em>information-rich</em> and <em>interaction-rich</em> nature of police work, the external requirements placed upon the service, a level of work overload and the distinctive culture of the organization. These factors, in turn, influence the information behaviour of officers and impact on how they use mobile information and communication technologies. The complex, changing police <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and the highly structured and bureaucratic nature of the service creates an overload of information. <span>Nevertheless</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> much of the overload is self-induced, with managers' information behaviour reinforcing and being reinforced by an <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of information anxiety and the organization's culture. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> the fact that some officers do not define information excess as <em>overload</em> (i.e. a problem) cannot help the current <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The use of mobile information and communication technologies was found to result in a minor overall increase in e-mail traffic, although this was not con0ered to be a significant change. The limitations of the device's keyboard and the changing context of its use <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to generate messages that are shorter, less complex and often less formal. The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span><span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of this research, however, is that personal information management is now distributed more evenly <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>day</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> Thus, the technology has enabled officers to 'spread the load' and, in doing so, has helped to ease some of the pressures created by information overload. In other respects, however, mobile technologies have created a paradox: information anxiety can be both lessened and fuelled. Anxiety may be eased by <span>virtue</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of being always connectable, but this may further reinforce the need to be continually contactable. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> anxiety may be increased by the temptation to continually check or answer messages and through the need to clarify the meaning of shorter or ambiguous messages.</p>

<p>Managers' information behaviour and coping <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>were also found to have changed since the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of mobile <span>devices</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> Officers are more likely to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with information received sooner, thereby resulting in less queuing of messages (although filtering <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>still prevail). Approximation (responding in a non-precise way) was also found to have increased. In this particular implementation, the mobile technology has not altered the information-pull behaviour of managers. It is likely that it would, however, were the facility made available. This is inferred from the officers' previously noted desire to have this capability and their general compulsion to seek and amass information. The <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>have had only a <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>impact on other alternative <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of communication. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span><span>reduction</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in paper-based communication was noted by some officers, but the <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>had not perceptibly changed the level of face-to-face <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>within the <span>Force</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

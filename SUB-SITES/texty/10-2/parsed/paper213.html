<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Everyday life information seeking, as described by Savolainen, is a model for understanding how information sources are obtained by the ordinary <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to preserve the coherence in her <em>way of life</em> (<a href="#sav95">Savolainen 1995</a>). Many aspects of everyday life information seeking have been studied subsequently, especially as they relate to health related information seeking (e.g., <a href="joh01html.html">Johnson 2001</a>; <a href="#wik">Wikgren 2001</a>), however, many other aspects remain unexplored. Of particular interest, is the constellation of questions surrounding the purchase of consumer goods; a <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>component of maintaining a <em>way of life</em> for anyone in industrialized societies, such as the United States and Europe. How does information seeking play a role in the shaping of consumer decisions?

<h2>Genetically modified foods as a consumer item</h2>

<p>The use of genetic engineering techniques in the production of agricultural commodities has grown and developed in the past decade. In 2003 it was estimated that 145 million acres worldwide were planted with genetically engineered plants compared with no acreage in 1994, the year that the first genetically engineered 
crop was approved by the US government regulatory agencies (<a href="#pew03b">Pew Initiative...</a> 2003b). In addition, approximately 80% of the processed foods sold in supermarkets are made from genetically engineered crops either through the use of processed oil, such as canola, or from a corn derivative, such as corn syrup 
(<a href="#hal03">Hallman, <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>). Nonetheless, consumer acceptance of this new technology as an appropriate method of producing food for human consumption in the United States is still an open question. Recent surveys have shown that between 33% and 51% of American consumers are <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to these products and would not buy them (<a href="#hal">Hallman <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>; <a 
href="#pew03a">Pew Initiative... 2003a</a>). This percentage has remained fairly consistent despite the fact that most consumers <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>substantive information about what these products are and how they might be harmful or helpful. In a recent <span>survey</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Hallman <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#hal03">2003</a>) found that only 52% of those surveyed knew that genetically engineered food are already in the supermarkets while the Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology poll (<a href="#pew03a">2003</a>) showed that only 34% of their <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>had even heard of genetically modified food. </p>

<p>This <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge seems to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of available information. If information is scarce on the <span>topic</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> the questions are: What is the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information available to the US public? How much is available? and What is the credible content that the many media channels, newspapers, magazines, television, and the Internet are carrying about this important subject? <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>multidisciplinary study undertaken by the Food Policy Institute of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey is examining the information sources that are available for people seeking to learn more. By understanding the nature of information that consumers have been exposed to about this new technology and how they are exposed to it, the study hopes to generate a knowledge base necessary for understanding how consumers form opinions about food biotechnology and how to communicate more effectively with the public about biotechnology-related issues.&nbsp; This project is being conducted by an international team of researchers (<a href="#mci04">McInerney <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>). The Information Access part of the project, conducted by researchers at Rutgers University, first looked at the number of newspaper and magazine stories written in the decade between 1992 and 2002 (<a href="#mci04">McInerney <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>). The project continues to examine other channels for what some authors have called the 'public understanding of science' (<a href="#wyn95">Wynne 1995</a>), including television coverage and the Internet.</p>

<h3>The Internet as a media channel</h3>

<p>As Wilson (<a href="#wil97">1997</a>) noted, the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information being <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>can pose a 
significant barrier to information seeking behaviour. Both the understanding of channels available to everyday life information seekers and the credibility of the information carried there is important to understanding the process that they might use to create knowledge. The <span>characterization</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of what is carried in the many media channels that people are exposed to in their daily lives is a first step in studying what they might know about a <span>topic</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> especially one where opinions are so mixed as in the case of genetically modified foods (<a 
href="#spi01">Spink &amp; Cole 2001</a>). </p>

<p>The present work <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of Internet Websites as sources of information about genetically modified food. The Internet is now an accessible information channel for a majority of Americans; the PEW <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on Internet use in the United States completed in 2002 found that 59% of households in the 
United States have <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>access to the Internet (<a href="#hor03">Horrigan 2003</a>) and there are estimates that 70.4% of the U.S. population uses this <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in some way (<a href="#int04">Internet 
World Stats. 2004</a>). Recent research has shown that people use the Internet extensively to gather information (<a href="#fla01">Flanagin &amp; Metzger 2001</a>), and they are more likely to give credence to the information they find on the Internet than they did in the past (<a href="#joh02">Johnson &amp; Kaye 2002</a>). Johnson &amp; Kaye found that readers using political Websites in the 2000 election found them more believable than during the 1996 election. In this <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>mediated information retrieval, it 
becomes critical to identify <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>sites with substantive information, especially about a <span>controversial</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Assessing the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of an Internet Website is not as easy as it might seem. The question of Website <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>has been defined by different disciplines in three <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the usability of the interface (mediated communication);</li> 
  <li>the information value of the content provided (library and information 
  science); and</li> 
  <li>the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of such a site (information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and technology, media 
  studies). </li>
  </ol>
  
<p>Each definition of <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>leads to lists of criteria about what <span>constitutes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>site. McInerney (<a 
href="#mci00a">2000a</a>) looked at all of these criteria from multiple studies on Web <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to form a 
comprehensive tool for evaluating the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of a Website that would serve to assess its trustworthiness. Her guiding principle was that 'if information can pass a <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> it is most likely to <span>prove</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>trustworthy' (<a 
href="#mci00a">McInerney 2000a: 3</a>) and therefore, have higher credibility. The Website <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Evaluation Tool (WQET) that resulted from the analysis and synthesis of multiple Web <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>studies is an interdisciplinary assessment <span>instrument</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The tool <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>an investment of time and careful con0eration. It takes at least one half-hour to examine a Website thoroughly and apply <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>criteria. This time commitment may be available to information professionals, but the public may not be willing to invest the same amount of time. Thus, the challenge is to devise a method that will lead the Internet user to the same <span>conclusion</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as the WQET without the heavy time investment. Using a different assessment tool to assess the content of diabetes health sites, Seidman looked at <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as one such possible <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>indicator but no <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>correlation was found (<a 
href="#sei03">Seidman 2003</a>). Different results were obtained by Triese, <em>et al.</em> (<a 
href="#tri03">2003</a>) when they compared readers responses to different science Websites. Readers in 
that study rated the .gov sites as being more credible than those from .com sites.</p>

<p>The present study <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to connect other meta-characteristics of a site to the results obtained from using the WQET. There were three guiding research questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of Websites on genetically engineered food available to consumers for everyday life decision-making about this topic? </li>
  <li>Do political con0erations or bias affect the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the Website? </li>
  <li>Does the level of resources, as <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by the update-access interval of the site and commitment to the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>exhibited by the sponsor of a Website, affect the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the site? </li>
  </ol>
  
<p>The model in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>1 shows the conceptual relationship among these questions. The proposed model shows that political <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>combined with the level of resources available to an organization could affect the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information on any given Website. The concepts <em>political attitudes</em> (that is, bias or stance) and <em>resources</em> have been operationalized for the present study by examining several variables. By <em>bias</em> we mean how the Website's sponsor views genetically modified (GM) crops or food and how 
strong the attitude might be regarding the benefits or disadvantages of <span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>genetically modified crops and using genetically modified food. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><em>bias</em> score was assigned to a Website using one of five levels that <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>from 'Very Opposed' to 'Very Favorable' towards genetically modified (GM) food; for example, Friends of the Earth, an environmental organization, is extremely <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to genetically modified food so their Website received a rating of Very Opposed for bias.</p>

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 1</strong>: <span>Conceptual</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>model of factors influencing <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of information.</div><br />

<p>Resource levels were assessed by looking at three different factors: commitment, update-access interval, and meta-tags. The first factor, the amount of commitment that the organization shows towards genetically modified food, was <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by the amount of space on the site devoted to the <span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The second resource factor, site update-access interval, was <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by the <span>length</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of time between the last time the Website was updated and the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>date of the review of the site. The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>resource indicator, the presence of meta-tags, was used for keyword identification of the site's contents. Meta-tags are used in the <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>coding to describe the contents of the site. The rationale behind using these factors is that organizations that care about the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of information on their site will include substantial <span>amounts</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of information, will update their sites regularly to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>new information and will assign keyword meta-tags in order to help information seekers locate information. Overall <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>was <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by the score on the Website <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Evaluation Tool (<a href="#mci00b">McInerney</a>, 
2000b). The <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>model of these variables is shown in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>2.</p>

<p>Working with these models generated four research hypotheses, which were tested using the Website as a unit of analysis. In each case the null hypothesis is that the effect cannot be found. The four hypotheses are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>H1. There is a statistically significant difference in mean <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score between sites that use meta-tags and those that do not use them.</li>

  <li>H3. There is a correlation between bias and <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score.</li> 
  <li>H4. There is a correlation between bias, commitment and update-access interval and the mean <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score.</li>
</ul>
  
<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>The <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>objective of this research is to study the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of Websites that provide information about genetically engineered foods. The first step in this process was to identify the sites using a purposive <span>sampling</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>technique</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The second step was to determine the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score for each identified site using the Website <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Evaluation Tool. Coding was done over a six-month <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by evaluating all the variables related to Web <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as articulated in the Website <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Evaluation Tool and entering the score for each variable into a <span>Microsoft</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Access database built expressly for this project. The database allowed for a total <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score to be calculated from a composite of all the variables, some of which were weighted according to their importance. The resulting data were exported to an SPSS 11.0 spreadsheet for analysis. </p>

<h3>Data sample</h3>

<p>Purposive <span>sampling</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>techniques were used to gather <em>subjects</em>, that is, Websites for the study. The unit of analysis was a Website that had some information about agricultural biotechnology, genetically modified food, genetically engineered food or some variant of these terms. Individual pages about genetically modified food were the focal point of the analysis although the entire Website was analysed. In practice, this meant that information about the last date of update, authority, <span>links</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and graphics were obtained from all of the pages on a Website. Content, authority, and coverage were primarily gleaned only from the most pertinent pages devoted to genetically engineered food.</p>

<p>An initial set of sixty-five Web sites was taken from a <span>checked</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>compiled by a Rutgers University scholar who studied rhetorical <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>used on Websites by proponents and opponents of biotechnology (<a 
href="#qua02">Quaglione 2002</a>). Additional sites were identified using the top three <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>engines as 
rated by Greg Notess's authoritative Search Engine Showdown (<a href="#not03">Notess 2003</a>). At the time of the research in 2003, Notess rated <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google </a>, <a 
href="http://www.wisenut.com/" target="_blank">WiseNut</a>, and <a href="http://www.altavista.com/" target="_blank">Altavista</a> as the top three <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>engines. Three <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>phrases; genetically engineered food, genetically modified food, and genetically engineered crop, had previously been identified as being the most popularly used terms for biotechnology food, and consequently, these phrases were used to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for Websites in the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>engines (<a href="#mci04">McInerney <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>). The top thirty hits on each <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>engine were compared against the already identified <span>list</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Unique items were flagged for review. Some sites were rejected for analysis based on three factors:</p>

<ol>
  <li>lack of meaningful content despite being found by the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>engine,</li> 
  <li>sites that were related to print publications such as a specific article from the publication, FDA Consumer, and</li> 
  <li>Websites that <span>contained</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>only directories of other Websites, such as the British Library's Resource <span>Discovery</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Page on Genetically Modified Foods. (<a href="#USF03">U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2003</a>; <a 
  href="#bri03">British Library 2003</a>). </li>
  </ol>
  
<p>Identified sites were analysed using McInerney's Website <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Evaluation Tool (<a 
href="#mci00b">McInerney</a> 2000b). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score for <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of each site was recorded. In addition to 
the eight different <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>characteristics and the meta-tag score that make up the total <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score, the bias of the site, the amount of space on the site devoted to the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of genetically engineered food, or <em>commitment</em>, and the dates that the Website was accessed and updated were noted. These dates were 
used to determine an update-access interval score for the site.</p>

<p>A single coder was used for the bulk of the project. However, a preliminary <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of a <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>done by the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>coder and the author of the WQET was done and inter-coder reliability was calculated. The results showed a Spearman's rho correlation of only .775 between the two author coders. Since this was below the 
usual .80 standard, further training was done and it was raised to .985. This high reliability between the authors of this paper, one of whom was the developer of the Website <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Evaluation Tool, implied that the best course of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>would be for all sites to be analysed by one of the authors. </p>

<h3>Sampling procedure</h3>

<p>Answers to a series of questions about each Website were recorded on paper forms. (See <a href="#app">
Appendix</a>) <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score for each of eight criteria was determined from these answers by a single coder. After a subtotal was computed by the Access <span>software</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> the presence of meta-tags was noted. Five points were awarded for use of the meta-tag field for keywords that were used responsibly, i.e., were descriptive of the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>content on the site. The rationale for this weighting is based on the care and engagement by the Web staff when they assign meta-tags. In addition, the bias of the site, the amount of space on the site devoted to the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of genetically engineered food, or <em>commitment</em>, and two dates: the date the Website was accessed and the last date the Website was updated, were noted. The results were entered into the Access database. At present, 100 Websites have been completely analysed and form the basis of this paper.</p>

<h3>Assessment of <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>variables</h3>

<p>The <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>dependent variable in the analysis is qualscor, the total <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score, as derived from the Website <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Evaluation Tool. This score is made up of nine different criteria with a rating score of 1-7 based on the presence of various subcriteria. The criteria are content, functionality, authority, currency, <span>links</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> graphics, coverage, <span>style</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and use of meta-tags. The first three criteria:  content, functionality, authority - are weighted by doubling their scores. In this case <em>content</em> <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to the intellectual content of the site, its <span>accuracy</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and clarity; <em>functionality</em> means ease of use and navigation; and <em>authority</em> <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to the credibility of the Website author or organizational sponsor. The weighting of these factors reflects the importance that Website <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>experts assign to the <span>qualities</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#Beck">Beck</a> 1997; <a

&amp; Horton</a> 1999; <a href="#Tillman">Tillman</a> 2003; <a href="#Wehmeyer">Wehmeyer</a> 1997, etc.). The highest possible score for a site is eighty-two with no necessary minimum. <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>3 shows the number of Websites in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that received certain total <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>scores. </p>

<p>Three independent variables were assessed and recorded in the Access database. Bias was <span>judged</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on a five-point scale from 'Very Favorable' (five points) towards genetically engineered foods to 'Very Opposed' to these foods (one point). To aid the analysis an ordinal level, a <span>numerical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>variable was created  from this one and labelled <em>biasnum</em>. <em>Commitment</em> was defined as percentage of the site directory <span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that were devoted to this <span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The amount of commitment to the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of genetically modified food was initially evaluated on a ten-point scale, for example, a site could be scored from 0-10% to 90-100% depending on what proportion of the Website's pages discussed genetically modified food. In order to make <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis easier, the scale was transformed into a <span>numerical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>variable called <em>commit</em>. However, very few sites were found to devote between 40 to 70% of their site space to the <span>topic</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> so the variable was collapsed into three levels: low (0-29% commitment), <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(30-69% commitment), and high (70-100% commitment); the revised variable was labelled <em>commit2</em>. </p>

<p>Two variables were created from the gathered evaluation data: basequal, the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score without the five points for the presence of meta-tags that were <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>after the evaluation; and update-access interval. Update-access interval can also be thought of as a measure of how recently the site has been maintained. Since meta-tag usage was an addition to the total <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score, it was desirable to create a new variable, <em>metapres</em> that could be used in an independent <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>t-test. Rather than an addition to the score, 
<em>metapres</em> was a bimodal, nominal variable created by transforming the cases where five points were <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>into a <em>yes</em> or <em>no</em> for the use of meta-tags on the site. </p>

<p>Table 1 provides an overview of the Website <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that demonstrate Website <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and the number of sites that received specific evaluation ratings. <em>Bias</em> is fairly evenly distributed, although the <em>Very 
Opposed</em> group is the largest. Overall, more Websites demonstrated that the sponsors were either somewhat <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or very <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to genetically modified food (n=46), compared with thirty-eight sites that were somewhat in favour or very favourably inclined towards genetically modified food (n=38). Sixteen of the 
sites demonstrated an even-handed treatment of genetically modified food, demonstrating a position that was neither for nor against. <em>Commitment</em> results were bimodal with only five sites showing a <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>level (30-69% of the site) devoted to the <span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Approximately half of those examined showed a low commitment (n=46), and half had a strong or high commitment to the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on their site (n=49). meta-tag usage was evenly split in the sample; about half the sites used meta-tags (n=54), and half did not (n=46), and their mean <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>
scores were quite close. The mean update-access interval of the sites was over one-half year with a large standard deviation of almost one-year on either 0e of the mean. Ninety-four of the sites were examined for this characteristic because six sites had no dates associated with them. The mean total <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score was 57.2 which would classify the average site as 'Good' on the Website <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Evaluation Tool rating scale.</p>

<h3>Findings and analysis</h3>

<p>This study proposed a model that showed how resources, as <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by meta-tag use, commitment of Website, and update-access interval of the site combined with politics (as <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by bias) would predict the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of a Website. <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>was defined by variables <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on the Website <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Evaluation Tool. Using 
meta-tags for keywords describing a site is one of the indicators of the level of resources in an organization because it implies that the organization has access to a Webmaster with some sophistication and with an interest in <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>information retrieval. It also might <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that the organization cares about getting its message out to Internet users. </p>

<p>Although meta-tags have <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>their ascendancy as a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of evidence for <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>engine relevancy decisions (<a href="#sul02">Sullivan</a> 2002) they are still widely used and may be an indicator of the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the 
Website. The first hypothesis, then, was that an independent <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>t-test would find a significant difference in the mean base <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score of sites (<em>basequal</em>) that used meta-tags and those that did not. The <em>basequal</em> variable was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>specifically to be used in this analysis to capture the other criteria scores without including the five-point reward for using meta-tags. In addition, the <em>metapres</em> variable was used because it was a simple, nominal variable. The results show that, in fact, the means of the two groups of sites, those that use meta-tags and those that do not are almost equal, 55.39 and 53.46 (see Table 1). The equal variances were confirmed by the Levene's <span>Test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>which was shown to have a significant F=.643 at p &lt;.001. With t=.865, p &gt;.05 there is no statistically significant difference between the Websites that used meta-tags and those that did not, and, therefore, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Hypothesis 1, that the use of meta-tags is a good indicator of overall <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of a Website, is not <span>supported</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>A second measure of resource use by an organization is its level of commitment, which in this study was operationalized to the proportion of the Website devoted to the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of genetically engineered food. It was found that Total <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Score did not vary with levels of commitment as had been <span>predicted</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> An analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the three commitment levels (<em>commit2</em>) had mean <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>scores within two points of one another. The results of the analysis showed no support (F (2.97)=1.451, p &gt;.05) for H2, that such a difference would be found in sites that devote quite a bit of their space to genetically modified food and those that have a small section of the site on the <span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The bimodal split of either high or low commitment levels may be a <span>confounding</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>factor in this analysis attributed to the purposive <span>sampling</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>technique</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that was used. Since the Websites analysed had by definition substantive <span>amounts</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of information about biotechnology food, there 
was a high <span>probability</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that these sites would have greater commitment to this <span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> It might also be <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that, as in other <span>contexts</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> quantity does not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>equal <span>quality</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p><em>Bias</em> as a measure of the politics involved in this <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>was also not among a <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>predictor of the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of a Website. Although bias was widely distributed among the Websites (see Table 3 for details), bias did not correlate with the level of <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a Website exhibited. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>simple <span>regression</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis (r =-.111, p &gt;.05) provided evidence that bias had no effect on the total <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score. The null hypothesis for H3 (that strong bias affects quality) <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to be rejected and no support was given to bias as a quick <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>measure as indicated on the model.</p>

<p>The final hypothesis looked at the impact of two of the resource variables (commitment and update-access interval of the site) and bias on the total <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score using a multiple <span>regression</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis. Although bias had been 
rejected as a single predictor of Website <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> a multiple <span>regression</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>might reveal <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>among the variables that would lend support to the total model. This was not the case since only site update-access interval had a significant relationship to the score (beta=-.465, p&#8804;.001 with an adjusted r-squared=0.206). Neither bias nor commitment correlated with the total <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score. H4, that there was a relationship between the resource indicators, commitment and update-access interval and the mean <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score, was partially <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with this evidence although the null hypothesis cannot be completely rejected.</p>

<p>A <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>linear</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>regression analysis confirmed the strength of the correlation of update-access interval and <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and its <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(r= -.474, p &lt;.001 with r-squared=.216). The negative <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of this correlation 
indicates that this factor would predict a lower score on the Website <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Evaluation Tool. In this new single factor model, update-access interval of the site was found to explain 21.6% of the variance. In other words the greater the amount of time between when a Website is updated and when it is viewed by the user, the lower the site's <span>quality</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> In other words how often a Website is updated does <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the lesser <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the site. This suggests that there is still a large amount of the <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in Website <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that remains unexplained.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Websites is an endeavour that occupies many different fields (<a 
href="#sei03">Seidman</a> 2003; <a href="#wik01">Wikgren</a> 2001). The Website <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Evaluation Tool is useful for evaluating the credibility of Websites, however, it can be time consuming, <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>approximately thirty minutes to evaluate each site. Consequently, the tool may be more useful to information professionals rather than to the public at large. Certainly, for sites that will be linked on an organizational portal or a library's Webography, the investment of time in using the tool is worthwhile. Consumers might benefit indirectly if they use library or research centre sites that have been examined and vetted using the criteria in the tool.</p>

<p>It would be valuable to be able to use some meta-characteristic rather than the entire WQET, such as the update-access interval of the site, that might help differentiate Websites that do stand up to the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>test. This study looked for such a distinguishing feature(s). It examined political position as <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by bias and resource use as indicated by space, commitment, meta-tag use, and update-access interval of the site as possible discriminators.</p>

<p>It was determined that bias as a measure of political stance was not a useful discriminator. There was no significant correlation between bias and the WQET score for the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>population. High <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>sites were produced by both proponents and opponents of genetically modified food.</p>

<p>The second possible discriminator, <em>resources</em>, was <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a set of factors. It was thought the level of resources would be indicated by commitment, or the amount of the Website that was devoted to the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of interest, the use of meta-tags, and the access-update interval. It was thought that correlations would exist that would follow the <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>model provided in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>2. However, strong <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>evidence for the model was not found in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of Websites that was analysed. The group of Websites that used meta-tags was equally high in <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as those that did not; the basequal scores were almost <span>identical</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> In addition, <em>commitment</em> was not significantly correlated with the total <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score. Those sites that devoted many pages to the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of genetically modified food fared equally well on the WQET as those that dedicated only a few to the <span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The update-access interval was shown to account for over 20% of the variance in the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>score. This may <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that the amount of updating that a site undergoes overwhelms all other con0erations of resources that an organization commits to an endeavour such as a Web presence on the Internet. However, this result may be <span>complicated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by the number of sites with no <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>determined <em>update</em> date and by those that use automatic dating techniques. Many Websites now pull in the date automatically from their server host. This serves to <span>obscure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>length</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of time since it was last updated. It is especially <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in a science <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>such as genetically modified food to know where current information exists and where outdated research may be. Identifying sites with older information could be critically important for research, for <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> for library <span>purposes</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and for general learning by interested parties. It may be useful to identify and then segregate those sites that do use an automatic dater by looking carefully at the <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>code for javascript-supplied date routines. After differentiating the automatically dated sites from the sites where dates were manually applied, the analysis could then be revised.</p>

<p>As more and more people have access to the Internet and use Websites for gathering information, it becomes necessary to identify high <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and trustworthy sites. The WQET is a useful <span>instrument</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for the information professional to use in accomplishing this important task. For everyday information seekers, however, it examines too many factors. Update-access interval of the site appears to be one <span>valid</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>shorthand criterion for assessing Website <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>despite the many problems with determining the date a Website has been updated. Still, a large proportion of the variance in the scores for Websites remains unexplained.</p>

<p>Because it is common knowledge that information on the Internet <span>differs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>dramatically in quality: some Websites being constructed by <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>who are compelled to do so for a class assignment, others by ideologues with an axe to grind, and others by reputable organizations with a mission to inform or advocate&mdash;it is useful to be able to assess the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information, functionality, and the architectural <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of such sites to find <span>solid</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>information resources in a time effective way. Like traditional efforts to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority in research reports and publishing, knowing how to assess Websites to assist information seekers in particular context areas is an emerging <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for library and information professionals. The Website <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Evaluation Tool was built on aggregate research on information and Web <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> so it provides one step towards understanding Website evaluation. This paper explained how the WQET was used in the context of genetically modified agriculture and food. Current studies are planned to examine content factors more closely in an effort to determine more definitive <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>measures and to look at how users themselves find information on genetically modified foods on the Web and how they incorporate what they find into their <em>way of life</em>.</p>

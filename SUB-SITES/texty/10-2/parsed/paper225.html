<h2>Introduction: a developing <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>for library and information science</h2>

<p>For many years researchers in library and information science have borrowed theory from other fields to provide insight into our research <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>  We are <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>from this borrowed theory approach to creating a conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>that has been tested, refined and adapted specifically for application in our field.  The conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>has developed rapidly during the past ten years with early signs of application in other fields. </p>

<p>An important contribution of the research reported at the ISIC conferences is the development of the user-centred approach.  This research <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>understanding of information seeking and use within the various <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of people's lives.  Important meta-theories, such as Dervin's sense-making (<a href="#Dervin">1983</a>) and models, such as Wilson's model of information seeking (<a href="#Wilson">1999</a>) and the Information Search Process model (<a href="#Kuhlthau1991">Kuhlthau 1991</a>) have been developed in this research area.  New ways of looking at information seeking have emerged, such as Savolainen's (<a href="#Savolainen">1995</a>) work on Everyday Life Information Seeking.  These have substantially contributed to the conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the field and form the basis for <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>research in user studies.

However, transfer of concepts across branches within the field of library and information science remains problematic.  Scholars in different areas of library and information science do not usually talk to each other, attend each other's conferences, read each other's journals or even read each other's articles in the same journal.  <span>Ellis</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span><em>et al.</em> (<a href="#Ellis">1999</a>)found that even within the concentration of information science, scholars do not cite across the three overlapping areas of information <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> user studies and information retrieval.  This unfortunate <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>severely <span>limits</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>our ability to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>users' information problems.  There is a critical need for a broad view of library and information science incorporating concepts of each branch of the field into a unified whole.</p>

<h2>Four imperatives for building the conceptual framework</h2>

<p>The expansive field of library and information science incorporates the great <span>traditions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of librarianship, the insights of user studies, and the innovations of information retrieval and information <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>  The time is right for a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>initiative of collaboration across the branches of the field. I propose four imperatives for fostering collaboration and for continuing to build the conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the field.</p>

<ol>
<li> Stay with a problem long enough to verify <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and draw concepts from the <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span></li>
<li> Apply the broad conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of library and information science to inform the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of our studies.</li>
<li> Develop research projects that incorporate concepts of interest to more than one area of the field.</li>
<li> <span>Design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>application of the concepts for implementation into <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and services.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Stay with a problem to develop concepts</h3>

<p>The first imperative is to stay with a problem long enough to <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and verify the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of an initial study in order to draw concepts from the <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> Sustained research is <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>for developing concepts.  Sustained research involves not only seeing an initial <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>through to completion but staying with a problem to verify <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and to expand understanding of that problem beyond the narrow confines of a single study. Once we are on to something we need to follow up with further <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>applying a variety of methods to exploit the full implications of our research for the field.   When we study information seeking in context it is easy to concentrate on the results specific to that context and to lose sight of <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>concepts that more generally informs physical and intellectual access to information and ideas. </p>

<p>Here is an example from my own research on the information <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>process.  In my first study of <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>school <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>I found that forming a <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in the process of information seeking was the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>task rather than merely gathering information related to a <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#Kuhlthau">Kuhlthau 2004</a>).    <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>student who did not form a focused <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>described great <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>writing and presenting her work.  Here is how she described her dilemma.</p> 

<blockquote>I had a general idea not a specific <span>focus</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> but an idea.  As I was <span>writing</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> I didn't know what my <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>was.  When I was finished, I didn't know what my <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>was.  My teacher says  she doesn't know what my <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>was.  I don't think I ever <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>focus</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>  It was an <span>impossible</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>paper to write.  I would just sit there and say, 'I'm stuck'.  If I learned anything from that paper it is, you have to have a <span>focus</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>  You have to have something to center on.  You can't just have a <span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>  You should have an idea when you start.  I had a <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>but I didn't know what I wanted to do with it.  I figured that when I did my research it would <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in.  But I didn't let it.  I kept saying, 'this is interesting and this is interesting and I'll just smush it altogether'. It didn't work out. (<a href="#Kuhlthau">Kuhlthau 2004: 40</a>).</blockquote> 

<p>Other <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>talked about forming a point of view and gaining a personal <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> From this study I drew the concept of formulation within the constructive process of information seeking.</p>

<p>Later, in longitudinal case studies of information seeking in the workplace, I found further evidence to support the concept (<a href="#Kuhlthau">Kuhlthau 2004</a>).  The securities analyst talked about <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>an <span>angle</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to present to his clients and the lawyers <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>a strategy for presenting a case.  The securities analyst explained the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>problem many novice analysts had in gathering and gathering information but not being able to write the report or as he said 'get out the product'.  Over and over the concept of the constructive process of forming a <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>provided the insight for <span>explaining</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of my users' studies.  Without these <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>studies the work would be interesting but not very useful for contributing to the conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the field.</p>

<p>Sustained, longitudinal research supports collaboration across branches of library and information science by providing confirmed <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>that lead to concepts that can apply in more than one context and 
that more than one area of the field can use for further study and application.</p>

<h3>Apply the conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the field</h3>

<p>The second imperative is to use the concepts developed across the field of library and information science to inform and illuminate the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of our research studies. Once a concept is discovered in one
 context it is important to study that concept in other <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>with different users.  Major concepts in library and information science such as relevance, anomalous state of knowledge, and uncertainty as well as models of information seeking behavior and theoretical frameworks such as sensemaking have been examined in a variety of <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>with different types of users to ground the concept for more general application.  The studies on relevance that build on Saracevic's (<a href="#Saracevic1975">1975</a>, <a href="#Saracevic1996">1996</a>) work are an excellent example.  Taylor's (<a href="#Taylor">1991</a>) levels of information need and information use environments are another.  These concentrations of research not only verify but also extend and develop the concepts for increased understanding and insight that make important <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to the conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of library and information science.</p>

<p>The concept of task complexity, developed by Bystrom and the Tampere team (<a href="#BystromJ">Bystrom and Jarvelin 1995</a>, <a href="#Bystrom">Bystrom 2000</a>, <a href="#Vakkari2001">Vakkari 2001</a>) has provided insight in my own research.  I am often asked if I think that people always experience the stages of the ISP in every information seeking task.  Clearly they do not.  But how to differentiate between tasks was a problem for me. In my recent studies I <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the concept of task complexity and found that workers could <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span><span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>between different types of information use in complex tasks and in routine tasks.  These studies revealed simple straight-forward information seeking in routine work tasks and a process of construction and formulation in those tasks identified by the user as complex (<a href="#Kuhlthau">Kuhlthau 2004</a>). One <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>explained that complex tasks involve a dynamic change in thinking referring to these tasks as, 'the really good ones that you lose sleep over'.  These projects were found to take an <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span><span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of time.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>participant explained, 'Those are the ones that are really time consuming because you are changing your entire thinking on an industry'.   And went on to explain the uncertainty in connection with complex tasks in this way, 'You feel anxiety because you are changing your whole view of the world'.  He described being 'out of my element' and 'treading into new territory' (<a href="#Kuhlthau">Kuhlthau 2004: 170</a>). </p>

<p>The concept <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>an explanation of why people do not experience the information <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>process in every task.  The concept of routine and complex tasks is critical for understanding when to expect users to experience stages in the process.  Applying the conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of library and information science <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>insight into disparate studies and builds the unified whole of the field.  Ingwersen and Jarvelin (<a href="#Ingwersen">forthcoming</a>) are applying the concept of task in their collaborative work in information retrieval.</p>

<p>Information goal is another concept that has helped me to understand different <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to information seeking by individuals with the same or similar task. Limberg (<a href="#Limberg">1997</a>) has developed the concept of the influence of differing information goals.  She found that within the same assignment the goals of fact <span>finding</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> getting a right answer or analysing and synthesizing resulted in quite different outcomes.  Todd's (<a href="#Todd"> 1997</a>) similar <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>developed the companion concept of information intents.</p>

<p>In a longitudinal study of an information worker comparing novice and expert <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to work tasks, I found that the expert had quite different goals in information seeking than the novice (Kuhlthau 2004).  The novice was looking for the right answer.  The expert was seeking to add value to the client's knowledge.  Here is how this expert explains the change in his information goal.  'The task has changed from when I first started.  It is not to buy or sell but to add value.  The best way I can help my more sophisticated client is by adding value to their knowledge base. The young analyst who is not confident in his industry worries about getting the story right.  Now my <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>is on adding value.' (<a href="#Kuhlthau">Kuhlthau 2004: 171</a>).  These information goals result in a very different outcome within the same assignment.  The concept of information goals and tasks are good examples of concepts that are <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>applied to more than one area of library and information science and are emerging as important for developing collaboration across branches of the field.</p>

<h3>Develop collaborative research projects</h3>

<p>The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>imperative is to develop research projects that incorporate more than one area of the field.  Serious problems confronting users in their quest for physical and intellectual access are revealed in user studies.  To address and <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>many of these problems <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span><span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>across branches of the field. Two areas that can benefit substantially from collaboration are user studies and information retrieval.  An important problem emerged in my study of the information <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>process of lawyers that <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the collaboration of these two areas of the field.  These users' experiences and expectations in complex information seeking tasks were not <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>accommodated by the information system available to them.  The problem for these workers was that the <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>available to them did not sufficiently support their process of construction in the information <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>process (<a href="#Kuhlthau">Kuhlthau 2004</a>).  This is how they explained the problem. </p>

<p>First, they described how they go about their work to accomplish their more complex tasks of preparing for <span>trial</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span></p>  

<blockquote>I find that while I am looking for my issue I come across something else, apparently haphazardly.  But it has happened so many times that it <span>isn't</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>haphazard and I usually end up <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the case that way.  I start looking for <span>A+</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> and while looking for <span>A+</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> I find B.  Then <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span><span>isn't</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the issue I am looking for.  Now it's B.  I have found something that really starts to formulate the issue I am looking for.  It has happened so many times that I am convince that there is something else going on here! At first I don't really see what I am looking for and then the next one after it catches my eye and I keep going.  And finally, so far I have never missed, I find the seminal case that turns the key one way or another.  I go in not knowing what the case is, but <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>it.  And once I get there I do the research on it (<a href="#Kuhlthau">Kuhlthau 2004: 180</a>).</blockquote>


<p>Then they stated that they are not confident that the system can support this kind of construction.  One lawyer explained that it was difficult to initiate a complex task with the current system.</p> 

<blockquote>There is something I would miss if I did it the way the system would have you research, which is to plug in the phrase and have it pop up every case that says 'George'.  Well, I can tell you, I have looked for 'George' a lot of times and I have found 'Kevin,' and that's the key.  I would never find it using the traditional <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span><span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>they have now.  So when I do research, I don't usually use the system.  In light of my experience, I go with the book.  I read the case and I  see if any cases <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>that look interesting.  And, <span>ultimately</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> I find what I am looking for.  But I do it in such a way that I would never get there using the <span>computer</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>  And that's why, even today, the system doesn't help me to get where I want to go' (<a href="#Kuhlthau">Kuhlthau 2004: 181</a>). </blockquote>

<p>From the lawyers' <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the system did not allow them to keep track of where they were in an <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>search.  These <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>seemed <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>oriented not task oriented.  As one lawyer pointed out 'There has to be a better way than punching in a keyword and having it spit out every case with that keyword.'  Full discussion of this research on the information <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>process in the workplace is in the second edition of <em>Seeking Meaning</em> (<a href="#Kuhlthau">Kuhlthau 2004</a>).</p>

<p>This important problem <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>collaboration between user studies and information retrieval researchers and could use some help from information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>people as well.  These overlapping areas of information science conduct different streams of research. One stream concentrates on system <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and system use mainly at the point of interface.  The other stream concentrates on the context and experience of information seeking and use.  Both of these <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>address the problem that my lawyers were confronting but neither can <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the problem alone.</p>

<p>Studies that address questions of interest to more than one research area are becoming more common as our library and information science departments become more and more integrated across the branches of the field.  Vakkari's (<a href="#Vakkari2001">2001</a>) <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>studies of the information seeking and use is an excellent example of research that incorporates concepts of interest to information retrieval and user studies researchers.   At Rutgers, the Center for International Scholarship in School Libraries is studying the impact of <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>libraries on student learning.  We have included <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the change in keyword use over the course of the information <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>process in a <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>project. Our colleague Nina Wacholder, a linguist and expert on information <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and organization, is leading this aspect of the study.  Collaborative research of this type <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>opportunities to apply the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to designing <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and services that are tailored to specific needs of users. </p>

<h3>Design application for implementation into practice</h3>

<p>The fourth imperative is to go beyond speculating on implication for practice to developing application for practice.  The concepts that emerge from our research need to be applied for improving library and information services and <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>  Unfortunately much of our information seeking and use research does not go beyond suggesting implications to developing application that have <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>impact on system and service <span>design</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> The work of Fisher and Durrance (<a href="#Fisher">2004</a>) is an excellent example of successful application of concepts <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>from their research to improve library services to meet the specific needs of a wide <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>user groups.</p>

<p>In my own work I have <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to make the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of concepts related to information seeking as a process of construction applicable to the two basic library services of <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and instruction by introducing the idea of a zone of intervention.  The zone of intervention is that area in which an information user can do with advice and assistance what he or she cannot do alone or can do only with great <span>difficulty</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>  Uncertainty indicates a zone of intervention in the information <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>process (<a href="#Kuhlthau">Kuhlthau 2004</a>).  </p>

<p>The model of the stages of information <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>process shows <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>decision points where users find intervention helpful.  By concentrating on these zones, librarians can provide effective and efficient library and information services tailored to users' specific needs.   I found that the participants in my studies wanted help in their information seeking but not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the kind of help that they thought was available.  The securities analyst explained that a serious problem for many people in his <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of work was collecting masses of information but not formulating a focused <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to present in a report for clients.  The student explained that without a <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the paper was <span>impossible</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to write.  The lawyer dreamed of a 'just for me' service that would enable him to construct a complex strategy for a <span>trial</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<h3>Useful concepts for application and collaboration</h3>

<p>Many useful concepts for application into services and <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>are emerging from our research, such as <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>without seeking (<a href="#Erdelez">Erdelez 1997</a>), browsing (<a href="#Rice">Rice <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>), berrypicking (<a href="#Bates">Bates 1989</a>), chaining (<a href="#Ellis">Ellis 1989</a>), monitoring (<a href="#Choo">Choo and Auster 1993</a>), research styles of fast surfing, broad spanning, and deep diving (<a href="#Heinstrom">Heinstrom 2002</a>) to name just a few.  By applying concepts developed in user studies, information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>can be developed that accommodate the user beyond the interface to support seeking information to learn, create, innovate in the context of daily life.</p>

<p>Collaboration between user studies and information retrieval holds promise for designing <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>that address tasks that users are attempting to accomplish.  The task is of utmost importance to the user, not the system in and of itself.  By attending to the query rather than to the inquiry, the system often falls short of enabling the intellectual access <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>for accomplishing more complex tasks.  Collaboration with information retrieval and information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>researchers can open opportunities to apply <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of information seeking and use research in system <span>design</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>Conclusion: the challenge facing library and information science</h2>

<p>We need to develop task-oriented information <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>  We need to take a 'just for me' approach to system <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>that is based on the user's <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of information seeking and use.  We need to prepare the next generation of information users in innovative educational programs that apply concepts <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>from research <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>  I am working on a programme for librarians and teachers of elementary and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>school <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>that I call Guided Inquiry.  Guided Inquiry immerses <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in information seeking as a way of learning and prepares them for the active engagement with information required in all aspects of living and working in the information society.  Guided Inquiry applies many concepts from library and information science research as basic <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>for life long learning.</p>

<p>The challenge facing library and information science today is to bring together the allied areas of the field into an overarching conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>that represents the unified whole.  I have discussed the <span>dynamics</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of collaboration of just two areas of information science.  Con0er the potential of bringing together all of the diverse branches of the field.  Meeting this challenge substantially increases the potential for <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>some of the more pressing problems of physical and intellectual access facing people today.  The question before us is will we do this?  Or will we continue going in our <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>ways missing the <span>golden</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>opportunity before us?</p>

<p>To meet this challenge we need to act on these four imperatives:</p>

<ul><li>Stay with a problem to develop concepts.</li>
<li>Apply conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of library and information science.</li>
<li>Develop collaborative research projects.</li>
<li>Design application for implementation in system <span>design</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span></li></ul>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Traditionally, technology is a male <span>sphere</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> and research has previously shown that boys have a greater interest in technology itself than girls. Girls want to <i>use</i> the technology (e.g., <a href="#dur">Durndell, <em>et al.</em> 1995</a>; <a href="#tur">Turkle 1988</a>). Tapscott (<a href="#tap">1997</a>), on the contrary, says that he cannot see any differences between how boys and girls use the Internet when he studies what he calls the Net generation or N-Gen. N-Geners are people born after 1977. They have grown up in the digital age, and he predicts that when the N-Gen takes over, at least there will be equality between the sexes on the Internet. More recent statistics have shown that, unlike earlier statistics, girls and women are as frequent Internet users as boys and men (<a href="#car">Carlsson &amp; Facht 2002</a>). <span>Jackson</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#jac">2001</a>) got the same result, but in their study women used e-mail more than men did, and men searched the Web more than women did. This cannot be seen in Swedish statistics, where the use of these functions is shared equally between the sexes. An interesting trend in Sweden though is that boys to a greater extent have access to Internet in their homes (<a href="#car">Carlsson &amp; Facht 2002</a>), and it is more common for boys than for girls to have their own <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#sjo">Sj&ouml;berg 2002</a>). Girls' Internet use on the other hand is often highlighted in media in connection with men seeking sexual contact with teenage girls, which increase  parents' worries about the girls' use of the Internet. This shows that the question of equality between the sexes concerning <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>use is very complex.</p>

<p>The results of a <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>competency <span>test</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> which included both theoretical and <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>knowledge (<a href="#bai">Bain, <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>) showed that girls were slightly less competent than boys. <span>Jackson</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><em>et al</em>. (<a href="#jac">2001</a>) found that females reported more <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>anxiety, less <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>self-efficacy, and less favorable and less stereotypical <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>attitudes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> It has also been reported that males show a more positive attitude toward computers than females (<a href="#kad">Kadijevich 2000</a>). It seems that research has found that technology is no longer reserved for males, but that females react somewhat differently to computers, and also have to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>with different conditions in society regarding this issue. The aim of this research is to look at how <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>towards the Internet technology differ between boys and girls, and how this affects the critical approach when seeking information. The research questions are:</p>

<p>How do boys and girls differ in relation to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>interest in technology?</li>
  <li>reflections about Internet technology? and</li>
  <li>reflections about the reliability of the Internet?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Theoretical framework</h3>

<p>The study was conducted within a socio-cultural <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>with a gender <span>perspective</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> The socio-cultural <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>claims that knowledge is constructed and developed through communication with the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>(e.g. <a href="#vyg">Vygotsky 1986</a>). Gender as well as childhood are seen as cultural constructions and the participating <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>are treated as participating subjects and co-constructors of data (<a href="#jam">James &amp; Prout 1997</a>). Concerning the use of the word <em>gender</em>, this means that it is not assumed that there are biological differences in boys' and girls' preferences for technology. These differences are cultural and based on hierarchical structures within the culture of what is <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>for boys and girls <span>respectively</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#joh">Johansson 2000</a>; <a href="#wal">Walkerdine 1997</a>). Science and technology are in no way separated from the cultural structures, which treat women and girls unfairly, as research, e.g., Kember (<a href="#kem">1996</a>) shows.</p>

<p>Clinchy (<a href="#clia">1990</a>, <a href="#clib">1996</a>) points to women's different <em>voice</em> (an <span>expression</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>borrowed from <a href="#gil">Gilligan 1995</a>) regarding critical thinking, which she prefers calling <em>knowing/knowledge</em>. According to Clinchy, Perry  (<a href="#per">1970</a>), who is known for his three phase model of critical thinking, describes a type of knowing that is mostly <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>among males. Clinchy calls this <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>knowing because it manifests itself in distancing from and questioning other <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>s perspectives. Perry  was criticized because of only asking men in his study. Clinchy did similar studies with women and found another way of expressing critical thinking, which was more common among females. She calls this <em>connected knowing</em>. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>dominated by connected knowing tries, in the first place, to understand the other <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>s <span>perspective</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> According to Clinchy, it is important to develop both <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and connected knowing.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>The data used in this article are part of the data material in my doctoral dissertation (<a href="#eno">Enochsson 2001</a>). The aim of the PhD thesis was to understand what young <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>(aged 9 to 11) do when they <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>for information on the Internet at <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and how they <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>on this when they are given the opportunity to work with it for a long <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and with good guidance. Throughout the study the aim was to give the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>on using the Internet. The questions concerned what the Internet could contribute to schoolwork, what <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>used, and differences between searching at <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and searching at home. Questions about reliability and critical scrutiny were <span>emphasized</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> and this was related to the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> models of the Internet system. Differences between boys and girls were analysed. Since it is difficult to <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>this specific gender material from the whole, the <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of the methods also <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>the PhD thesis in general.</p>

<p>The study is an ethnographic case study and was conducted from August 1998 to June 1999 in a class consisting of thirty Swedish fourth graders&mdash;nineteen girls and eleven boys. The class was chosen because of the teacher's aim to use computers as a natural tool in the classroom. Her <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>was inquiry-based, and she tried as much as possible to use the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> questions as starting points in her <span>teaching</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>had an IT profile and was quite well equipped with computers. The material was collected by means of observations, conversations, questionnaires, interviews (both with the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and with the teacher), <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>logs and <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>documents</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> The different data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>methods were used for triangulation of data (<a href="#ham">Hammersley &amp; Atkinson 1995</a>), which is a way of validating: one method's strength can compensate for another method's weakness (<a href="#mer">Merriam 1988</a>). What a student did in the classroom was compared with what s/he said in conversations and chats, and also with the teacher's assessment of the student's ability. All the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and the teacher also read and commented upon their own interviews. The teacher read and commented upon all the results, and the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>discussed some of the results in groups, especially the results of gender difference, which was validated by the young <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>a year after the study. All these activities were done to validate the results of the study, and both the teacher and the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>can be seen as co-researchers in this respect.</p>

<p>The <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>were aware of the purpose of my presence, which was mainly during their <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>work. However, I was also there while they were doing other things in order to get to know them better and to gain cultural competence. The observations were sometimes written down during the lessons and sometimes afterwards. The questionnaires concerned background data like gender, age at present, age when they first used a <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and for what purpose, parents' use of computers in their work and the estimated time they spent at a <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>every week. During one week the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>kept a <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>diary where they noted every time they used the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and what they were doing both in <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and at home. This was compared to a log kept by the <span>school</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Ethnographic studies can make it difficult for informants to know what data the researcher will use, since data also are gathered during small talk. Children's lesser life experience makes it even more difficult for them. This makes heavy demands upon the researcher to be clear. The concept <em>informed consent</em> is <span>complicated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>settings, and David, <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#dav">2001</a>) talk about educated consent, since <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>are taught to do what they are told. Of course, the parents were informed and all the parents had given their permission, but since the <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>were the participants, their opinion must be respected in the first place. On one hand, one of the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>did not want to participate in the individual interviews, but let me watch him in the classroom. On the other hand, one of the boys <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to become <span>famous</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>through my papers. Both caused dilemmas which had to be <span>solved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and they were  <span>solved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>by discussing different <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>together.</p>

<p>The teacher was not studied specifically, but she was interviewed about her intentions with her <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and her actions were of course a part of the field notes. Also the physical <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>was taken into con0eration. The fact that data was analyzed <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>the data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>time could sometimes turn the research in a new <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>as new themes emerged. One of the themes that emerged very clearly was gender differences.</p>

<p>The <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>were made with the help of <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>analyses (<a href="http://www.qsrinternational.com/products/productoverview/N6.htm" target="_blank">
NUD*IST</a>), where all <span>sentences</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>both from interviews and field notes were coded in different ways based on several readings through the material. Some <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>were strictly quantitative and compared data from coded <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>material with questionnaires and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>logs in a database sheet. Others were of <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>nature and based on thorough readings through selected material from the coded texts.</p>

<p>When analysing the data concerning critical thinking, the first time it seemed as if the boys had a far more developed way of reflecting on the Internet's reliability. This was not in <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>with either my or the teacher's impression. In that phase I started to look for other theories and found Clinchy's (<a href="#clia">1990</a>, <a href="#clib">1996</a>), which are described above. When regarding both <em>separate</em> and <em>connected knowing</em> in my analysis, the result was quite different. In the <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of the part of the results regarding reflection on the Internet's reliability con0eration is taken of both to Perry's (<a href="#per">1970</a>) and Clinchy's theories.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<h3>Technology interest and language</h3>

<p>In the class it is obvious that there are girls with a great interest in <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>technology. Two girls and two boys describe themselves as the <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in their <span>families</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>who solves technological problems in connection with <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>use. The girls do not show this at <span>school</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> and no one seems to have noticed it. Nina for example tells me that she usually uses the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>at home for thirty minutes a <span>day</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> which gives her a place among the four most active <span>children</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> She has her own homepage. She made it by using a model from an online club of which she was a member. Nobody in the class seemed to know about this. An extract from the field notes can illustrate Nina's technological competence:</p>

<blockquote>
Nina and Angelica are looking for a special picture for their work. They find the picture but the right mouse button does not work. I <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>them to exchange mice with a <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that is not in use. It turns out that the left mouse button does not work on that mouse. No other mouse is available.<br />
Nina gets an idea and says she will change back to the first mouse. I ask her what she is going to do, but she does not say anything more. She just changes mice. While I am looking at Josefine and Jennie, Nina <span>fixed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>the picture. I asked her how she did it and she tells me that she marked the picture while she used the mouse with the working right button, let it stay that way, changed mice finished her work.  [From field notes.]
</blockquote>

<p>The two boys are used as resources in <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>work. Everybody knows about their <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>competence and the boys make no secret of it. One of the boys shows his homepage to anyone who wants to see it. In this case it is only the boys' <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>competence that is apparent. The girls in the class did not use the computers at <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>as much as the boys did, but the questions about time spent in front of the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>showed no gender differences. Instead of using the computers at <span>school</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> the girls used the family computers to a greater extent.</p>

<p>The boys describe computers and the Internet to a greater extent in more <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>terms than the girls do, which is not the same as reflecting more about it. Even the boys who have not reflected a lot on the Internet system use more technological concepts than the girls do. However, nothing in my observations could be interpreted as showing that boys are better <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>users or problem solvers. The difference was only verbal. </p>

<h4>Reflection 1</h4>

<p>This may be due to the fact that this is the way we are used to seeing it.</p>

<p>The boys' <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>use was more visible in the classroom, since the girls used the family computers to a greater extent. According to Nissen (<a href="#nis">1993</a>) this is not surprising. Males in general tend to use computers more in public than females do. The boys could also <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>their knowledge better verbally. But what does it mean that boys show their knowledge more than girls do? It could mean that adults pay more <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to boys' knowledge and that boys get more opportunities to practice their knowledge about technology in the classroom. This could lead to the boys getting more opportunities to develop their knowledge, while the girls are pushed into the background. The gender <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>will be preserved in this respect.</p>

<p>From a socio-cultural point of view, having a language is necessary for developing knowledge (e.g., <a href="#vyg">Vygotsky 1986</a>). Communicating your thoughts helps to develop them. If the girls' culture does not support developing the specific <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>language, they may lag behind in developing skills in <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>work, since it is more difficult to communicate about it. Examples of this communication problem could be seen.</p>

<p>According to the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves this was because boys and girls have different cultures. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>year after the data gathering phase, when I visited the class to get the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> opinion of my results, they agreed upon the difference, and said that it is more important in boys' culture that their knowledge, especially concerning technology, is visible. Both boys and girls agreed upon this. The fact that it is more important to boys to show their knowledge is not surprising. This is also <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>by many researchers, which claim that in a male culture, hierarchical structures are very important. If you show that you are competent, you can climb higher up in the hierarchy (e.g., <a href="#tan">Tannen 1995</a> and <a href="#tar">Tarullo 1994</a>).</p>

<h3>Students' reflections about the Internet technology</h3>

<p>All <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in the class had a clear picture of the Internet as connected computers all over the world. How the <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>were described varied from 'wires' to <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>technological descriptions. The Internet was described on different levels and this seemed to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> reflections on the Internet system. An analysis of the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> descriptions has been made from models described by Carroll and Olsson (<a href="#carr">1988</a>).</p>

<p>The Internet system can be described as a surrogate, a substitute for something, with the difference that it is better in some respects. An example of this is when the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>describe e-mail as much faster than 'snail mail'. The Internet can also be described as a metaphor. In that case, the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>is on a <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>between the Internet and something else with a similar function, e.g., the telephone or a library. The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>way of describing the Internet is to compare it to a <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>model, which Carroll and Olsson call <em>network representation</em>, is a kind of <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of surrogate and metaphor, but the most characteristic thing about the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>model is the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of making choices at each node in the net.</p>

<p>There are of course other ways of categorizing. Bruce (<a href="#bru">1999</a>) has <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>his material into three different categories of analogy for the Internet. The first category consists of analogies that stress the connectivity and structure, the second are the analogies that stress the information aspects, and the <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>consists of analogies that assign the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of a living organism to the Internet. The metaphors used above cannot really be compared to Bruce's categories, since all categories in this study are descriptions of the structure of the Internet. In contrast to Bruce's study, <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in the present study to a library or a telephone system do not stress the information aspect but rather the structure aspect. In the Ph D thesis (Enochsson <a href="#eno">2001</a>) there are also reflections on the Internet as a living organism. These reflections are analysed in a different way, since they arose in a totally different context.</p>

<p>It seems though that the different models in this study <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> reflections on the structure of the Internet. Half of the boys, but only a <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of the girls <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>model, and as stated earlier, the boys verbalize more knowledge about the technology related to the Internet, although the difference is not statistically significant. An example of this difference is obvious when comparing Nina's (one of the two <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>competent girls) and Tobias' (one of the two <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>competent boys) descriptions:</p>

<blockquote><i>I: Can you describe the Internet?<br />
  Nina: It's fun. You can find things. It's good to have the Internet.
</i></blockquote>

<p>Nina gives examples of what she can find, and I ask her how this is possible.</p>

<blockquote>
N: I guess there are wires. There is something that makes it go from one <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to the other.<br />
I: What can it be?<br />
N: Yes, what can it be...?<br />
I: Does it work like something else you know about, like the telephone or...?<br />
N: I don't know. I guess there's something...<br />
I: Something? But you don't know?<br />
N: No.
</blockquote>

<p>From the interview with Tobias:</p>

<blockquote>
I: What is the Internet?<br />
Tobias: It's a net all over the world which people who are connected can visit, and where you can send  e-mails and contact other people with the same interests and so. And there are different pages where you can find info. and things like that.
</blockquote>

<p>Tobias also gives examples of what he can find and I ask him how it works. He chooses to draw while he explains.</p>

<blockquote>
T: Let's say this is a satellite or something.<br />
I: Yes, you can just put an S or so for the satellite.<br />
T: This is a bit careless... not a very good satellite, but it makes different computers in the world reach each other.<br />

T: Yes. If we say that this [one] wants to send an e-mail. Here's one in Sweden and this is America, and this one writes an e-mail, and it goes <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to the satellite, it's sent from there to Sweden and it's a bit clever, because it doesn't take so long, it just takes a few seconds.<br />
I: Yes, it's clever.<br />
T: And there are also intranets. We have an intranet on this <span>school</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> All the computers are connected in a <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> On these computers there are both intranets and the Internet.

<h4>Reflection 2</h4>

<p>Like the reflections above, the fact that the boys <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>technology verbally in a more developed way than the girls in the class is not surprising. This can be a way of expressing the expectations of the world around them rather than a genuine interest or <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of interest. The boys describe the Internet to a greater extent in more <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>terms than girls do, but even the boys who have not reflected a lot on the Internet system use more technological concepts than girls do. In the two examples from the interviews we can see that Nina, who seems as competent as Tobias in <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>work, does not show the same verbal competence in the field and her model is not as well developed.</p>

<h3>Students' reflections about reliability</h3>

<p>Most of the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>knew that anyone can put a Web page on the Internet. The reasons they <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>as to why people put them there are: to be nice to others, to have fun themselves, to become <span>famous</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> to get in contact with others or to advertise. Reflection on the content has to have a purpose, and there is no point in reflecting just for reflection's own sake. Reflection upon who has put what on the Internet, was closely related to their <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of the reliability of the Internet. What the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>say about the reliability of the Net is reported in three categories, reflecting different levels of reliability. The <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>whose <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>have been placed in category 1 (low) do not <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>very much on the reliability of the Internet. Some of them talk about an idea of censorship. Those in category 2 (moderate) say that you can rely on some things but not on others. In chat rooms you can not rely on who is in the other end, but when you use <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>engines such as  AltaVista you can trust what you find. Finally those who show a more developed reasoning about the <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of what the Internet can offer can be found in category 3 (high). What is good in one respect might be bad in another respect. </p>

<p>Sometimes reliability is a matter of <span>truth</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and lies, but it also means that different standpoints meet. It is important to have knowledge about sources and also about the things you are looking for. This minimizes the risk of being cheated and/or of <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>irrelevant information, according to the <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>When assigning the scores 1, 2, and 3 to the different levels of concepts of reliability, where 3 is the most developed concept, it is possible to <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>the scores with a t-test. The difference between the boys' mean and that of the girls is significant at the 0.05 level. </p>

<p>The levels of the <span>children</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>s concepts of reliability have been related to the models of the Internet described above.  There seems to be an interplay between the different category <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in that those who describe the Internet as a surrogate are those who have not reflected upon its reliability. Those who describe the Internet as a <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>are those who show a reflected reasoning about its reliability. It can also be seen that the overlap is not total, which suggests that development within the two domains can take different routes. (Table 1). Although the <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>over the different cells appears to show a relationship between view of reliability and model of the Internet, this <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>is not statiscically significant. There is clearly a slight tendency towards levels 2 and 3 being associated with the Metaphor and Network models, but a <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>quantitative study would be necessary to validate this.</p>

<p>It is possible to see the two category <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>as describing a hand-in-hand development, where one aspect has an impact on the other. The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>condition</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>for this development is that both aspects are trained. From the case study it is obvious that critical reasoning is not a general talent. Students who are critical in other <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>are evidently not always critical in connection with the Internet. This supports the idea that knowledge is contextual and that it is important to <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and train critical scrutiny in connection with Internet searching.</p>

<p>What can it mean that critical reflection interplays with the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> ideas about the Internet? If boys are allowed to take more time and get more <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to technology because we think they have a greater interest in technology than girls have, it could be that the boys get an advantage and can more <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>develop reasoning about the reliability of the Internet. Will girls lag behind in that development? Having a language also means that it is easier to develop thinking, since you can communicate your thoughts and get feedback. The girls' <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>language reduces their ability to communicate verbally in this matter. As mentioned above, both Nina and Tobias have great interest and skills in handling the <span>computer</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> Nina's place in the <span>table</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>compared to Tobias' shows that the difference in <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>language is something <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>paying <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to.  It is obvious in the <span>table</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that there are more boys in the higher levels, though this is a very small <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The aim of this article is to look at how <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>towards the Internet technology differ between boys and girls, and how this affect the critical approach when seeking information. The research questions are:<br />
How does it differ between boys and girls concerning:</p>

<blockquote>
interest in technology<br />
reflections about the Internet technology and<br />
reflections about the reliability of the Internet?
</blockquote>

<p>The first two questions challenge what previously has been seen as a <i>truth</i> which states that boys are interested in technology itself and girls what to do with it (e.g., <a href="#dur">Durndell <em>et al.</em> 1995</a>; <a href="#tur">Turkle 1988</a>). They also <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>boys' and girls' different ways of talking about the Internet technology. And the <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>question points at a risk in the way traditional gender <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>can be preserved concerning reflection about the Internets reliability.</p>

<p>It is seen in this study that boys <i>show</i> their interest in technology, and that girls do not seem to have the same interest in <i>showing</i> their interest. In that respect this study shows the traditional picture. But  it can also be seen in this study that the girls <em>do</em> have an interest in technology, and do use computers as much as the boys. This latter <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>have certain resemblance to research that claims that boys' and girls' <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>use nowadays are equal (<a href="#car">Carlsson &amp; Facht 2002</a>; <a href="#tap">Tapscott 1997</a>). The <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of interviews and observations over a long <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>discovers incongruence in what the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>say and what they do. On the surface boys are still the technology and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>competent ones, but, in reality, this seems to be changing. There still seem to be barriers for girls to show their competence fully, and for boys to admit that they have very little interest in technology. One of these barriers could be that researchers and/or teachers do not understand that there might be other ways of showing <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>competence than we are used to. Here are girls who are able to <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>their knowledge, and there is also a bigger intra-sex difference among the girls. This could be a sign that things are changing, and that girls are catching up with the boys, but all the girls are not there yet.</p>

<p>Girls who are interested in technology can also have the problem with <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of a language on technology, since such language has a low <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>among girls. If you cannot, or do not want to, talk about what you are doing, it becomes more difficult to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>over what you are doing and to develop more knowledge. An example of this could be seen in the class when the boys were used as resources in <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> and the girls were not, because the teacher did not know about the girls' knowledge. But girls <i>do</i> have a language, and maybe as researchers and teachers we should listen to what they <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>are expressing <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of looking for technology language.</p>

<p>Another important <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in this study is the relationship between the models and reflection on the Internet system and the reflection on the Internet's reliability. According to a socio-cultural <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>it is <span>reasonable</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to believe that different aspects work in a dialectic relationship, and these two aspects develop in <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>with each other. You have to work with the Internet to develop a reflective thinking about its reliability. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>problem that might <span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>is if the boys are allowed to use the computers more than the girls at <span>school</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> and even are encouraged to help their friends to a greater extent than the girls. Will that affect the girls' possibilities to develop a reflective thinking about the Internet?</p>

<p>It is important to be observant of the problems that may <span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in the <span>future</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> so that their effects can be counteracted. Bhagarva, <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#bha">1999</a>) argue that differences between genders in <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>usage can be attributed to gender-biased classroom <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> The teacher, therefore, has an important role on one hand in encouraging <i>all</i> <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in developing a language to communicate with, on the other hand in using computers and the Internet. It is also important to remember that even if it is true that girls in general do not <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>their knowledge in this area to the same extent as boys do, or do not make their use as visible, it is still important to look at every individual.</p>

<p>Since a more developed model of the Internet seems to lead to a more developed critical thinking towards information on the Internet, it is important to help <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to develop models of the Internet. This is also advocated by McFadden (<a href="#mcf">2001</a>) among others.</p>

<p>As mentioned at the <span>beginning</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> although girls and women have caught up with boys and men in time spent on the Internet, there are still differences in how males and females use and <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>about information. Further research has to be done to find out what importance these differences have attaining equality. This study just points at the necessity of looking at the problem from different angels in order to gain improved knowledge and avoid stereotyping.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Search Situation and Transition signifies a way of treating information 
  searching as a process where a period of meta-data interaction (the transition) 
  can be followed by a period of interaction with real data (the situation). The 
  search process switches between interaction in these two data layers and is 
  at the same time influenced by <em>external</em> factors, such as the work 
  task, the searcher, his/her surroundings, and the search tasks generated by 
  the work task. </p>
  
<p>The model is part of the larger Search Situation and Transition method schema which is divided into three 
  parts; a) domain; b) procedure; and c) justification, which is in accordance 
  with Newell's (<a href="#newell">1969</a>) definition. A method schema is a 
  generic model of one or more methods, which contains unspecified components 
  that need to be specified to define a true method (Eloranta, <a href="#eloranta">1979</a>: 
  125).</p>
  
<p>One central category in this model is the work task. In this paper I present 
  the domain of the method schema and, in particular, discuss the influence of 
  work tasks on the interaction process. I use samples from an empirical study 
  to exemplify how it can be used for analysis of information behaviour. I claim 
  that the Search Situation and Transition model is a new model in its way of combining information retrieval and information seeking factors: it applies an holistic perspective on information behaviour. 
  Although the model focuses on Web information search processes, it can also 
  be used for analysis of other modes of searching. </p>
  
<p>The following sections introduce previous research on work tasks; the methods 
  used for developing the method schema; the features of the Search Situation and Transition model; and an 
  empirical study of the effects of work tasks on the search process. The final 
  section is dedicated to discussions and conclusions.<a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> </p>
  
<h2>Previous research</h2>

<p> The work task was identified as a central component in information behaviour 
  by Wilson (<a href="#wilson1">1981</a>), and has been investigated subsequently 
  by Jarvelin (<a href="#jarvelin1">1986</a>), Bystr&ouml;m and J&auml;rvelin (<a href="#bystrom3">1995</a>),  and Vakkari (<a href="#vakkari1">1999</a>). However, it strongly relates to 
  <em>problem</em> or <em>problematic situation</em> (Wersig, <a href="#wersig1">1971</a>), 
  but work task is on a higher level of abstraction; a work task can generate 
  problematic situations. Although not explicitly said to relate to work tasks 
  it is clear that this is a central feature in the process-oriented views of 
  information behaviour advocated by Kuhlthau (<a href="#kuhlthau">1993</a>), 
  Ellis (<a href="#ellis">1989</a>) and Wersig and Windel (<a href="#wersig2">1985</a>).</p>
  
<p>Task orientation in information seeking and retrieval emerged in the 1990s. As explicated by Hansen (<a href="#hansen">1999</a>) and Vakkari (<a href="#vakkari4">2003</a>), there has been a lack of consistency in the literature concerning the use of the term <em>task</em>, which can be used to refer to <em>work task</em> as well as <em>search task</em>. I return to the definition of work task below, for now I define a search task, or information retrieval task (Reid, <a href="#reid">1999</a>) as a specific sub-task of the work task. </p>
  
<p>Bystr&ouml;m's (<a href="#bystrom1">1999</a>; Bystr&ouml;m &amp; J&auml;rvelin's, <a href="#bystrom2">1995</a>; and Bystr&ouml;m &amp; Hansen's <a href="#bystrom3">2002</a>) work on work tasks and how they affect the task performers' choice of information sources and information types is central to the task-oriented viewpoint. Bystr&ouml;m discusses two distinctive ways of handling work tasks; they can be treated from the viewpoint of the searcher, that is, the perceived work task, or as an objective entity, that is, the task as assigned to the searcher (Byström, <a href="#bystrom1">1999</a>).</p>
  
<p>Borlund (Borlund &amp; Ingwersen, <a href="#borlund1">1997</a>; Borlund, <a href="#borlund2">2000</a>) 
has developed a method for evaluating interactive information retrieval in which a central feature is the simulated work task situation, which is a short descriptions of a situation, 'that may lead to information retrieval and seeking' (Borlund, <a href="#borlund2">2000</a>: 80). Her idea is to give test persons such descriptions and then compare the information retrieval sessions by different evaluation measures. She concludes that it is possible to 'substitute real information needs with simulated needs through the application of simulated work task situations' (Borlund, <a href="#borlund2">2000</a>: 140).</p>
  
<p>The earlier studies primarily focused on work task as an element affecting information seeking. Vakkari (<a href="#vakkari1">1999</a>), however, tries to integrate information retrieval and information seeking by focusing on how work tasks affect information types, search strategies and relevance assessments. Xie's (<a href="#xie">2000</a>) focus on micro-level shift of information search strategies within work task-driven information search processes represents a related approach. This is a fruitful way of attacking the integration issue, which has been addressed by many authors from both traditions throughout the last two decades (e.g., Belkin &amp; Vickery, <a href="#belkin1">1986</a>; J&auml;rvelin, <a href="#jarvelin1">1986</a>; Saracevic <em><em>et al.</em></em>, <a href="#saracevic2">1988</a>; Ingwersen, <a href="#ingwersen2">1992</a>; Marchionini, <a href="#marchionini1">1995</a>; Vakkari, <a href="#vakkari1">1999</a>; Spink <em>et al.</em>, <a href="#spink3">2002</a>; J&auml;rvelin &amp; Wilson, <a href="#jarvelin2">2003</a>).</p>

<p>In particular, the integration issue has been a theme of discussion in recent years, which may be related to the evolution of the Web and the rising importance of digital information retrieval in everyday life. Nevertheless, there are very few attempts at modelling the information seeking and retrieval process and how the information seeking factors influence the information retrieval categories, and <em>vice versa</em>, during the process. I believe that the process which accompanies the performance of a work task (<em>work task process</em>) is a fruitful context for viewing information seeking and retrieval processes.</p>
  
<h2>Method</h2>

<p>To develop the model shown in Figure 1 I used a combination of methods. The categories and attributes have been selected based on literature studies and findings from an empirical study of real Web search sessions. Examples of the relevant literature are referred to in the presentation of the model.</p>
  
<p>Figure 1 shows the model's five main categories; the arrows indicate potential 
  interplay between categories during the search process.</p>

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 1: The Search Situation and Transition model </strong></div>

<p>The literature study was followed by a study of real Web users where several 
  methods were used to identify the interplay of different factors during searching. 
  The data were analysed using the qualitative methods proposed by Strauss and 
  Corbin (<a href="#strauss">1990</a>) on three Web search sessions in order to 
  identify additional categories and attributes. This study in particular was 
  fruitful in identifying how search processes can be divided into search situations 
  and transitions. The study subjects were third year students working on their 
  theses in library and information science at Oslo University College. All third 
  year students (a total of 110 persons) were asked to participate, and fifty-five returned 
  a questionnaire on search skills, general search strategies, work tasks, and 
  demographic data. In all, thirteen students volunteered to participate in our study, 
  agreeing to have Web search activities related to their theses recorded and 
  observed. This resulted in nine (successfully recorded) search sessions, which 
  in total lasted twelve and a half hours. Data from the study were used a) for developing the 
  conceptual model; and b) for an analysis of empirical research questions on 
  the interplay of different factors (categories and attributes) during Web searching, 
  to test the Search Situation and Transition method schema's applicability to analysis. Findings from the 
  empirical study are presented below.</p>
  
<h2>The categories of the Search Situation and Transition <em>model</em></h2>

<p>In this section the five categories of the Search Situation and Transition method schema domain and a selection of their attributes are presented. The list of attributes is not fixed, since, when developing a specific method based on the schema the researcher should pick attributes relevant to the research problem (Pharo, <a href="#pharo1">2002</a>). I choose to emphasise the search situation and transition categories and only give brief introductions to the other categories.</p>
  
<h3>Work task</h3>

<p>Important attributes of a work task include goal, complexity, size, and stage.</p>

<ul>
<li>The purpose or <em>goal </em>of the work task is what is intended to be its 
  final result as perceived by the task executors. The goal may be vague at the 
  start of the work task process and be sharpened as the process progresses.</li>
  
<li>Work task <em>complexity</em> is used to describe the combination of the dimensionality 
  of the task; its variety of dimensions; predictability of task performance and 
  the number of sub-tasks involved Task complexity is individually perceived and 
  depends on the searcher's task knowledge. Bystr&ouml;m (<a href="#bystrom1">1999</a>) 
  has investigated how task complexity affected searchers' needs and choice of 
  different information types and sources. Thus, it seems plausible to hypothesise 
  that only tasks of a certain complexity trigger the use of databases and other 
  complex information search systems.</li>
  
<li>The <em>size</em> of the work task can be measured in terms of the number of 
  working hours assigned to it.</li>
</ul>
  
<p>The information seeking process proposed by Kuhlthau (<a href="#kuhlthau">1993</a>) 
  and by Ellis's (<a href="#ellis">1989</a>) categories, as well as the problem 
  treatment process of Wersig and Windel (<a href="#wersig2">1985</a>), all focus 
  on different work task <em>stages</em> that influence people's behaviour towards 
  problem solving. A recent study (<a href="#wilson3">Wilson <em>et al.</em>, 2002</a>) 
  suggests that Kuhlthau's information search process should be seen as independent 
  of the problem solving (or <em>task performing</em>) process. Each stage in 
  the problem solving model (Wilson, <a href="#wilson2">1999</a>) could lead to 
  an information seeking process going through all the stages suggested by Kuhlthau.</p>
  
<h3>The searcher</h3>

<p>The searcher is the person who interacts with the systems. More than one searcher 
  may be involved in a search process, although usually only one of them performs 
  the actual actions. The following eight attributes of the searcher are of special 
  significance: work task knowledge, search knowledge, search system knowledge, 
  education, motivation, tenacity, uncertainty, and attention. </p>
  
<ul>
<li><em>Work task knowledge</em> is used to denote the searcher's pre-knowledge 
  and prejudices concerning the task(s) he tries to perform <em>with the aid of 
  information obtained through interaction with the system.</em> Such knowledge 
  is the result of the searcher's previous performance of similar tasks, his work 
  with current tasks, as well as knowledge acquired from reading about relevant 
  topics and discussing it with others. </li>
  
<li><em>Search knowledge</em> covers the searcher's knowledge in searching information 
  systems, including the use of query language operators, being aware of synonyms, 
  knowing about the implications of searching in specific fields versus free-text 
  searching etc. A variety of studies exists of the way search expertise influences 
  search execution in different kinds of information systems (e.g.,Ingwersen, 
  <a href="#ingwersen1">1982</a>; Marchionini, Lin &amp; Dwiggins, <a href="#marchionini2">1990</a>; 
  H&ouml;lscher &amp; Strube, <a href="#holscher">2000</a>). </li>
  
<li>The searcher's <em>search system knowledge</em> is specific for the system 
  in use and has to do with the searcher's knowledge in using the particular software 
  developed for the individual system.</li>

  <li>The searcher's <em>education</em> has been treated as a factor in many studies 
  (e.g., Ellis, <a href="#ellis">1989</a>).</li>
  
<li><em>Motivation</em> refers to the searcher being influenced to engage in interaction 
  generated by the results presented to the searcher by the search system.</li>
  
<li><em>Tenacity</em> is used to describe the searcher's inclination to invest 
  time and effort in <em>impossible</em> or very repetitive and boring tasks. 
  This attribute is particularly important when an episode of interaction takes 
  a long time and it <em>prevents</em> the searcher from interrupting the interaction. </li>
  
<li>Kuhlthau (e.g., <a href="#kuhlthau">1993</a>) focuses on how <em>uncertainty</em> 
  is related to different stages in the search process, but instances of uncertainty 
  appear during information searching, and the concept can be used to focus on 
  the micro-level to see how instances of uncertainty influence the search process.</li>
  
<li>The searcher's <em>attention</em> is used to describe his ability to notice 
  useful information as it appears during the search process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other factors are also often used to characterise searchers, for example background, 
  age, gender, cognitive style, experience etc.</p>
  
<h3>Social and organizational environment</h3>

<p>This category is emphasised in many models of information retrieval and seeking as an important part of 
  the searcher's surroundings, in the sense that the searcher constructs his understanding 
  of a (work) task through interaction with his surroundings. Discourse analysts 
  (e.g., Frohmann, <a href="#frohmann">1994</a>) focus on how specific institutions 
  give meaning to the core elements discussed within a field or an organization.</p>
  
<p>Previous research (e.g., Rasmussen, <a href="#rasmussen">1990</a>; Ingwersen, 
  <a href="#ingwersen2">1992</a>; Hjørland &amp; Albrechtsen, <a href="#Hj&oslash;rland">1995</a>) 
  has pointed to the influence of the environment's <em>domain</em> on information 
  behaviour. </p>
  
<p>The <em>actors</em> refer to the persons involved in the searcher's social 
  and/or organizational environment including colleagues at work, members of an 
  organization, friends, or others that in some way may be involved in surroundings 
  that have an interest in what the searcher does.</p>
  
<p>The goals and <em>strategies</em> of the environment/organization refer to 
  its reasons for existence. Organizations have their own etiquette as to how 
  tasks should be solved. Audunson claims that such 'norms, rules, and structures' 
  explain why 'decision makers often gather information without using it' 
  (Audunson, <a href="#audunson">1999</a>: 526).</p>
  
<h3>Search task </h3>

<p>The search task can be characterised by its goal, its complexity, and the search 
  strategies used to execute it. Reid (<a href="#reid">1999</a>) suggests that 
  'IR tasks' should be the focus of a new paradigm for information retrieval. 
  A search task, in some instances, can be identical to the work task, for example 
  for an intermediary whose work task is to perform a search for a client and 
  submit the result in a printout, a list of references, or other form. </p>
  
<p>The search task <em>goal</em> is what is intended to be its final result i.e., 
  what information, documents, facts, etc. the searcher understands to be desired. 
  The search task's goal (like the work task's) may be vague at the start of a 
  search and may be sharpened through interaction with the system.  J&auml;rvelin points 
  out that the search task goal may be to collect problem (task) information, 
  domain information, or problem (task)-solving information (J&auml;rvelin, <a href="#jarvelin1">1986</a>; 
  Bystr&ouml;m &amp; J&auml;rvelin, <a href="#bystrom3">1995</a>). </p>
  
<p>The <em>complexity</em> of the search task refers to its multidimensionality; 
  i.e., the variety of sub-tasks within the search process, but also to the predictability 
  of task performance and the number of search sub-tasks involved (similar to 
  work task complexity). </p>
  
<p>Search task <em>strategies</em> constitute the searcher's plan for executing 
  the search task. Search task strategies may include specification of which sources 
  to use and the techniques that should be used in order to explore them. The 
  strategies may also state in what order sources and queries should 
  be explored and executed. </p>
  
<h3>The search process</h3>

<p> While observing the search sessions referred to above the idea of search situations and transitions came up. One interesting phenomenon was the time and effort spent by searchers scanning subject directories, tables-of-content, hot-lists and other collections of links. This, in addition to the time and effort they spent using various kinds of databases and search engines, pointed out to me that it might be worthwhile to view the sessions, or search <em>processes</em>, as consisting of alternations between searchers interacting with meta-level resources and their interaction with <em>real</em> information resources. This conceptualisation is not specific to Web interaction or, indeed, interaction with electronic information resources. The searcher approaching a traditional public library also engages in these two kinds of interaction; while examining the library bibliographic (card) catalogue she clearly interacts with meta-data, but when she has picked out a book or a journal and started reading it she interacts with <em>pure</em> information.</p>
  
<p>A search process is defined as a series of transitions and situations and switches between them, following the three basic rules: </p>

<ol>
  <li>a search process always starts with a transition</li>
  <li>a transition may be followed by a transition or a situation</li>
  <li>a situation is followed by a transition or by the end of the process</li>
</ol>

<p>Search <em>situations</em> are the periods during a search process when the 
  searcher examines a resource in order to find information that may be of help 
  to execute his work task. Situations may take place in the same kind of resources 
  as transitions, depending on the search task; if the searcher wants to learn 
  more about the structuring of subject indices it would be natural to examine 
  such resource types for that purpose.</p>
  
<p>Search <em>transitions</em> are executed to find resources which the searcher 
  believes may have information that can help him execute his search-task. The 
  transitions consist of source selection and inter-source navigation. One can 
  also say that the transitions deal with <em>meta</em>-information.</p>
  
<p>The main difference between situations and transitions is that during transitions 
  the searcher interacts with information surrogates with the intention of finding 
  resources. Thus a transition can be compared to an information-seeking strategy 
   (Belkin, <em>et al.</em>, <a href="#belkin1">1993</a>) performed 
  in a meta-information resource. As the searcher has no contact with potentially 
  task-solving resources during transitions, no direct relevance judgements can 
  be made. Of course, the searcher will decide which links to follow or reject 
  in a query result list or a subject index, but as soon as a link is selected 
  a situation starts. Thus, all relevance judgements during transitions are based 
  on surrogates and lots of rejections take place <em>silently</em>.</p>
  
<h3>Attributes of situations and transitions<a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></h3>

<p>Search situations and transitions have many attributes in the model (Figure 1). The attributes relate to the process directly and to the external factors (e.g., searcher's motivation and knowledge) as discussed below.</p>
  
<p><em>Action</em> is used to describe the moves (Fidel, <a href="#fidel">1985</a>) made by the searcher during a situation. In Web interaction this would be the following of links, entering of queries, or scanning of pages. It is possible to identify certain entering or leaving actions when analysing search transitions: such action would also signify the start or end of the next transition or situation.</p>
  
<p>The <em>accumulated results </em>refer to the information already found. This includes information found in previous situations as well as in the current one. The search process is characterised by the searcher constantly stacking (usable and useless) results into a pile and choosing to use (or not to use) whatever is in that pile in the current transition. Accumulated results relate to the completion of the information need (or the futility of trying that). It may also refer to results accumulated during preceding search sessions and through other sub-tasks, i.e.,sub-tasks not involving information searching.</p>
  
<p>The <em>accumulated efforts </em>refer to how much work the searcher totally has had to invest from the start of the present session (or in prior sessions) up to the current position. In addition it can refer specifically to effort invested in the current situation.</p>
  
<p>The <em>information space</em> refers to the part of the information system that the searcher has navigated, as well as the information space anticipated by the searcher. The searcher has developed a cognitive model of the information space based on his knowledge about the system, but also on his knowledge about resources that he expects to be represented in the system. On the Web this might be different institutions' Web sites, or the databases and functionalities available from a database provider or the document types available in a database.</p>
  
<p><em>Time</em> can be used to specify how the total amount of time spent during a search process influences the current situation, but it can also relate to  the specific time used in that situation.</p>
  
<p>The <em>remaining needs</em> refer to what the searcher has planned to search for in the continuation of the session process and possibly in subsequent search processes.</p>
  
<p>There are many <em>resource types </em>available in the Web, which differ from 
  each other with respect to content and format. Some are known from the world 
  of paper-based publishing, such as newspapers, scientific journals, dissertations, 
  novels, and collections of poems, but there are many new genres of Web origin 
  such as home pages, various kinds of interactive resources, etc. (Shepherd &amp; 
  Watters, <a href="#shepherd">1998</a>). Other information systems may also offer 
  a selection of different resource types, e.g., full-text or abstracted versions 
  of journal articles or conference proceedings, bibliographic records, citation 
  records etc.</p>
  
<p> <em>Technical problems</em> refer to problems caused by the software in use, 
  both on the client and server sides of interaction. Lack of bandwidth may also 
  cause problems, for example in accessing resources that heavily depend on transmission 
  of large amounts of data. Web pages that have disappeared also exemplify this 
  kind of problem. </p>
  
<p>Situations and transitions share many attributes. Two unique attributes are 
  only present in situations: relevance judgement and relevance level.</p>
  
<p><em>Relevance judgement</em> relates to the searcher's evaluation of the resources 
  found, which may be of use to him in different degrees. Relevance can be measured 
  using binary or ternary relevance measures (Spink, et al<em>.</em>, <a href="#spink2">1998</a>). 
  (See, for example, Borlund (<a href="#borlund1">2000</a>: 35-37) for an examination 
  of degrees of relevance.) </p>
  
<p>By <em>relevance level</em> is meant that the criteria used for evaluation 
  may be related to the work task, which is what Saracevic (<a href="#saracevic1">1996</a>) 
  calls situational relevance, but they can also be related to other levels, e.g., 
  when an intermediary judges relevance for a (potential) user. Relevance judgements 
  are also taken in accordance with organizational preferences; thus socio-cognitive 
  relevance (Cosijn &amp; Ingwersen, <a href="#cosijn">2000</a>) may also affect 
  the judgements.</p>
  
<p>These attributes are not the only ones characterising the search process, but 
  during the study these stood out. </p>
  
<h3>The effects of work task on search processes</h3>

<p>As part of the empirical study to test the applicability of the Search Situation and Transition method 
  schema, i.e., <em>not</em> to get precise answers concerning the relationships 
  on a general level, I performed an analysis of a series of research question. 
  In this chapter I shall focus on one of these:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>How do work task goals influence Web information search processes?</li>
</ul>

<p>A set of techniques for data collection and analysis has been proposed in the 
  method schema's <em>procedure</em> (Pharo &amp; J&auml;rvelin, <a href="#pharo2">2004</a>). 
  The data collection techniques are well known from general literature on research 
  methods so these will not be discussed in much detail. The most important difference 
  between previous approaches and the Search Situation and Transition approach is the latter's systematic 
  use of triangulation as a general approach, i.e., to combine different data 
  collection techniques in order to get as rich a picture of the information searching 
  process and related categories as possible. Another important feature is its 
  level of granularity: not too fine-grained (individual moves), not too coarse 
  (whole sections).</p>
  
<p>The nine real-life Web search sessions performed by thirteen students (some 
  worked as pairs), which were presented in Section 3 above, were analysed to 
  answer the research question. I have used the following data:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li><em>Questionnaires</em> answered by students working on theses for the bachelor 
    degree in library and information science. The data were used to learn about 
    searchers' work-task knowledge, search knowledge, search system knowledge,
    education, the work-task goal and actors in their environment;</li>
	
  <li><em>Interviews</em> with the searchers before and after search sessions. 
    The sessions are driven by search-task goals which are defined by the searchers 
    and which are related to their theses. The data gathered from these interviews 
    were used to learn about different attributes of the work task and search 
    task;</li>
	
  <li><em>Observation notes</em> made during each of the sessions. The data were 
    used partly in a pilot study where a sub-set of the sessions was used for 
    the initial categorisation of the search process attributes. Partly, these 
    data have also been used as a supplement to the video recordings of the sessions;</li>
	
  <li><em>Video recordings</em> of each of the sessions. The recordings were transcribed 
    and used to document the search processes, the transcription focused on actions 
    that took place, resources used, and utterances made by the searchers. The 
    data were used to identify attributes of the search process, as well as attributes 
    related to the other four categories;</li>
	
  <li>The <em>final theses</em>. These were used to collect additional data about 
    the work task.</li>
</ul>

<p> The collected data were interpreted by triangulating the video recordings 
  with the additional data sources, and then presented as session <em>stories, 
  </em>an example of which is shown in Excerpt 1 below. A very important feature 
  of the data is that the search sessions are very long and the searchers well 
  motivated. Therefore, they represent good examples of how people actually search, 
  and the kind of effects the context and external categories have on the process.</p>
  
<div style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small; font-weight: bold; margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; text-align: justify;">In situation 91_S10 the resource contains a presentation of a novel 
  (resource type) by Gaarder called <em>I et speil i en g&aring;te</em>. Gaarder's 
  publisher Aschehoug has made this page, which is bookmarked, but not included 
  in the final resource (relevance judgement). The situation lasts only 13 seconds 
  (time) when the searcher backtracks to the query results list (relevance level 
  &lt;--WT goal).<br /><br />
  <em>It is clear from examining the final resource that different criteria have 
  been used when the students have chosen which pages they think are relevant 
  for the individual authors (accumulated results --&gt; WT knowledge + --&gt; 
  WT goal --&gt; relevance level --&gt; relevance judgement). One possible reason 
  for this is the amount of information available on the individual authors. The 
  case of Fangen and Gaarder is a good example. Gaarder is a contemporary author 
  who has received much attention internationally, and a phrase query on his name 
  in FAST December 2000 receives 5288 hits. A similar query on Ronald Fangen returns 
  only 111 hits. Thus, it seem likely that the searcher would expect to find more 
  information on Gaarder than Fangen and adjust her relevance criteria according 
  to these expectations.</em></div>
  
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Excerpt 1. Searcher exploring a publisher's site</strong></div>

<p>In the interpretation part of the story (in italics), which relates to a larger 
  context than space allows, we get an impression of the importance of the work-task 
  goal for the establishment of relevance level for evaluating the resources that 
  the searcher deals with. Here the accumulated results, i.e., what the searcher 
  has already found on Gaarder ('lots of resources') influence the searcher's 
  work task knowledge ('it is a lot about him'), which in turn makes 
  her adjust her work task goal (from 'include everything' to 'include 
  limited amount of data on author') leading to sharpened level of relevance 
  ('only include resources dealing with...' for deeming a resource relevant.</p>
  
<p>In total, 283 situations and 369 transitions were analysed. On a general level, the goals of all the students were to complete their theses. To find out when the work-task goals directly influence the Web information search process<a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>  I identified traces of work-task goals in all nine session stories. </p>

</table>

<p>Table 1 presents the identified effect of work task goals on three different 
  attributes (<em>remaining needs</em> during search transitions and <em>relevance judgements</em> 
  and <em>relevance level</em> during search situations). </p>
  
<p>Clearly the goal of the work task directly influences the relevance level used 
  by our searchers when they evaluate resources. The sessions where this influence 
  is most apparent are all generated by the same work task, which was to develop 
  a Web resource on a predefined set of authors targeted at high school students 
  writing their theses. These particular sessions (S3, S4, S5, S6, and S8) also 
  have similar search tasks, that is, to collect information on authors to include 
  in the resource. The work task thus makes the searchers evaluate the information 
  found according to criteria other than if they had needed the information for 
  literary analysis or biographic storytelling. The criteria used by the searchers 
  reflect that their relevance level is <em>topical</em> (Saracevic, <a href="#saracevic1">1996</a>). 
  That is, the searchers are only interested in finding out whether the retrieved 
  Web page contains <em>something</em>, such as an interview or a book review, 
  about the author on their list. They do not analyse the contents of the page 
  any further, but leave this to the <em>end-users</em>; thus, the searchers 
  take the intermediary role when evaluating documents representing authors in 
  these five sessions.</p>
  
<p>One reason why it is difficult to identify the influence of work-task goals 
  on relevance level in the other sessions may be because it is taken for granted 
  that the relevance level is what Saracevic (<a href="#saracevic1">1996</a>) 
  calls <em>situational</em> relevance. By this is meant that searchers judge 
  potential information by its usefulness in reducing uncertainty. This is not 
  the case in these five sessions, where the relevance level was <em>topical</em>, 
  meaning that the searchers examined whether the resources were about the author 
  without relating them to any specific problem. It is easier to spot what was 
  not predicted in the data, and in this case it was predicted that situational 
  relevance would be the searchers' default relevance level.</p>
  
<p>On the other hand we hypothesise that the possible users of the resource, i.e., 
  the high school students, will evaluate whether the potential information in 
  the Web site is <em>cognitively</em><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> (Saracevic, <a href="#saracevic1">1996</a>)  or situationally relevant.</p>
  
<p>It could be argued that in the particular cases referred to above, that is, searchers 
  taking the intermediary role, it would be sufficient to use the <em>search-</em>task 
  goal to perform the relevance judgement. While in cases where the searchers 
  search information in order to satisfy their situational needs they evoke the 
  work-task goal in order to decide whether the retrieved pages can be of use 
  to them. This suggests the following hypotheses for future testing: </p>
  
<ol>
  <li> Search-task goal can be used to perform relevance judgements on the topical 
    level;</li>
  <li>Work-task goal can be used to perform relevance judgements on the cognitive 
    level;</li>
  <li>Work-task goal can be used to perform relevance judgements on the situational 
    level.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the analysed data there are also examples of how searchers change parts of their work-task goal as the result of lack of relevant sources. An example is the searcher who decides not to include a certain page on a certain author (the work task being to make a collection of Web resources on authors A-Z), although she has collected similar pages to represent other authors. Thus, the accumulated results will influence the searcher's knowledge of the task, which may make him adjust his work task goal and in turn use new relevance criteria. This example of how work tasks are dynamic, influencing the relevance judgements as well as the direction of the Web information search process as a result of the retrieved documents, supports claims often made by theorists on information behaviour (e.g., Ingwersen, <a href="#ingwersen3">1996</a>; Vakkari, <a href="#vakkari3">2001</a>).</p>

<p>Findings from the empirical study also indicates that the work task goal indirectly 
  influences the time (and effort) invested in examining resources, when judging 
  their relevance during the process. In addition the actions performed in order 
  to inspect the page are also influenced. Searchers may, for example, choose 
  to invest the time in examining as many resources as possible rather than thoroughly 
  looking into the individual resource.</p>
  
<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>This article has presented a methodical tool for analysing information behaviour 
  which takes into account factors traditionally dealt with from an information 
  retrieval (e.g., actions performed in the search process) or information seeking 
  (e.g., work task) perspective. I have focused on the domain of the Search Situation and Transition method 
  schema to illustrate the conceptual model behind the tool. In addition, the 
  article includes extracts from an empirical study which shows that it is possible 
  to use the method schema to identify effects of work tasks on real search processes.</p>
  
<p>Most researchers who have tried to develop general models that attempt to conceptualise 
  both information seeking and searching and retrieval have had their point of 
  departure in the information seeking tradition (e.g., Wilson &amp; Walsh, <a href="#wilson4">1996</a>). 
  The present work goes further by integrating characteristics of the searcher, 
  his surroundings, the work task, the search task, and the interaction process 
  between searcher and search system. Seldom have characteristics of the actual 
  searcher-system interaction been coupled with categories such as the searcher's 
  work task. However, in a recent study Vakkari has, among other things, found 
  that work-task stages influence the number of query terms used as well as the 
  search tactics used in different stages (Vakkari, <a href="#vakkari2">2000</a>). 
  Similarly Spink and others have in a series of articles analysed mediated information retrieval 
  (<em>search episodes</em>) during information seeking processes, among interesting 
  findings there are indications that searchers often experience shifts in the 
  problem solving stages during and between successive searches (Spink <em>et al.</em>, 
  <a href="#spink3">2002</a>: 723). They have, however, not yet published a conceptual 
  model.</p>
  
<p>I believe that to combine the efforts from both traditions dealing with information 
  behaviour is a necessary step forward for our research area. Using people's 
  work task as a point of departure for understanding what generates their searching 
  will often be fruitful, and the Search Situation and Transition method schema can be used for that purpose. 
  It will be useful to learn more about the context of people's actual interaction 
  with information systems for several reasons. Therefore, the isolated attempts 
  at attacking the problems from one tradition or the other should be reduced 
  in favour of research that combines seeking and searching issues.</p>
  
<h2>Notes</h2>

<p><a name="footnote1"></a>1 The article can be supplemented by another paper (Pharo 
  &amp; J&auml;rvelin, <a href="#pharo2">2004</a>) focusing on the methodical aspects 
  of the Search Situation and Transition method schema. For a more thorough presentation my 2002 dissertation  is available on the Web (Pharo, <a href="#pharo1">2002</a>).</p>

<p><a name="footnote2"></a>2 Search situations share many characteristics with search 
  transitions, therefore, unless otherwise stated, the reader should read the 
  term situation as <em>situation and transition</em></p>
  
<p><a name="footnote3"></a>3 In many cases the work task goal will only indirectly influence 
  the searching, via its core role during the formulation of the search task goal(s).</p>
  
<p><a name="footnote4"></a>4 Cognitive relevance, or pertinence, is used by Saracevic 
  to express, 'the relation between the state of knowledge and cognitive information 
  need of a user, and texts retrieved'. At this level there is, however, 
  no attempt at evaluating the relationship between the searcher's work task and 
  the retrieved documents.</p>

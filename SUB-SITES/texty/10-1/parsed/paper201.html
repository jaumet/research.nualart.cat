<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>It is an almost <span>universal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in studies investigating human information behaviour that people choose other people as their preferred <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of information. Studies of academic researchers in both the sciences and the humanities have revealed the importance of consulting with colleagues at different stages of their research (<a href="#ellis">Ellis</a>, 1993; <a href="#case1991">Case</a>, 1991). Professionals, such as engineers, nurses, physicians and dentists rely on co-workers and knowledgeable colleagues in their <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for work-related information (<a href="#leckie">Leckie, <em>et al.</em></a>, 1996). Personal sources are also among the most important sources consulted by chief executive officers during their environmental scanning (<a href="#choo">Choo</a>, 1993). Studies of ordinary citizens' preferred sources of information also confirm the importance of personal contacts in information seeking behaviour (<a  href="#warner">Warner, <em>et al.</em></a>, 1973; <a href="#chen">Chen &amp; Hernon</a>, 1982). The poor, as well, prefer interpersonal sources over other sources of information (<a href="#dervin1972">Dervin &amp; Greenberg</a>, 1972; <a href="#childers">Childers</a>, 1975; <a href="#spink">Spink &amp; Cole</a>, 2001 <a href="#sligo">Sligo &amp; Jameson</a>, 2001; <a href="#agada">Agada</a>, 1999; <a href="#chatman">Chatman</a>, 1996).</p>
  
<p>The explanation for the use of people as information sources has often been that they are 'typically easier and more readily accessible than the most authoritative printed sources' (<a href="#case2002">Case</a>, 2002: 142). The use of people is a <em>least effort</em> option in the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for information and, therefore, may not be the best sources available (<a href="#childers">Childers</a>, 1975; <a  href="#dervin1983">Dervin</a>, 1983). The theory of social capital, however, suggests that the use of people as information sources is not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>an easy option, but may also <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>effort. This paper looks specifically at the use of personal sources of information and how factors related to social capital, including the strength of the relationship between information seeker and information <span>source</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and the resources possessed by the information  <span>source</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> affect who the information seeker chooses to consult. The conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for this analysis is Lin's (<a href="#lin2001a">2001a</a>) <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>theory of social capital.</p>
  
<h2>The <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>theory of social capital and information seeking behaviour</h2>

<p>The <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>theory of social capital is rooted in the concepts of social <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis which provides a series of methodological <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the relationships, or ties, between individuals. The <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of relationships comprises the social <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The theory as proposed by Lin (<a href="#lin2001a">2001a</a>) explains how the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of social resources available to an individual within his or her social <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>influences the success of achieving desired outcomes or goals. <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>resources are the goods possessed by individuals in the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and can consist of intangible goods such as social <span>status</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> research collaboration, and information as well as material goods, such as money or a car. Access to these resources <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on the relationship with the individual possessing the resource and where one is located in the social structure. There are three ingredients fundamental to social capital: resources embedded within the <span>network</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> access 
to these resources through relationships, and the use of the resources for purposive <span>action</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>capital, therefore, is defined '...as resources embedded in a social structure which are accessed and/or mobilized in purposive actions' (<a href="#lin2001b">Lin</a>, 2001b: 12). This theory of social capital explains how the social <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(or the social structure) constrains or enables access to resources embedded within the <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>
  
<p> The hierarchical nature of the social structure lies at the heart of the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>theory of social capital. People who occupy the same level of the hierarchy tend to be more like each other and <span>possess</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>similar resources than people who occupy different levels. It is in the nature of human beings that they prefer to interact with people who are similar to themselves in terms of lifestyles and socio-economic <span>status</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> a predisposition which Laumann (<a href="#laumann">1966</a>) calls the principle of homophily. That is, people with whom one interacts more <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>tend to have the same interests, be from the same social class, and have resources similar to <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>own. Because of the proclivity of people to interact with others who are similar to themselves, strong ties tend to develop between these individuals rather than between individuals who are dissimilar. Consequently, strong ties tend to link people who are similar, have access to the same resources, and are part of the same social strata (<a href="#mcpherson">McPherson, <em>et al.</em></a>, 2001). When seeking different resources, therefore, people need to utilize weak ties.</p>
  
<p> According to the theory of social capital, however, different resources not only lie <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>one's social group they re0e in a different level of the social hierarchy. In order to access new resources, therefore, people need to reach up or down in the social hierarchy. While people may use weak ties to access lower <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>individuals, Laumann's prestige <span>principal</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>states that people prefer to associate with others of similar or somewhat higher social <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>than they, rather than lower <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>individuals (<a href="#laumann">Laumann</a>, 1966; <a href="#lin2001a">Lin</a>, 2001a: 69). The importance of weak ties 
for gaining access to new resources is critical to Lin's conceptualization of social capital and forms the basis for his 'Strength-of-Weak-Ties' <span>proposition</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> This <span>proposition</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>draws extensively from Granovetter's (<a href="#granovetter">1973</a>) strength of weak ties argument that stresses the advantage of weak bridging ties for linking into other networks to gain information about new jobs. Lin takes this argument one step further and contends that in order to acquire new and better resources individuals will undertake instrumental <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>requiring the use of weak ties that reach upwards in the social structure.

<p> This is not to claim, however, that information is not found from consulting close ties. Much information necessary to conduct <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>everyday life is often found close to home and from close friends and <span>relatives</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> When information needs <span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>reasonable</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>solution would be to <span>observe</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>how other people in <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>group have dealt with similar situations or to ask those close to you for possible <span>explanations</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or <span>solutions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> In most cases, therefore, the situations are resolved to some extent through <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>within <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>close <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> An information problem becomes apparent when there is not a ready solution; that is, resources within <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>close social <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are not adequate to resolve the problem.

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>This study was carried out as part of my dissertation research that <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the everyday information behaviour of re0ents of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. It was conducted in the spring and summer of 2002. Mongolia is a large, sparsely populated country of two and a half million people in East Asia, wedged between Russia to the north and China to the south. It is a transitional economy that adopted a democratic form of government and free-market reforms following the withdrawal of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. By World Bank standards, Mongolia is a low-income economy that had a per capita Gross Domestic Product of US$452 in 2002 (<a href="#worldbank">World Bank</a>, 2002). It is also a highly literate country compared with other low-income economies, with a literacy rate of nearly 90% (UNDP &amp; Government of Mongolia, 2000). Ulaanbaatar is the capital and <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>city of Mongolia with a population of nearly 800,000 (<a href="#bat">Bat</a>, 2002). </p>

<h2>Data collection</h2>

<p> Data were collected using a personal <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>questionnaire that collected both <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and information seeking data. It was <span>translated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>into Mongolian and administered in a face to face format to a stratified random sample<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a> of the general population of Ulaanbaatar by research assistants who were undergraduate <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in the Department of Library and Information Science at the Cultural College of Ulaanbaatar<a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a>. The questionnaires were used to collect demographic information about the respondents, the <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of members of the respondents' social networks, and to identify an information problem and the <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>undertaken to find information about it. Two <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>matrices were used to collect demographic and <span>relational</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>information on the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>members and the strength of relationships between the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>members. Because of the <span>length</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and complexity of the questionnaire, its administration took from one and a half to two hours to complete. There were some inconsistencies in the <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of data by the research assistants particularly related to the identification of <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>members, which resulted in some missing data. Out of 320 questionnaires that were administered, 313 were complete enough to be used for the study. See Johnson (<a href="#johnson">2003</a>) for a full <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>methods.</p>
  
<p>Names of members of the social networks were generated using two methods. The first method, called the <em>name generator</em>, elicited <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by asking respondents who of their acquaintances, friends or <span>relatives</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>they would call upon in certain situations. These situations involved discussing important matters or borrowing money or household items. They were also asked to name their closest friends. Because of the nature of these situations, <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>elicited in this way tended to be close ties to the respondent. The second method used to elicit <span>names</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> called the <em>position generator</em>, was <span>devised</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by Lin &amp; Dumin (<a href="#lin1986">1986</a>) in order to determine respondents' access to resources. Rather than tying <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to specific emotional and exchange situations, <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in connection to 'ordered, structural <span>positions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>salient in a society' (<a href="#lin2001">Lin, <em>et al.</em></a>, 2001: 63). These structural <span>positions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>can be occupations, authorities, work <span>units</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or sectors. For this study respondents were asked to <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>if they knew anyone well enough to talk to in each of seventeen occupations relevant to Ulaanbaatar, ranging from housemaid at the bottom of the scale to politician at the top end. Names elicited through this method tend to be weak ties of the respondent. <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>capital is <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>based on how high up the position generator the respondent could reach (reach) and how many different occupations in which they knew people (diversity). The <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>elicited in this way comprise part of the respondents' social networks and consequently form part of the cohort out of which the respondent chose an information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Names were also elicited through questions which asked for <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of individuals approached for information in the course of seeking information to resolve their information problem. In some cases, the <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of these individuals had already been elicited through the two methods mentioned above, and in other cases they were new <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to the social <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> To preserve the confidentiality of the respondents, the research assistants replaced the <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with code numbers which were recorded in the questionnaire. </p>
  
<p>Data were collected on each individual included in the respondents' social networks. These <span>consisted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of demographic data such as age, sex, marital <span>status</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> level of <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and employment <span>status</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Data were also collected that described the respondent's relationship with the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>member. These included role relationship (kin, friend, acquaintance), emotional closeness (close, moderately close, not close), frequency of contact (once a week or more, about once a month, less than three or four times a year), duration of relationship (more than ten years, six to ten years, one to five years, and less than one year), and re0ential proximity (within walking distance, need transportation to visit, and not in Ulaanbaatar).</p>
  
<p> The information problem was educed through the critical incident <span>technique</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#flanagan">Flanagan</a>, 1954) that allows the respondents to describe a problem from their own <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and reports on their behaviour relevant to that particular problem. According to Choo (<a href="#choo">1993</a>: 107), this <span>technique</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>allows the respondents to describe the information problem in their own words and talk about the elements of the problem and the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for information that are meaningful to them. By thinking of a <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> the respondents are able to describe the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>steps taken to find information. This is more effective in discovering how people <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>search for information than asking questions about how they would resolve a hypothetical problem. Respondents were asked to, '<em>think about a recent occasion when you needed information or advice to help <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with a particular situation</em>'. Some types of problems were suggested as examples: '<em>information related either to your health or the health of a family member; about <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a job or <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>up a business; or information about government programmes related to pensions or welfare entitlements or employment training programmes...</em>' If none of these situations applied to the respondent, they were asked to <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>'<em>some other <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>when you were able to find information that helped you</em>'.  The respondents were asked to <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>where they went first to get information about this problem. There were given the <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of a <span>person</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> organization, or media <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> When respondents chose an organizational <span>source</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> they were asked to <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>whether they knew the <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>they approached and to name that <span>person</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The respondents were also asked in follow-up questions whether they approached anyone else they knew for information. All the individuals whom respondents approached for information were included in the analysis.</p>
  
<h2>Findings</h2>

<p> The respondents were almost equally likely to choose each of the three types of information sources as their first <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in their <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for information. Thirty-five percent chose people, 34% chose organizations, and 27% chose media sources as their first <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Fourteen respondents did not <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>an information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Because studies have found that the poor are associated with particular types of information behaviour, I <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>whether the level of income of the respondents had an influence on the type of information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>chosen. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>chi-squared <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>showed that there was no relationship between income and <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(chi-squared = 3.658, df = 6, p = .723).

<p> The absence of an effect of income on information seeking may be owing to the transitional nature of Mongolian society.

<p>I also <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>whether the type of problem experienced by the respondent <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>which information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>they chose. The respondents' information problems fell into thirteen categories. For the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the analysis, I focused on the four problems mentioned most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by the respondents: looking for work (19%), health-related problems (19%), financial matters (13%) and <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(13%). Together these four categories comprised 64% of all problems mentioned by the respondents. I performed a logistic <span>regression</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis on the <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as a function of the type of problem faced by the respondent (<a href="#johnson">Johnson</a>, 2003: 198). The analysis showed that people were significantly more likely to be chosen as information sources when the problem was related to either finance or <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> while organizations were more likely to be chosen for health related problems, and media sources when respondents were seeking employment related information. </p>
  
<h3>Characteristics of people information sources</h3>

<p> Ninety-six respondents named 109 people who they approached for information<a href="#note3"><sup>3</sup></a>. In order to determine how respondents chose their information sources out of the pool of available people in their networks I performed a logistic <span>regression</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis on <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of informant as a function of the demographic <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of age, sex, marital <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and level of <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information sources. Logistic <span>regression</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>indicates the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that are most <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>associated with the information sources and are predictive of who is chosen as an information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the people information sources were compared with the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of all the other people in the networks of the ninety-six respondents. The number of people in the networks of these respondents was 1448. Logistic <span>regression</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>evaluates the influence of independent variables on an event either happening or not happening; for instance, either choosing one type of information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or not choosing that <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Logistic <span>regression</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis is used when the dependent variable is dichotomous and the independent variables are continuous, dichotomous, or categorical. In this analysis the independent variable, <em>Age</em>, is categorical. Each of the categories is assessed for its impact on the outcome or dependent variable (the <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of people information sources) with <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to the youngest age category, <em>19-30</em>. <em>Sex</em> is a dichotomous independent  variable with one equal to <em>Male</em> and <span>zero</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>equal to not a male, or female.

<p>The interpretation is done in terms of the exponentiated beta <span>coefficients</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>which are equivalent to the odds <span>ratios</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Subtracting one from the odds ratio and multiplying by 100 gives the odds of something happening, for instance the odds of an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>being in one age category compared to the odds of their being in the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>category. An odds ratio greater than 1 increases the odds of something happening, while an odds ratio less than 1 lowers the odds of something happening. In this analysis, the odds of choosing an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>aged 31-40 was 140% greater than the odds of choosing an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>aged 19-30, and the odds of choosing someone 41-50 was 110% greater than the odds of choosing someone in the youngest age category. The odds of choosing males as information sources were also 70% greater than the odds of choosing females. The analysis suggests that respondents who chose people as information sources were more likely to choose middle-aged individuals<a href="#note4"><sup>4</sup></a> over younger people,  and men over women. Middle-aged people may be sources of good <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>information with their greater involvement in the work world and their greater life experience than younger members of the <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The preference for this age group over even older individuals may be owing to their greater ability to adapt to the new conditions brought about by transition and therefore their better understanding of how the new system works. The preference for male information sources over females may <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the greater authority role and <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of men in Mongolian society. </p>

<p>The results of the <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that for all indicators of closeness, respondents were significantly more likely to choose people as information sources with whom they were less closely related. The odds of choosing <span>relatives</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or friends were significantly lower than the odds of choosing an acquaintance as an information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Information sources were less likely to be close ties with the respondent, were more likely to be known by the respondent for less than five years, to be in contact with the respondent less <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>than other members of his or her <span>network</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and to live further than walking distance away from the respondent. For all of these closeness indicators, factors associated with weak ties were highly predictive of whom respondents would choose as information sources. In order to find information to help them with their problems respondents went to their weak ties, who presumably possessed the new information not possessed by people with whom they were more closely related. </p>
  
<h3>Comparison of information sources and respondents</h3>

<p> In the previous section we saw that the people respondents chose as information sources differed significantly from other people in their networks in terms of <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and tended to be weak ties with the respondents. In this section I <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>how the information seekers (the respondents) differ from the information sources. Since the purposive <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for information usually involves seeking new resources, I <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that the principle of homophily would not apply and that people chosen as information sources would have <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that are different and, in some <span>senses</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> better than the respondents. For this 
analysis I conducted a chi-squared (&#967;<sup style="font-size: x-small;">2</sup>)  <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that compared the frequency <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of aggregated <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the respondents with the <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the aggregated <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information sources.

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>The <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the study support the strength-of-weak-tie-proposition of the theory of social capital which <span>predicted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that when seeking new information, people will use their weak ties to access people with better resources than theirs. Out of all the people available in their social networks, respondents were more likely to choose those with whom they were weakly tied and who possessed better <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>resources than others in their <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in terms of age (middle-aged) and level of <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(university-educated). Respondents were also significantly different from their information sources; information sources tended to be older, married, and to have a university <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and, in addition, were more <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>employed than the respondents.</p>
  
<p>Weak ties are valuable resources when seeking new information because they provide access to information <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of close ties. Because people with close ties tend to interact <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with each other and know the same people, information possessed by one <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>can quickly spread <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> In order to find new information, one must often seek out people in other social <span>circles</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> According to Lin, homophilous <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is the normal type of <span>interaction</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and there is a '<em>normative match between effort and return</em>' (<a href="#lin2001a">Lin</a>, 2001a: 59). Lin goes on to <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that since heterophilous <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are between people who are dissimilar there may be a greater effort involved in initiating this kind of <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as well as greater uncertainty about the outcome. However, because of the effort involved there may also be a greater expectation of the benefit that will result from the <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(see <a href="#lin2001a">Lin</a>: 50-51). The <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of a <span>person</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> therefore, is not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the easiest option, or 'the path of least <span>resistance</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> as suggested by Durrance (<a href="#durrance">1988</a>) and others. It indicates, rather, that there may be an even greater <span>psychological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>effort since the persons chosen as information sources tend not to be well known by and to be different from the respondents. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>weak tie on its own, however, was not a <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>qualification as an information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Weak ties also tended to connect respondents to people with better resources in terms of life experience, knowledge, and <span>status</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> indicating the purposive and deliberate nature of their information seeking. The theory of social capital explains why the use of people as sources of new information is not always a <em>least effort</em> option since respondents appear to take great pains to scan their networks for the best sources they feel will help them, rather than those most readily at hand.</p>
  
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p> This study demonstrates the importance of weak ties in the information seeking process, and suggests that there are factors other than least effort that explain the use of people as information sources. The <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of this study, however, may not be applicable to the general population and may be confined to the study participants and relevant to the particular information problems used in the <span>analyses</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The missing data from the thirty-two respondents who also chose people as information sources but whose tie information was not collected, may also have affected the results. The <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for the study, as well, may be a mitigating factor since the constraints on Mongolians' information behaviour may differ from those in the West and the information problems may have different cultural meanings. The <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>do <span>suggest</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> however, that the <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of information is complex and needs to be <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>at a more finely-grained level to determine what factors affect who is chosen and under what circumstances. The theory of social capital provides a useful <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>within which to examine information behaviour and to understand how social structure affects <span>choice</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p> <a name="note1" id="note1"></a>1. Respondents were chosen from five districts in the city 
  of Ulaanbaatar including one of the ger districts (semi-formal suburbs on the 
  city's fringe).</p>
<p> <a name="note2" id="note2"></a>2. As part of my agreement to receive research assistance 
  for this project from the Department of Library and Information Science at the 
  Cultural College, I gave ten hours of <span>lectures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on information science subjects 
  to senior <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> At the close of these sessions, I and one of the teachers 
  at the college selected twenty-six <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to administer the questionnaires based on 
  their aptitude for the task and their willingness and motivation to take part. 
  These <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>attended a three-day workshop where they were instructed in the 
  concepts of information seeking and social <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis, the importance 
  of abiding by the confidentiality requirements and of following the proper protocol 
  for dealing with respondents. </p>
<p><a name="note3" id="note3"></a>3. An additional thirty-two respondents approached people for 
  information, but the code numbers of the people approached were not included 
  in the questionnaires by the research assistants and consequently their demographic 
  and <span>relational</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>characteristics could not be identified. Therefore they could 
  not be included in the analysis</p>
<p><a name="note4" id="note4"></a>4. Since the life expectancy in Mongolia is 63 years, 
  describing people aged 31-50 as middle aged is appropriate (UNDP &amp; Government 
  of Mongolia, 2000).</p>

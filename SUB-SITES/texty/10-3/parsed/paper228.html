<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Defining public-sector information</h3>

<p>The definition of public-sector information  <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on the definition adopted for public sector, and this is very much dependent on the political and administrative culture and organisation of each country or a set of countries. The Green Paper on <em>Public sector information in the information society</em> (<a href="#eu98">1998</a>)  <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to three possible <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>emerging from <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on access to public sector information:</p>

<blockquote>The functional approach, in which the public sector includes those <span>bodies</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>with state authority or public service tasks;<br /><br>

The legalist/institutional approach, in which only <span>bodies</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that are explicitly listed in the relevant <span>laws</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>have a public sector character;<br /><br>

The financial approach, whereby the public sector includes all <span>bodies</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>mainly financed by public funds (i.e. not operating under the normal market rules) (p. 11).</blockquote>

<p>The Green Paper adds that state owned companies operating under market conditions and subject to private and commercial <span>laws</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> are not meant to be covered by either of these <span>definitions</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Communication from the Commission (<a href="#eu01">2001</a>) <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to article 1 of Directive 92/50 of 18th June 1992, relating to the co-ordination of procedures for the award of public services contracts, to provide a definition of public bodies:</p>

<blockquote>[Bodies] <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for the specific purpose of meeting needs in the general interest, not having an <span>industrial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or commercial character; having legal personality; and financed, for the most part, by the state, or regional or local authorities, or other <span>bodies</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>governed by public law (p. 11).</blockquote>

<p>Finally, Directive 2003/98/EC , on the re-use of public sector information, adopts the definition of the above quotation for public sector, and defines document as follows:</p>

<blockquote>It covers any <span>representation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of acts, facts or information - and any compilation of such acts, facts or information - whatever its <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>(written on paper, or stored in electronic form or as a sound, <span>visual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or audiovisual recording), <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by public <span>bodies</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>document <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by a public sector body is a document where the public sector body has the right to authorise re-use. (<a href="#eu03">European Commission, 2003</a>: 91).</blockquote>

<p>Concerning the availability of the information produced by those public <span>bodies</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> and in the absence of specific guidelines, the producing body is <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to decide how to make it available: <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the end-users, <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>a public/private partnership, or outsourcing the commercial exploitation of that information to private operators. But the Directive clarifies that activities falling <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the public task 'will typically include supply of <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that are produced and charged for exclusively on a commercial basis and in competition with others in the market' (p. 91).</p>

<h3>Approaching the problem</h3>

<p>The purpose of this paper is to develop a <em>stakeholder</em> model for the <em>public sector information system</em>. The foundations for the model are provided by the stakeholder theory and the <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>theory. The principle of coproduction is applied to the public sector information system by building on lessons from the field of development studies.</p>

<p>Insights from stakeholder analysis <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that the <em>principle of fairness</em> sets <span>limits</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on which groups are stakeholders, based on their participation in a mutually beneficial scheme of co-operation. It is <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that obligations of fairness are created among the participants in a co-operative scheme, in proportion to the benefits received. Applying this principle to the public sector information system means that the strength of the bonds of each of the stakeholder groups to the system may vary substantially.</p>

<p>The systemic approach is characterised by its ability to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>with the complexity, the ill-definition and the ambiguity that our present world-vision identifies as attributes of the natural world, of  human beings and of their creations. For this reason, the <em>systemic vision</em> seemed particularly appropriate to guide the approach to the maze of <span>so-called</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>public-sector information, to break away from the usual compartmentalisation based on the public sector <span>bodies</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that collect, produce and disseminate that information, and to review that complex in terms of the entities that interact and of the nature and motivations of their <span>interactions</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>result is a holistic, organic and dynamic vision of what is usually seen as a fragmented and inert complex of public <span>bodies</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and the information they generate.</p>

<p>The very notion of model implies that it is a simplified <span>representation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the reality, to make it more intelligible. In this case, it is a <em>cognitive model</em> (as <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to decisional, normative or forecasting model) retaining only the more important elements and the most significant <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the system. The desired outcome is to clear the scene and expose the core elements, to allow a renewed appreciation of the problem: Who are the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>public sector information stakeholder groups? Why do they interact with each other? What <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>do they play? Is there a sound basis where to ground expectations of engaging those groups in the working of the system? Answering those questions may contribute to a better understanding of the public sector information complex as an open system, whose entities can engage in a <em>co-operative behaviour</em>, even though the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and scope of co-operation may vary substantially. It may also contribute to the development of <em>information policies</em>, in particular government information resource management policy and government information dissemination policy.</p>

<h2>The vision <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the model</h2>

<h3>The stakeholder concept</h3>

<p>The stakeholder concept emerged in the 1960s among academics at the Stanford Research Institute, who proposed that, <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of focusing exclusively on shareholders, a firm also should be responsible to a variety of stakeholders without whose support the organisation would collapse. The <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>was made known by Freeman (<a href="#fre84">1984</a>), who also expanded it to include in the stakeholder definition 'any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organisation's objectives'. This <span>expansion</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the original concept resulted in widening the view of the firm from a strictly economic view to a political view.</p>

<p>Stoney and Winstanley note that the use of the concept has extrapolated from the managerial context of corporate governance to the field of political economy, where the policy implications of stakeholding have been widely explored:</p>

<blockquote>For example, depending on which version of stakeholding we examine, it is <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to provide the basis for a personal philosophy, a new and enlightened corporate ethos, a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to guide changes in corporate governance and even a platform for widespread economic and political reform. (<a href="#sto01">Stoney &amp; Winstanley, 2001</a>: 606)</blockquote>

<p>These authors developed a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>containing five relevant continuums, with the aim of providing the basis to clarify <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>research and debate in this field. Each continuum is used to <span>map</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the various perspectives concurring to the stakeholder debate, with <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to relevant authors, to exemplify different <span>positions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or approaches:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>Continuum <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>displays the left-right <span>spectrum</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of views <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by those who support or criticise stakeholding;</li>

<li>Continuum B displays the <span>spectrum</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>concerning the purpose of stakeholding (from research tool to prescriptive framework);</li>

<li>Continuum C displays the <span>spectrum</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that reflects how stakeholding is regarded (from an "end in itself" to "means to an end");</li>

<li>Continuum D is concerned with the level at which stakeholding principles are <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in order to be effective (individual level, corporate level, state level or international level);</li>

<li>Continuum E <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of coercion required to implement stakeholding (ethos, exhortation, best practice, <span>codes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of conduct, directives, legal entrenchment of stakeholder rights).</li>
</ol>

<p>Of particular interest to the argument developed here are the continuums D and E. Continuum D provides support for positioning our stakeholder categories and focusing the debate on the level of public policy and institutional reform. Continuum E raised awareness to and helped reflection on the relative <span>weight</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the bonds of each of the stakeholder groups to the public sector information system.</p>

<p>Stakeholding implies always some notion of <em>co-operation</em>. Argyle (<a href="#arg91">1991</a>: 7) notes that 'individuals are constantly pursuing their own goals, but usually in a fairly harmonious way, within the rules, as part of a co-operative social system'. <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><em>et al.</em> (<a href="#smi95">1995</a>) highlight that trust emerges as a key antecedent to co-operation, but that very little exists in the management literature on the specific <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of <em>trust</em>. They <span>suggest</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> therefore, that <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>from other disciplines might provide important insights.</p>

<h3>The <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>concept</h3>

<p>Bertalanffy (<a href="#ber67">1967</a>) developed the <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>concept for the field of <span>Biology</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Scientists in other fields, <span>namely</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the physical sciences and the social sciences, soon imported it. In his seminal work, Miller (<a href="#mil95">1995</a>) presents the general living <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>theory as a conceptual system concerned with <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>existing in space-time, along0e <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>hierarchical levels: <span>cell</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> organ, organism, group, organisation, society and supranational system.</p>

<p>When applied to organisation studies, <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>theory regards organisations as <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>composed of entities (groups and individuals), and elements or variables (structures, processes, <span>roles</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> needs or <span>psychological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>states) which are in fact <span>qualities</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or states of entities in the system (<a href="#nar93">Narayanan &amp; Nath 1993</a>). Although they are a special class of social <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> with properties of their own, they share other properties in common with all open systems: the importation of <span>energy</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>from the <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> the transformation of that <span>energy</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>into some product characteristic of the system, and the exporting of that product into the <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> in a permanent cycle.</p>

<p>Even though the existence of system boundaries is taken for granted, they may be stable at one point, but may change over time, and may differ according to the <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>adopted. Interactions between the organisation and its <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>emerge as the most significant aspect of organisational phenomena. To cope with this new area of organisational <span>concern</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> a whole new <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of concepts was created and developed. Katz &amp; Kahn (<a href="#kat78">1978</a>) proposed the concepts of system openness, system coding, system boundaries and boundary <span>roles</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> which are <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the paradigm of organisations as open <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The concept of <em>system openness</em> <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to which the system is receptive to all types of inputs and <em>system coding</em> <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the procedure used to insure specifications for the intake of information and <span>energy</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> and it in fact describes the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>functioning of barriers separating the system from its <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> The concept of <em>system boundary</em> is <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as the demarcation <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or <span>regions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for the definition of appropriate system activity, for admission of members and for other imports into the system, and <em>boundary roles</em> are described as the boundary <span>positions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by some members of the organisation in order to help in the export of services, ideas and other products of the system and in the import of materials and people into the system.</p>

<p>The open <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>approach to the study of organisations implies that the organisations interact with their environments and that their survival <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and timing of those <span>interactions</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> The information processing <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> in particular, argues that individual actors <em>enact</em> the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to which the organisation then adapts. It follows that the task of organising consists in developing a shared interpretation of the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and then acting on the basis of that interpretation. Information is processed in order to reduce or resolve equivocality. The <em>enactment</em> concept was originally developed by Weick (<a href="#wei69">1969</a>); later, Weick and Daft (<a href="#wei83">1983</a>) proposed a model of organisations as <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>systems.</p>

<p>The <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>approach may be applied to a single organisation, or to a cluster of organisations that have developed some <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of co-operation, <span>independently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of national boundaries. Moreover, the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and scope of co-operation may vary substantially: from a stable and coherent <span>framework</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> to loose and occasional exchanges, which result nevertheless in <span>mutual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>benefit.</p>

<h3>Citizens</h3>

<p>The concept of citizenship may be described simply as the participation in a <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> For this reason, different types of political communities gave <span>origin</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to different forms of citizenship. The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>difference between the citizenship of a city-state in <span>ancient</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Greece and the citizenship of the <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>democratic nation-state consists in the <span>extension</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or scope of the political <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in each of them. In <span>ancient</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Greece, the citizenship was the privileged <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the ruling class in the city-state, while in the <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>democratic nation-state the citizenship is based on the capacity to participate in the exercise of the political power through elections.</p>

<p>The concept of citizenship in Marshall and Bottomore (<a href="#mar92">1992</a>) is defined by <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to a specific <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of rights and institutions within which the individual rights are exercised. This <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>was structured <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the last three <span>centuries</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> and three <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>phases can be identified.</p>

<p>The first phase occurred mainly in the eighteenth century, consisting in the structuring of the <em>civil citizenship</em>. In this phase, the rights needed for individual freedom were established: the right to property, the right to freedom of <span>expression</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> and especially the right to justice. The second phase developed mainly during the nineteenth century and corresponds to the <em>political citizenship</em>, that is, the right to participate in the exercise of political power, through the vote. The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>phase was built in the twentieth century and corresponds to the <em>social citizenship</em>, meaning the establishment of minimum patterns of <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and social protection to be guaranteed by the Welfare State, with the purpose of reducing social inequalities. The succession of these rights, however, did not obey to a <span>linear</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>sequence</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Unlike the <span>universal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>character of the civil and political rights, social rights work as institutional <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to compensate the gap between the legal and political <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of equality among citizens and the social and economic inequalities resulting from the market relations. Several critics, including Barbalet (<a href="#bar88">1988</a>), have noted that Marshall <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to extend his idea of citizenship to include economic and cultural citizenship, that is, economic and cultural democracy. Barbalet also argues that Marshall <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the relationship between the different elements of citizenship, that is, to treat the means through which the <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>sets of rights function together as components of a unified citizenship.</p>

<p>Turner avoids the <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on juridical or political <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of citizenship, <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as the 'status within a polity which determines the nature of rights and obligations' and proposes a sociological definition: 'a set of <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>which constitute individuals as competent members of a <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> (<a href="#tur94">Turner 1994</a>: 159). Those who do not <span>possess</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the competencies needed to participate actively in their respective communities are threatened by exclusion. The excluded are not taken into account; they are a dead <span>weight</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for society that regards them as dispensable. For Fitoussi and Rosanvallon (<a href="#fit97">1997</a>) this exclusion corresponds, in economic terms, to the banishment of political dis0ents in authoritarian regimes. For this reason, they argue, the right to social inclusion should become part of the agenda to claim for a new type of rights, which have to do with the civic imperative of participation and the right to social usefulness. This <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>provides support to those who demand <em>freedom of access to information</em> by all citizens.</p>

<p>Another aspect worthy of exploration is the opposition between the concepts of citizen and client vis-&agrave;-vis the public administration. The <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of one or the other is usually associated with different perspectives about the role of the public administration, and the controversy around private-style management versus public-style management applied to public sector organisations.</p>

<p>Table 1 compares the logics <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the concepts of client and citizen, which affect their relationship with the two <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of organisations (private corporation and public administration).</p>

<p>This <span>table</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>shows that the public administration answers not only to the citizens' needs, but also to government policies, drafted presumably in accordance to constitutional imperatives. Mozzicafreddo argues that this specificity dissuades the assimilation of the concept of citizen to that of client, since citizen is a social and contractual category, implying rights and obligations, to which the administration and the government are bound. On the other hand, client is an individual category, derived from the individual <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the client with the private corporation, and the reciprocity rights are based on the client's capacity to pay.</p>

<h3>Businesses</h3>

<p>As described above, citizenship <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the rights and obligations of an individual member of a nation-state. Can that concept be expanded to accommodate the notion of <em>corporate citizenship</em>? Marsden and Andriof <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that companies, as <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>legal entities, are members of countries and can be thought of as corporate citizens with legal rights and duties. They add that 'good corporate citizenship is about understanding and managing an organisation's influences on and relationships with the <span>rest</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of society in a way that minimises the negative and maximises the positive' (<a href="#mar98">Marsden and Andriof 1998</a>: 329). For Carroll (<a href="#car98">1998</a>) 'corporate citizenship addresses the relationship between companies and all their important stakeholders' (p. 2) and good corporate citizens are <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to: a) be profitable, b) obey the law, c) engage in ethical behaviour and d) give back through philanthropy.</p>

<p>Just as individual citizens are <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to work and earn an income as good participating citizens, <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>organisations are <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to generate income <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to pay their bills and reward their investors. Like individual citizens, good corporate citizens are <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to obey the law. Government <span>laws</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and regulations are created to bring about social benefits that those individuals and companies, each acting in their own self-interest, do not seem able to generate. However, businesses wishing to be regarded as good corporate citizens not only generate <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>income and obey the law, they also need to operate in an ethical manner. Finally, good corporate citizens contribute to the communities where they operate, and this is usually <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>through philanthropic donations. Naturally it can be questioned whether corporations engage in philanthropic actions because it is in their own <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>financial interests to do so or because they genuinely care about the recipients of their philanthropy.</p>

<p>Van Buren (<a href="#van01">2001</a>) notes that naming which groups are stakeholders seems to be a necessary precondition to specifying what corporate citizenship is and what responsibilities 'good corporate citizens' should fulfil. Building on insights from stakeholder analysis, the principle of fairness sets <span>limits</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on which groups are stakeholders. Obligations of fairness are created among the participants in a co-operative scheme in proportion to the benefits received. In this context, 'a stakeholder is any group that is part of a mutually beneficial scheme of co-operation'. From a corporate <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> such a designation includes shareholders, employees, suppliers, communities, governments and other groups that provide resources and receive benefits in support of that scheme of co-operation.</p>

<p>Underlying most of the corporate citizenship literature is the implicit <span>proposition</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that corporations have responsibilities, grounded in some notion of ethical responsibility, beyond legal obligations. In this <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of analysis, just as individuals have citizen-related responsibilities beyond obeying the law, so do corporations. Carroll (<a href="#car98">1998</a>) clarifies that 'business <span>ethics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is concerned both with developing <span>codes</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> concepts and <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of acceptable <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>behaviour and with carrying out these <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in all <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>dealings with its various stakeholders' (p. 4).</p>

<p>In an increasingly globalised marketplace, national governments find it more and more difficult to effectively regulate corporate behaviour. The weakening of formal power of national governments and the present inadequacy of international regulatory authority tend to create a power vacuum. On the other hand, as <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>globalises, companies tend to operate more and more efficiently and their impact on people's lives increases dramatically.</p>

<p>There are strong arguments that companies will only do what they <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as <em>affordable</em> and not really address the fundamental issues that might seriously affect their earning capacity. Vidaver-Cohen and Altman (<a href="#vid00">2000</a>), quoted by <span>Van</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Buren (<a href="#van01">2001</a>), argue that the corporate citizenship concept is still a work in progress, and there is not yet, an <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>deontological basis for claiming that corporations have citizenship responsibilities, or even that the citizenship idea is applicable to corporations. And, without an adequate normative grounding, the corporate citizenship concept may be used in such a variety of ways by different groups, that it fails to progress beyond being a metaphor.</p>

<p>In fact, while the rights and obligations of the individual citizens are clearly regulated, from a juridical and political point of view, specifying the content and normative basis for corporate citizenship remains a challenge for both scholars and practitioners. What is proposed here is that, <span>extending</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the citizenship idea so as to embrace the metaphor of corporate citizenship, seems less problematic if the <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on <em>juridical and political <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of citizenship</em> (which inform the traditional idea of citizenship as the <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>within a polity, that determines the nature of rights and obligations) is dropped in favour of a <em>sociological definition of citizenship</em> such as that proposed by Turner (<a href="#tur94">1994</a>): a set of <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>which constitute citizens (or corporations) as competent members of a <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>In spite of its weaknesses, the concept of corporate citizenship is useful to differentiate the evolving double role of businesses in <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>society: responsible members of a <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> as well as creators of richness. It also helps to characterise different information needs, according to the different <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>played and the different <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>pursued.</p>

<h3>Policy-makers</h3>

<p>Hajer (<a href="#haj03">2003</a>) notes that the study of policymaking assumes a) the existence of a political context - a polity - characterised by a stable political order (typically the nation-state); b) the production of knowledge that is for politics but in itself scientific, not political; c) a problem-oriented, meaningful policy intervention with the aim of changing the course of events. However, this assumed background has changed dramatically over the last two decades. The stable polity, in particular, is being challenged by the developments that gave <span>rise</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the concept of <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>society (<a href="#cas96">Castells 1996</a>). Hajer argues that</p>

<blockquote>The implosion of the territorial order of <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>government <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>us fundamentally to rethink the basis of effective political intervention, and hence of policy making. It also calls for a renewed con0eration of the legitimacy of policy interventions (<a href="#haj03">Hajer 2003</a>: 183).</blockquote>

<p>He further notes that, under such conditions, policy deliberation becomes the locus of <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and trust, and that be0es <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>problems, policymaking is also about 'finding formats that generate trust among mutually interdependent actors'. This emergent pattern of governance <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> he warns, <span>raises</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>issues of political legitimacy, since policymaking is no longer a matter of government intervention alone, but also a matter concerning citizens and companies. Hajer is in fact referring to the transition from a polity based on a stable political order where 'codified arrangements... provide the official <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of policymaking and politics' (<a href="#haj03">Hajer 2003</a>: 176), to a discursive polity, where the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>practice of policymaking takes place in an institutional void.</p>

<p>The developments that lead to the transition from standalone, legitimate government to governance <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>justify to a large extent the widespread interest in <em>trust</em> manifest in the literature, from the sociological and political field, to the information field (<a href="#fuk96">Fukuyama 1996</a>; <a href="#gid98">Giddens 1998</a>; <a href="#raa02">Raab 2002</a>; <a href="#huo04">Huotari &amp; Iivonen, 2004</a>).</p>

<p>On the other hand, those developments also lead to a transition from the Weberian bureaucracy to the <em>infocracy</em> (<a href="#zuu02">Zuurmond 2002</a>). Zuurmond notes that the use of <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>technology and the aggregation of information across its many organisations alter the structure of the bureaucracy, which becomes flatter and more flexible, while at the same time the power of the individual bureaucrat diminishes, but the control levels become higher than ever:</p>

<blockquote>This control is now exerted through the information infrastructure of the inter-organisation, <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of through the structure of the organisation. This change has led us to the <span>conclusion</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that the bureaucracy is being replaced by an infocracy. (<a href="#zuu02">Zuurmond 2002</a>: 271)</blockquote>

<p>Anderson (<a href="#and90">1990</a>) developed a model of the policymaking process, breaking it down into several stages, thus shedding some light on the process: 1) problem identification and agenda formation; 2) policy formulation; 3) policy adoption; 4) policy implementation; 5) post-implementation evaluation. The process-oriented approach to the study of policymaking may yield interesting results, since it reveals the complexity of the process, the multitude of intervenients and their <span>roles</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> the kind of information used to inform the process, the <span>weight</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the institutional factors and bureaucratic goals.</p>

<p>Like public policy in general, <em>information policy</em> is subject to the influence of the political, social and cultural context, where powerful stakeholders lobby for their interests. This is a battleground where <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and priorities are confronted. The policymaker has to decide in conditions of uncertainty, restricted time-horizons, and <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>interests. It has been noted that one of the least explored aspects of policymaking is how certain issues become part of the political agendas while others do not.</p>

<p>Information policymaking emerged as a relevant <span>segment</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of public policymaking in general, mainly as a result of the convergence of the developments in computing and telecommunications, in the seventies. These developments have become so compelling and pervasive that the regulatory initiatives need to address an extremely wide <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of issues. Quoting Chartrand (<a href="#cha86">1986</a>) and Milevski (<a href="#mil86">1986</a>), Rowlands (<a href="#row96">1996</a>: 20) lists nine broad categories of information policies: 1) government information resource management policy; 2) information technology policy; 3) telecommunications and broadcasting policy; 4) international communications policy; 5) information disclosure, confidentiality and privacy; 6) <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>regulation and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>crime; 7) intellectual property; 8) library and archives policy; 9) government information dissemination policy.</p>

<p>Rowlands argues that the fundamental role of information policy is 'to provide the legal and institutional frameworks within which formal information exchange can take place' (<a href="#row96">Rowlands 1996</a>: 14). As noted by Rowlands, this implies that information policy addresses both political and bureaucratic goals, and that these may not be <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>congruent. On the other hand, Browne (<a href="#bro97">1997</a>) notes that, while the information technologies proliferate and converge, and the information and media industries have been attending to their interests by securing copyright protection, the ordinary citizen risks being overlooked in the formation of policy agendas.</p>

<h3>Administrations</h3>

<p>Public administrations support all the government functions and at the same time act as the interface between governments and citizens and businesses. This is a difficult role, and the complexity of the tasks performed is often overlooked, the <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the public in general being attracted only to the malfunctioning of those complex <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> which have become an almost-synonym to bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Public organisations, it is often argued, are change resistant, slow and inept. According to this <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of argument, public organisations are less innovative than private sector organisations. Yet, Damanpour and Evan (<a href="#dam84">1984</a>), for example, argue that <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>evidence does not support the claim that public organisations are less innovative than other types of organisations. Baldridge and Burnham (<a href="#bal75">1975</a>) went further in arguing that large, complex and heterogeneous organisations such as governmental ministries are more likely to be innovative than small, simple and homogeneous organisations, because large organisations create problems of coordination, control and management that demand innovative <span>solutions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Peled defines public innovation as:</p>

<blockquote>A political process that propels organisations to launch a significant new public project that alters rules, <span>roles</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> procedures, and structures that are related to the communication and exchange of information within the organisation and between the organisation and its surrounding <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> (<a href="#pel01">Peled 2001</a>: 189)</blockquote>

<p>Peled adds that such projects do not <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>invention</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of new technologies, but do demand the redesign of organisational processes and the injection of new administrative resources and technical competence into the organisation. He also recalls that this is the reason why innovative public projects face opposition from departments and individuals who fear that their jobs and <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>may be negatively affected by the changes <span>introduced</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>As mentioned before, the open <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>approach to the study of organisations implies that the organisations interact with their environments and that their survival <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and timing of those <span>interactions</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Peled wondered how did the members of public sector organisations make sense out of new issues, how did they learn about the implications of these new issues for their organisations, and how did organisations convert new global <span>abstract</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>issues into local agendas and <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>plans. He found that innovation in public organisations is driven by coalitions that are self-organising <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in nature, cohering in <em>issue-networks</em>. The network-coalition-institution process model proposed by Peled explains several critical aspects of public technological innovation.</p>

<p>According to Upton and Swinden (<a href="#upt98">1998</a>), the <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>towards an "information age government" <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>upon five critical success factors: 1) <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of services, in order to facilitate services in a more targeted and user-friendly way; 2) establishment of partnerships across public services and with external agencies, acting as the public interface with all levels of government service; 3) consulting with citizens, and encouraging citizens to participate in shaping service delivery; 4) improving public access to services, by delivering services into the home, workplace or in a public place by phone, <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or face-to-face and 5) sharing resources (avoiding duplications and offering self-service <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to citizens).</p>

<p>However, Mozzicafreddo (<a href="#moz01">2001</a>) con0ers that putting the public administration to the service of citizens is not just a matter of improving procedures, but mainly a matter of making public policies more democratic. He argues that it is useless to develop an efficient administration when the public system displays an obvious <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of equity in the taxation of work and in the redistribution of public resources, for example. These inequalities generate dysfunctions in the relationship between the citizen and the public administration, characterised, among other negative aspects, by <span>mutual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>distrust.</p>

<p>This author also thinks that the role of the public administration is not just to <em>serve the individual citizen</em>, but also to <em>serve the democratic state</em>. The standardisation of situations, benefits and administrative procedures is one of the <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the democratic state to introduce the equality of treatment and eliminate the asymmetries brought about by the market. He argues that the democratic state has to control not only the public policies but also the corporatism of the civil society (groups of citizens and groups of social and economic agents), through administrative procedures and processes. The normative, <span>rational</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and bureaucratic model of the public administration would, from this <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> be the appropriate model to a democratic society concerned with the institutional regulation of the social relationships.</p>

<p>But this <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>also recognises the need and scope for improvement in the public administration, from increased efficiency (simplification of procedures and coordination of subsystems) to increased effectiveness (citizen-centred approach and timely response).</p>

<h2>The public sector information subsystems</h2>

<h3>Subsystem of citizenship information</h3>

<p>By citizenship information is meant the information needed by all stakeholders in order to become competent members of a society.</p>

<p>Within this subsystem, the <strong>citizens</strong> are the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>stakeholders. Citizens need information that enables them to exercise their civil, political and social rights and accomplish their correlative obligations. This set of information includes information on political processes, on social benefits, on local level services and activities, on health, safety and consumer protection, and also cultural information.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned before that the corporate citizenship concept is still a work in progress, that there is not yet an <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>deontological basis for claiming that corporations have citizenship responsibilities, or even that the citizenship idea is applicable to corporations. It was also noticed that the voluntary acceptance by companies of the need to manage their external impacts in association with those affected is becoming <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the working of <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>society. Finally, it was argued that it is less problematic to extend the citizenship idea so as to embrace the metaphor of corporate citizenship if the <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on juridical and political <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of citizenship is dropped in favour of a sociological definition such as that proposed by Turner (<a href="#tur94">1994</a>), as a set of <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>which constitute citizens (or corporations) as competent members of a <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>From this <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> businesses need information to help them reach a good citizenship <span>performance</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> This includes information on environmental and social issues, where to ground the development of pragmatic social responsiveness, <span>namely</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>through <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>employment schemes for excluded groups, training programmes, consortium <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to urban renewal, or by financing initiatives of local heritage or cultural associations.</p>

<p>But policymakers also need information that helps them understand the citizenship <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and needs of individuals and businesses.</p>

<p>Finally, administrations need information that enables them to provide in the most effective and friendly way, information adapted to previously identified needs and citizen-focused services, contributing in this manner to allow citizens and corporations to become competent members of the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>Subsystem of economic and social development information</h3>

<p>By economic and social development information, is meant the information needed by all stakeholders to give their specific <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for the economic and social development of the society they are part of.</p>

<p>Within this subsystem, <strong>businesses</strong> are the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>stakeholders. Businesses not only pay their taxes, they are the pivots of economy. They take risks and invest private funds in order to generate income <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to pay their bills, reward their investors and pay those who work for them. They create jobs, while they produce goods or services. Businesses need information to create richness and become competitive. This set of information includes legal and regulatory information, financial and economic information, <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>information, <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>information and information on corporate taxes.</p>

<p>No <span>doubt</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>citizens contribute to the development of the society that supports them, by working and earning an income. And by accomplishing their contributive obligations (i.e., by paying their taxes) they provide the basis upon which governments build the administrative, justice, health, educational and other infrastructures that make up the backbone of a civilised society, as we know it. In order to accomplish their contributive obligations, citizens need specific information. This is basically information on income taxes.</p>

<p>Policymakers need information that enables them to draft the policies required for the national or regional economic and social development. That includes indicators of economic and social development, information on national and regional plans and ongoing development programmes, or investment programmes of <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>corporations in core economic sectors.</p>

<p>Administrations, in turn, need to have access to information and training that enables them to facilitate the information and services needed by citizens (individual and corporate) to pay their taxes and by businesses to create richness and become competitive, and by policymakers to draft the appropriate policies.</p>

<h3>Subsystem of policy information</h3>

<p>By policy information, is meant the information needed by all stakeholders to understand the policy frameworks that affect their daily lives, professional <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>activities.</p>

<p>Within this subsystem, the <strong>policymakers</strong> are the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>stakeholders. Policymakers need information that enables them to get a holistic and articulated view of the policies concerning each problem under appreciation. This set of information may include information on national plans and policies, on international activities and negotiations, legislative and regulatory frameworks, regional or local management issues, public sector agencies' missions and milestones, indicators of economic and social impact, and <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>forecasts and scenario-building studies. Some of this input to policy formation comes from commissioned research, public hearings and specialist advice.</p>

<p>But citizens and businesses also need information to enable them to understand the policy frameworks that affect, <span>respectively</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> their daily lives and their <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>activities.</p>

<p>As for the administrations, they need information that helps them implement the policies applicable in each case, in an efficient and effective way.</p>

<h3>Subsystem of administrative information</h3>

<p>By administrative information, is meant the information needed by all stakeholders to provide the state with <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>information regarding personal and corporate situations.</p>

<p>Within this subsystem, the <strong>administrations</strong> are the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>stakeholders. It is the administrations' task to provide the necessary information and services, while administrations themselves need to have access to information and training that will enable their staff to fulfil their role of supporting the functioning of the state and of the civil society. Establishing appropriate infrastructures such as government-wide intranets, shared databases and common information platforms, helps administrations to exchange information and implement more effective information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services. Appropriate motivation and reward schemes, as well as access to qualification, are of <span>prime</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>importance.</p>

<p>Citizens and businesses alike contribute to this subsystem by providing <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>information regarding personal and corporate situations, willingly and on time. Citizens need information on how to request certificates or personal <span>documents</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> how to communicate the change of address or to register a new car, and also how to apply for a building permission or to make a declaration to the police. Businesses need information on how to register a new company, how to submit data to the <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>offices, to get environment-related permits or to prepare a customs declaration.</p>

<p>As for the policymakers, they are <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to understand the nature and implications of the relationship between both citizens and businesses, and the state, as well as the double role played by administrations: supporting the functioning of the democratic state and of the civil society.</p>

<p>But it is the administrations' responsibility to provide information on these administrative procedures, as part of the provision of the services themselves, in the most integrated, friendly and less time-consuming fashion.</p>

<h2>The public sector information system</h2>

<p>Public sector information is commonly regarded a maze of paper and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>files, poorly managed by inept civil servants. This vision is biased, simplistic and reductionist. It is biased, because it ignores that the logic of public service <span>differs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>from the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>logic, as reminded by Mozzicafreddo (<a href="#moz01">
2001</a>). It is simplistic, because it ignores the immense complexity of the administrative structures that produce and manage large <span>amounts</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of information, their dependency from political agendas that are often incongruent, and the frequent shortage of resources. And it is reductionist because it relegates the other stakeholders (citizens, businesses and policymakers) to the role of entities external to the system.</p>

<p>In this paper, a systemic approach to public sector information is proposed. Public sector information is defined as a <em>conceptual system</em>, insofar as it is an <span>abstraction</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>conceptual system may become a <em>technical system</em> if <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and telecommunications technology is used to support the information needs of a social system (an organisation or a community). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>conceptual system may become a <em>socio-technical system</em> if participative methodologies are used to build and develop the technical system.</p>

<p>The public sector information system, as proposed here, comprises entities grouped into four <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>categories of stakeholders (citizens, businesses, policymakers and administrations). This system also comprises elements grouped into four broad categories of information (citizenship information, economic and social development information, policy information and administrative information). These stakeholder categories and these information categories can be assimilated into four subsystems (subsystem of citizenship information, subsystem of economic and social development information, subsystem of policy information, and subsystem of administrative information), which were described above. 

<span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>2 shows how the public sector information subsystems overlap.</p>

<center>
<img src="p228Fig2.gif" width="650" height="384" alt="fig2" border="0">

</center>

<p>The subsystem of administrative information occupies a <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>position, and there <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>intensive bi-directional exchanges between this and the other three subsystems. But, through their policymaking activity, policymakers interfere with citizens and businesses, which in turn try to influence the course of policymaking by forming pressure groups. Similarly, administrations have to answer to policymakers' agendas and timings, since they have to implement government policies, and have to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>with political and bureaucratic goals that are often conflicting, while simultaneously have to attend to citizens' and businesses' needs.</p>

<p>Figure 3 pictures the linkages among the four subsystems.</p>
<center>
<img src="p228Fig3.gif" width="626" height="421" alt="fig3" border="0">
</center>

<p>What emerges from this picture is that, while the subsystem of administrative information occupies a <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>position, the subsystem of policy information occupies a dominant position. As for the linkage between the subsystem of citizenship information and the subsystem of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>information, in the context of the public sector information system, it is apparently tenuous.</p>

<p>Figure 4 reflects a holistic, dynamic and organic vision of the public sector information system, where the different groups of stakeholders involved are seen as entities (people and organisations) with distinctive <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and playing different <span>roles</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> but not mutually exclusive in what <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>their participation in the different subsystems.</p>

<center>
<img src="p228Fig4.gif" width="626" height="480" alt="fig4" border="0">
</center>

<p>The implications of the systemic approach to public sector information, are: 1) a holistic, open view of the entities and elements involved; 2) the clarification of the role of each of the stakeholder groups; 3) the commitment of each of the stakeholder groups as coproducers of the public sector information, and hence co-responsible, in some way, for the working of the system. </p>

<p>This systemic vision is not immune to <span>criticism</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> When analysing the impact of wiring public organisations, upon the organisations' boundaries and jurisdictions, Bekkers con0ers that from the moment a citizen is connected electronically to the public administration, 'he becomes a part of public administration, in that he is not seen as a autonomous individual, but as an information providing agent' (<a href="#bek02">Bekkers 2002</a>: 75). Bekkers argues that the boundaries between a government organisation and the citizen are a safeguard against the abuse of power, and that these boundaries are blurred when the citizen is included in the organisation of the public administration.</p>

<p>Similarly, it was mentioned before that the corporate citizenship concept is still a work in progress, that there is not yet an <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>deontological basis for claiming that corporations have citizenship responsibilities, or even that the citizenship idea is applicable to corporations. But it was also noticed that the voluntary acceptance by companies of the need to manage their external impacts in association with those affected is becoming <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the working of <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>society. Finally, it was argued that it is less problematic to extend the citizenship idea so as to embrace the metaphor of corporate citizenship if the <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on juridical and political <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of citizenship is dropped in favour of a sociological definition such as that proposed by Turner (<a href="#tur94">1994</a>), as a set of <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>which constitute citizens (or corporations) as competent members of a <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>At this stage, it seems appropriate to underline the key role played by administrations in the public sector information system. Not only are they coproducers of the <span>so-called</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>public sector information (together with the other stakeholder groups) but, as a result of their public mission, they are also responsible for managing the information produced and, in most cases, they remain the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>providers of that same information. On the other hand, their mission is not just to serve the individual or corporate citizen, but also to serve the democratic state. This implies the standardisation of situations, benefits and administrative procedures, since this is one of the <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the democratic state to introduce the equality of treatment that helps to eliminate the asymmetries brought about by the market. It should not be inferred, however, that customised services cannot or should not be aimed at.</p>

<p>Finally, conclusions should be <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>from the clarification of the administrations' role, especially concerning the need for access to appropriate qualifications and resources to enable their staff to accomplish their specific tasks: <em>information management</em> and <em>service provision</em>.</p>

<h2>The principle of coproduction applied to the public sector information system</h2>

<p>Recent trends in development studies have challenged the traditional approach provided by narrow development theories. Theorists of social capital have emphasised that <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>such as trust, <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>norms and interpersonal networks, have economic value. Inkeles (<a href="#ink00">2000</a>) con0ers that social capital is a re0ual category, addressing what was left over by the concepts of material capital and human capital, that there is little consensus as to what should be included in social capital, and quotes Coleman for a satisfactory definition of social capital:</p>

<span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>capital is not a single <span>entity</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> but a variety of different entities having two <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in common: they all consist of some aspect of social structure, and they facilitate certain actions of individuals who are within the structure. Like other forms of capital, it is productive, making possible the achievement of certain ends that would not be attainable in its absence. (<a href="#ink00">Inkeles 2000</a>: 247)
</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, Woolcock (<a href="#woo98">1998</a>) highlights that the structure of the state, the nature and extent of its involvement in civic and corporate life, and the organisation of society altogether constitute the key factors determining whether a country succeeds or fails to develop. Revisionist theories addressing the role of the state have emphasised its importance in the development of citizenship as well as the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>role of public institutions in capitalist development. Moreover, despite the proclamations that the state is in decline because of the changing political and economic character of the information age, the fact is that the full development of the information age potential <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on the state to support and enact its legal frameworks and social structures.</p>

<p>As noted by Evans (<a href="#eva96">1996</a>), the reintroduction of the state as a <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>actor in capitalist development and the trend to treat <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>norms and interpersonal networks as social capital, both forced a broadening of the developmental <span>framework</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> but the two movements were not integrated. <span>Putnam</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#put93">1993</a>) is in favour of synergy, highlighting that a wise policy can encourage social capital formation, and social capital itself enhances the effectiveness of government <span>action</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> He also argues that <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of social organization, such as networks, norms and trust, tend to be self-reinforcing and cumulative. When analysing the "economic involution" in the coal and timber industries in Russia, Burawoy (<a href="#bur96">1996</a>) found that trying to construct markets without reconstructing public institutions produced results as negative as those produced by the previous political regime. In China, however, synergistic relations between the state and private enterprises provided the basis for a dynamic transition to a market-oriented economy.</p>

<p>Ostrom (<a href="#ost96">1996</a>) defines coproduction as "the process through which inputs used to produce a good or service are contributed by individuals who are not "in" the same organisation" (p. 1073) and adds that coproduction implies that citizens can play an active role in producing public goods and services that are important to them. Based on <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>results in the field of urban governance, she argues that the production of a service, as contrasted to a good, is difficult without the active participation of those receiving the service. Specific examples are given, in the areas of police services in metropolitan areas ('if citizens do not report suspicious events rapidly to a police department, there is little that department can do to reduce crime in an area or <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the crimes that <span>occur</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>) and educational services ('if <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>are not actively engaged in their own <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> encouraged and <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by their family and friends, what teachers do may make little difference in the skills <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>acquire').</p>

<p>This <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is of great importance, because it is based on strong <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>evidence, and because it questions the principle of the separation between the state and the citizen, as formulated by Bekkers (<a href="#bek02">2002</a>), for the specific context of <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>with the public administration, already examined in section five of this paper.</p>

<p>Research in the field of development studies <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to be enlightening, as it <span>raises</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>questions relating to how synergies are structured and how the surrounding socio-cultural-political context constrains or facilitates the emergence of synergy (<a href="#put93">Putnam 1993</a>; <a href="#eva96">Evans 1996</a>; <a href="#bur96">Burawoy 1996</a>). On the other hand, studies on the impact of cultural <span>values</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> such as Hofstede's (<a href="#hof80">1980</a>, <a href="#hof91">1991</a>), have raised awareness to the importance of soft, elusive and long-standing factors that shape individual <span>minds</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and entire societies. When analysing key differences between weak and strong uncertainty avoidance societies, Hofstede (<a href="#hof91">1991</a>: 134) argues that in weak uncertainty avoidance societies, citizens trust the institutions and civil servants have a positive opinion about the political system. While in strong uncertainty avoidance societies, citizens do not trust the institutions and civil servants have a negative opinion about the political system.</p>

<p>Contributions from the field of policy studies (<a href="#oec01">OECD 2001</a>) <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that engaging citizens in policymaking is a core element of good governance, and contributes to building public trust in government, raising the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of democracy and strengthening civic capacity. Because of its <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>interest for the problem at stake, this study deserves a more <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis. The OECD's vision of citizens' involvement encompasses three levels:</p>

<ol type="a">
<p>a)	<em>Access to information</em>, <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as a basic precondition and defined as a "one-way relationship covering both passive access to information upon demand by citizens and active measures by government to disseminate information to citizens". It is con0ered that access to information <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>citizens to know and understand their rights and to be able to act upon them;</p>

<p>b)	<em>Consultation</em>, <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to policymaking and defined as a 'two-way relationship in which citizens provide feedback to government... Governments define the issues for consultation, set the questions and manage the process, while citizens are invited to contribute their views and opinions';</p>

<p>c)	Active <em>participation</em>, <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as a new frontier, is regarded as a 'relation based on partnership with government, in which citizens actively engage in defining the process and content of policymaking. It acknowledges equal standing for citizens in <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the agenda, proposing policy options and shaping the policy dialogue, although the responsibility for the final decision or policy formulation rests with government' (<a href="#oec01">OECD 2001: 23</a>).</p>
</ol>

<p>At this stage, it seems appropriate to remind Miller's argument that the coordination of the complex processes of <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>societies 'may <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>more channel and net processing, particularly the operation of feedback loops, which facilitate processes that reduce <span>error</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> (<a href="#mil95">Miller 1995</a>: 893).</p>

<p>Access to information has been on the political agenda for quite some time, and significant progress has been made on balancing rights of access, protection of privacy and <span>limits</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to official secrecy. But consultation has only recently been recognized as an important element of public policymaking in the majority of the OECD countries, and legal, policy and institutional frameworks are still under development. As for public participation, only a few countries have begun to explore active participation and experience so far is <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to a small number of pilot cases.</p>

<p>A similar vision can be adopted to build the stakeholder approach to the public sector information system, provided that the consultation/participation <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is carefully shaped. While referring to the narrower context of electronic government, Milner wisely reminds us that end users tend to be constrained in their ability to imagine alternative <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of public services delivery, since their <span>mental</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>parameters</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>were shaped by their present and past experiences. Milner is in fact addressing a research dichotomy, 'that between the need to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>up the citizen, whilst at the same time acknowledging the <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that the individual is likely to have in conceptualising service delivery methodologies that are <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>from existing mindsets and <span>perceptions</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>. (<a href="#mil02">Milner 2002</a>: 67). Milner advocates the use of scenario-based <span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> a resource intensive methodology, not very likely to be adopted by administrations struggling with cost reductions.</p>

<p>As for the public officials who operate the administrative complex, Milner stresses the pivotal role that they should play in the re-engineering of the public services, especially in what <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>access and delivery <span>mechanisms</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Among the guiding principles for successful involvement of citizens, the OECD report (<a href="#oec01">2001</a>) mentions the availability of resources, arguing that adequate financial, human and technical resources are needed, if public information, consultation and active participation in policy-making are to be effective. It is also argued that government officials must have access to appropriate skills, guidance and training as well as an organizational culture that supports their efforts.</p>

<p>Contrasting with the important investments in technology within the public administrations of many of the EU member states, little investment seems to have been made in training and motivating their respective human resources. Milner says that the information industry may be dictating the <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of change in society, 'in ways in which few policy makers have <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>grasped' (<a href="#mil02">Milner 2002</a>: 65). She also admits that social exclusion can be exacerbated rather than alleviated as a consequence of uncoordinated and poorly focused investments in the achievement of electronic government. Finally, Correia notes the gap between indicators of information and communication technology penetration and other indicators of social development, highlighting that 'the ordinary citizen seems to have been caught between the market pressures and the political rethorics concerning the need to catch up with information and communication technologies in order to speed up the process of transition to an information society' (<a href="#cor03">Correia 2003</a>: 229).</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The <span>principal</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>argument of this paper is that the public sector information system comprises different stakeholders who can engage in a <em>co-operative behaviour</em>, as part of a mutually beneficial scheme of co-operation, even though the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and scope of co-operation may vary substantially.</p>

<p>To finalise this discussion, it seems appropriate to return to the notion of the <em>degree of coercion required to implement stakeholding</em>. The issue at stake here is how to enforce the stakeholders' commitment to the public sector information system. In fact, it will be the context that dictates the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of enforcement needed. Societies with high levels of social capital, where positive relations exist between the state and society, will <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>need little more than <em>exhortation</em> and the incentive of <em>best practice</em> dissemination, or the adoption of <em>codes of conduct</em>. But societies with low levels of social capital, where negative relations exist between the state and society, will need not only to adopt <em>codes of conduct</em> but also <em>directives</em>, and possibly <em>legal entrenchment</em> of stakeholder rights and duties.</p>

<p>The success in the adoption of the model proposed (its transformation from a conceptual system into a socio-technical system) might <span>depend</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> therefore, on pre-existing <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and conditions of each socio-political context, including existing levels of <em>social capital</em>, as much as on the implementation of <em>technology</em> to improve public service delivery. However, even though the building of social capital and the development of state-society positive relations take a long time to evolve, it is possible to build <em>synergistic relations</em> in a relatively short run, through an imaginative application of "soft technologies" (Evans, 1996), including institution-building and organisational change.</p>

<p>Finally, it is important to bear in mind that public innovation projects demand above all the <em>redesign of organisational processes</em> and the injection of new <em>administrative resources</em> and <em>technical competence</em> into the organisations. This is particularly true for innovation projects regarding information resource management in the public sector, where investments in technology <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>do not pay off because they are not backed and adequately <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by the redesign of organisational processes and by the development of individual competencies.</p>

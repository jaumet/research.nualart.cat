<h1><font color="#FF0000">INFORMATION FOR REFEREES</font></h1>

<p>Information Research uses a response form to collect its information from referees, but encourages general comments on the paper presented. In making those comments we expect you to consider the following questions (although not necessarily in this order):</p>

<p>Is the subject of the paper a sufficiently significant issue or problem to warrant publication?</p>

<p>Is the argument soundly presented, supported by appropriately analysed data and effectively organized?</p>

<p>Are the conclusions supported by the research findings?</p>

<p>If statistical analysis is employed, are the methods appropriate to the nature of the data?  If any other mathematical methods are used, are they used correctly and presented effectively?</p>

<p>Are there particular reasons why electronic publication is appropriate and has the paper been designed to take advantage of electronic publication?</p>

<p>Are the citations given up-to-date, and do they give a reasonably complete background to the research reported?  Are there any significant omissions?</p>

<p>Are the title and abstract sufficiently informative and appropriate for the paper?</p>

<p>Over all, is the paper interesting, effectively presented and potentially useful?</p>

<p>Which area of potential readership of Information Research does the paper address?</p>

							<p>Thank you for your help</p>

<h1>An action research approach to curriculum development</h1>
<h4>Phil Riding, Sue Fowell and <a href="mailto:p.levy@shef.ac.uk">Phil Levy</a><br>Department of Information Studies<br>University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK</h4><br>

<h2>Computer-supported collaborative work and learning</h2>

<p>A new research group has recently been established in the
Department, focusing upon electronic  support for collaborative learning
and work.  In the area of computer-supported collaborative  learning
(CSCL), we are exploring and developing new pedagogic models for
learning, using  electronic support and learner-centred approaches.  For
example, our current activities involve the  exploitation of appropriate
technology to support open and distance learning, and the design of 
curricula based upon constructivist and experiential learning principles
(<a name="duffy"></a><a href="#duffyt">Duffy & Jonassen, 1992</a>; <a name="duffy"
></a><a href="#kolbd">Kolb, 1984</a>).   The research  group supports
departmental teaching and learning innovations as well as pursuing its
wider  research agenda.  In the area of computer-supported collaborative
work (CSCW), we are  interested in the changing contexts for
collaborative work offered by new technologies, from both  managerial
and social-psychological perspectives.  The British Library has recently
awarded the  group a grant to undertake a sixteen-month project entitled
Communicating Effectively in the  Networked Library.</p>

<h2>Action research</h2>

<p>Action research into our own teaching practice is an important
source of learning for the group.   Here, we describe the nature of
action research, and describe its use in the on-going development  and
evaluation of a new undergraduate module. We hope to show that an action
research  approach to teaching can be used to improve teaching and
learning practice.</p>

<p>Action research has been used in many areas where an understanding
of complex social situations  has been sought in order to improve the
quality of life. Among these are industrial, health and  community work
settings.  Kurt Lewin, often cited as the originator of action research
(<a name="mckernan"></a><a href="#mckernanj">McKernan, 1991</a>), used
 the methodology in his work with people affected by post-war social
problems.  Action research  approaches to educational research were
adopted in the late 60s and early 70s by the ‘teacher- researcher’
movement in the secondary education sector.  This sought to bring the
practising  classroom teacher into the research process as the most
effective person to identify problems and  to find solutions.</p>

<p>We believe that an action research approach can contribute very
positively to activity within the  tertiary sector concerned with
teaching quality issues, and with national Teaching Quality  Assessment
initiatives.  As "reflective practitioners" (<a name="schon"></a><a href="#schond" name=" "
>Schon,1983</a>), we can achieve greater ownership of the  evaluative
process by becoming systematically self-assessing, alongside, and
feeding into,  external assessment processes:</p>

<blockquote>"Through systematic, controlled action research, higher
education teachers can become  more professional, more interested in
pedagogical aspects of higher education and more  motivated to integrate
their research and teaching interests in a holistic way.  This, in turn,
 can lead to greater job satisfaction, better academic programmes,
improvement of student  learning and practitioner’s insights and
contributions to the advancement of knowledge in  higher education."
<address>(Zuber-Skerritt, 1982: 15)</address>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite progress in understanding of the way in which people learn
and the design of learning  environments, teaching practice in higher
education often remains unaffected.  Traditionally,  lecturers have not
been encouraged to draw upon theoretical developments as a means of 
improving curriculum design and delivery.  However, more recently, a
number of initiatives at  national and local levels have been
established to create the conditions for innovation in these 
activities, and teaching/learning is becoming recognised as a more valid
area of enquiry for  academics across all disciplines, rather than as
the unique preserve of specialists.</p>

<p>Action research methodology offers a systematic approach to
introducing innovations in teaching  and learning.  It seeks to do this
by putting the teacher in the dual role of producer of educational 
theory, and user of that theory.  This is both a way of producing
knowledge about higher  education learning and teaching, and a powerful
way of improving learning and teaching practice.   No separation need be
made between the design and delivery of teaching, and the process of 
researching these activities, thereby bringing theory and practice
closer together.</p>

<p>A variety of forms of action research have evolved (<a name="carr"></a><a href="#carrw"
>Carr &amp; Kemmis, 1986</a>) .  All adopt a methodical, iterative  approach
embracing problem identification, action planning, implementation,
evaluation, and  reflection.  The insights gained from the initial cycle
feed into planning of the second cycle, for  which the action plan is
modified and the research process repeated (Figure 1).</p>

<p><img src="diagr1.gif"></p>

<p><a name="kolb"></a><a href="#kolbd">Kolb (1984)</a>  extended this
model to offer a conception of the action research cycle as a learning 
process, whereby people learn and create knowledge by critically
reflecting upon their own  actions and experiences, forming abstract
concepts, and testing the implications of these concepts  in new
situations.  Practitioners can create their own knowledge and
understanding of a situation  and act upon it, thereby improving
practice and advancing knowledge in the field.</p>

<p>Action research has a number of further distinctive features, as
described by <a name="zuber"></a><a href="#zubers">Zuber-Skerritt,
(1982)</a>.    For her, action research is:</p>

<ul><li><i>Critical </i>collaborative enquiry by</li>
<li><i>Reflective </i>practitioners who are</li>
<li><i>Accountable </i> in making the results of their enquiry public,</li>
<li><i>Self-evaluative </i> in their practice, and engaged in</li>
<li><i>Participative </i>problem-solving and continuing professional
development.</li></ul>

<p>According to this view, action research is critical in the sense
that practitioners not only look for  ways to improve their practice
within the various constraints of the situation in which they are 
working, but are also critical change agents of those constraints, and
of themselves.  It is  reflective in that participants analyse and
develop concepts and theories about their experiences.   Action
researchers are accountable in that they aim to make their learning
process and its results  public, both to each other and to other
interested practitioners, using accessible terminology.   Their practice
is self-evaluated in that the reflective and analytical insights of the
researcher- practitioners themselves form the basis of the developmental
process.  Action research is  participative in that those involved
contribute equally to the inquiry, and collaborative in that the 
researcher is not an expert doing research from an external perspective,
but a partner working  with and for those affected by the problem and
the way in which it is tackled.</p>

<h2>Curriculum Development</h2>

<p>We have decided to take a group-based action research approach to
the development of an  introductory undergraduate module on the use of
computer-mediated communications, entitled  Elements of Information
Management: communicating effectively in the networked organisation.  
This activity has been supported by funding from Sheffield University
Curriculum Development  Fund, enabling one of us to devote time to
formalising a suitable action research approach.  We  hope to develop a
model based upon our experience which will be transferable to other 
curriculum development initiatives.</p>

<p>Our curriculum design seeks to address two major objectives in
undergraduate education: firstly,  to enable students to experience
"deep" learning; and secondly, to facilitate the development of 
transferable skills.  It has long been recognised that traditional
teaching techniques often fail to  encourage "deep" learning of subject
content, which goes beyond short-term rote memorisation to  enable the
assimilation of new knowledge in a way which allows re-application to
novel  situations (<a name="entwhistle"></a><a href="#entwhistlen">Entwhistle,
1988</a>).  Strategies to develop transferable skills in areas such as
thinking and learning,  self-management, communication, group work and
information management, are intended to  prepare students for work
outside of the academic contexts in which they are learned initially.</p>

<p>The teaching strategy we have decided upon uses experiential and
constructivist learning  principles (<a name="duffy2"></a><a href="#duffyt"
>Duffy & Jonassen, 1992</a>;<a name="kolb2"></a> <a href="#kolbd">Kolb,1984</a>;
<a name="boud"></a> <a href="#boudd">Boud, et al., 1985</a>).  For
much of the module, students are engaged in a group-based collaborative 
project supported by the use of computer-mediated communication
technologies such as  electronic mail, asynchronous conferencing and
synchronous chat.  This is complemented by a  range of
individually-based learning activities.  Students are provided with a
range of on-line  information resources, and have access to tutor
support via electronic mail and face-to-face  meetings as necessary.  A
major issue for us as action researchers is to come to an understanding 
of the nature and level of support required by students to gain the most
from their learning  activities.  A key question associated with this
is: what is the necessary balance between  externally-imposed structure
and control and the students freedom to be self-directed?</p>

<p>A number of features of the way we have decided to work on this
module mark the approach as  being one of action research:</p>

<p><i>We aim to apply the model offered by the action research cycle.</i></p>

<p>Although not yet complete, the development of the module is
following the action research cycle  illustrated earlier.  By completion
of the first cycle, we will have:</p>

<ul><li>identified a number of objectives and formed initial working
hypotheses about meeting them.   For instance, a key objective is to
provide an appropriate framework for deep learning, for  which we
believe it will be necessary to encourage maximum student ownership of
the  learning process;</li>

<li>planned a curriculum model and devised materials and processes to
support it.  For instance, a  key feature of our curriculum model is
students' engagement in collaborative group  project work.  Materials
and processes to support this include process workbooks and  learning
diaries for individual work, process workshops to support positive group
 functioning, and on-line tutor support.</li>
 
<li>put these into practice by running the module.  The module is based
upon one hour of theory  workshop and two hours of project work per
week, over one semester.  The main form of  assessment is by coursework
(the group project), supplemented by individually-produced  learning
diaries.</li>

<li>made observations on our practice and evaluated its effects. 
Evaluation and self-assessment  strategies include a range of on-going
student feedback mechanisms and tutor debriefings.</li>

<li>reflected upon the results of the evaluation, in preparation for
modifying our practice for the  second implementation of the module. 
For instance, at present the choice of focus for  student project work
is relatively limited.  Given that students participating in the module 
come from a very wide diversity of academic disciplines, which are
likely to hold  distinctive perspectives on computer-mediated
communication, we would like to open this  up to greater student choice
in future if appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>We intend that the inquiry is critical in spirit and purpose.</i></p>

<p>We believe that it is useful for our own development to perceive
ourselves as a "critical  community" of practitioners who not only want
to improve the quality of teaching and learning in  higher education
within the constraints and practical considerations imposed upon us, but
who  also seek to be change agents of those constraints.  For instance,
assessment by examination is  traditionally imposed at University level
for this type of module; we anticipate and hope that its  outcomes will
justify the future elimination of this form of assessment in future
implementation.</p>

<p><i>We aim to be reflective and self-evaluating.</i></p>

<p>Insights gained from reflection and analysis of our practice will be
fed back into practice.  There  will be continuous re-assessment of the
module and its structure.  Built into the module are  mechanisms which
remind and encourage us to reflect systematically on our activities. 
For  instance, as tutors we keep a collaborative on-line ‘tutor diary’
in which we share our reflections  on teaching performance, content,
course structure, student response, etc., relating them to prior 
experience and to teaching/learning theory.  Individual experience is
thus made available between  colleagues for comment and analysis, and we
attempt to challenge as well as support each other.   This semi-public
sharing of experience creates a collegial, collaborative approach to our
personal  professional development.</p>

<p><i>We are accountable.</i></p>

<p>We intend to make public the results of our evaluation, and the
process by which it was achieved,  both locally and more widely.</p>

<p><i>We are engaged in participative problem-solving.</i></p>

<p>Those doing the research and those doing the teaching are one and
the same. We have not  employed external evaluators to assess the
module; rather, we work together to gather data during  its development
and implementation which will then be analysed collectively, taking
account of  the point of view of each of us.  We believe that reporting
of the project should similarly embrace  all points of view, and reports
will be jointly written.</p> 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We do not expect to achieve a cut-and-dried solution to the
objectives we have identified, and we  are not concerned with producing
a strictly generalisable model of learning or teaching.   However, we do
hope that fellow practitioners will find our experiences useful, both as
an  example of action research and as a curriculum model.  We would
welcome communication with  others working in similar ways on curriculum
development within the field of information  studies.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> This paper describes a  research project in the Department of
Information Studies at Sheffield  University.   The research focuses on
the Information Systems Strategy (ISS) Formation in UK  Higher Education
Institutions (HEI's) with specific reference to information strategies. 
 Information strategies, for the purpose of this research being seen as
a sub-set of an Information  systems strategy.   This research holds
interest on two levels, first the topic of research, and  secondly the
methodological approach which will be tested.   Most HEI's in the United
Kingdom  are currently developing information strategies.   The impetus
for this development coming both  from internal pressures, but also
significantly from the HEFCE's.   Unfortunately there is very  little
information available on information systems strategies in HEI's or on
information  strategies.   The research, it is hoped, will in some way
address this imbalance.
</p>
<h2><b>Aim Of Research</b></h2>
<p> As has already been noted, literature reviewed on the subject of
information systems strategy  (ISS) formulation can be seen to focus on
private rather than public organisations and particularly  on the
financial sector (cf Walsham and Waema, in press).   The small amount of
literature which  is available on information systems or information
strategy  issues in HEI's tends to take a  functionalist, mechanistic,
deterministic approach focusing on the IT aspect almost to the 
exclusion of all others.
</p>
<p> This gap in the literature has practical consequences because HEI's
are now  developing  information strategies.   The impetus for this is
coming from, on the one hand,  internal factors  such as the reduction
of resources and increasing student numbers.   On the other hand,
external  factors, such as a change in orientation of the main funding
body from information technology  strategies to information systems and
information strategies and its pressure for their  development are also
playing an important role.   In this changing environment the
information  systems (IS) strategy has taken on a new importance as
HEI's realise that they need to plan  strategically the gathering,
storage and dissemination of their information resources.   The ability 
to form one effectively is thus of central concern for Universities and
there is an according need  for research in this area.   With Joint
Information Systems Committee guidelines due in July 1995  and academic
strategies (which must make reference to the Universities' information
strategies)  due in April 1995, many of the stake-holders interviewed in
Institutions of Higher Education  have expressed concern over this lack
of information about both what an information systems  strategy (ISS) or
information strategy (IS) is and how they go about forming one. 
</p>
<h2><b>Definition of terms</b></h2>
<p>One of the fundamental issues facing  the researcher in the field of
information systems is the  ambiguity and proliferation of terminology. 
 This 'problem' stems from the multi-disciplinary  (<a name="achterb"></a><a href="#achter"
>Achterberg et al., 1991</a>) identify thirty-two disciplines related to
the IS field !) and youthful  nature of IS research, and is one which is
exacerbated by time rather than being resolved.    <a href="#repo">Reponen
(1993)</a>,<a name="reponen"></a> for example, points out that more
than eight distinct terms can be identified  surrounding the 'single'
concept of strategic information systems.  <a href="#boaden">Boaden and
Lockett (1990)</a> <a name="boadenx"></a> argue that not only are the
terms unclear but that "the relationship between the terms IT, IS and 
IM" are unclear.   This is further compounded, for this research, by the
fact that there is little  literature available on IS strategy in the
public sector, and that the literature on IS, or IM issues in 
Institutions of Higher Education in the UK is limited to only a few
articles (e.g., <a href="#anders">Anderson, 1992</a>; <a name="anderson">
</a> <a href="#rosner">Rosner 1991</a>). <a name="rosnerx"></a>   
</p>
<p>The problem of ambiguity has been resolved, for the purpose of this
research, by the adaptation  of  definitions and concepts developed in
the  literature on the private sector.   Although <a>King  (1982)</a>
<a name="kingx"></a> argued that private sector concepts can be
directly transferred, it is not proposed to do so,  directly, in this
research, although they can be seen as a useful starting point.   The
first target of  this research, therefore, is to define the terms to be
used and to define the relationships between  the terms used.   The
function of a IS strategy itself is best described by <a href="#wilson" name=" "
>Wilson (1989)
</a><a name="wilsont"></a>states that:  </p>
<blockquote>"An information systems strategy brings together the
business aims of the company, an  understanding of the information
needed to support those aims, and the implementation of  computer
systems to provide that information.   It is a plan for the development
of  systems towards some future vision of the role of information
systems in the  organisation."
</blockquote>
<p> This definition is qualified by <a href="#repo">Reponen (1993)
</a><a name="repo2"></a>who argues that:</p>
<blockquote>"An IS strategy is something which is essentially a planing
process in the minds of the  decision makers, users and developers of
the systems.   It is supported with written reports  and plans, but they
are of secondary importance."
</blockquote>
<p>The conceptual framework used for the definition of the components
of an information strategy  and the relationship between them will be
taken from <a href="#galliersa">Galliers (1991, 1993)</a><a name="galliersx"
></a>.   This approach takes  an holistic, socio-technical stance,
rather than the traditional mechanistic approach which places  most
emphasis on the information technology aspect of the information system.
  Galliers states  that the IS strategy has four distinct components:
the  information strategy, the information  technology strategy, the
information management strategy and the change management/ 
implementation strategy.  </p>
<p><i>The Information Strategy</i> </p>
<p>The  information strategy acts as the linchpin between the  academic
strategy and the IS strategy.    It answers the questions: what
information is required? and where is the information required  to 
support the primary tasks, or key goals, of the  academic strategy.   It
also  questions the  appropriateness of the  critical assumptions behind
the  academic strategy in light of the changing  environment and
changing perceptions.   This assessment and review process is one of the
core  concepts behind this model.   Thus, for Galliers, strategy should
have both deterministic and  emergent elements.     </p>
<p> <i>The Information Technology Strategy</i></p>
<p> The  information technology strategy is, for Galliers, of secondary
importance: it is concerned  with applications and platforms, the 'nuts
and bolts' of how to provide the information.   Thus, it  is concerned
with the technological infrastructure necessary to fulfil the
requirements of the  information strategy.
</p>
<p><i>The Information Management Strategy </i> </p>
<p>The Information Management Strategy is concerned with how the
information services are  organised for the different facets of the
Institution (i.e., centralised, distributed, out-sourced) and  policy
issues such as who gets access and what level of access they receive. 
</p>
<p> <i>The Change Management/ Implementation Strategy</i></p>
<p>The Change Management/ Implementation Strategy will identify what
organisational change will  be needed for the information systems
strategy to be successful and when it will be implemented  and by whom. 
 Importantly, those who will implement the strategy should be involved
in its  formulation and specific plans and budgets should be drawn into
the process here.     </p>
<p><img src="dallen.gif"></p>
<p>In the course of the research the following issues have been raised:
</p>
<ul><li>Is there a relationship between the content of an information
strategy and how it is  conceptualised?  Sub-questions within this are: 
What is an IS strategy perceived to be?  (i)  Can the information
strategy be viewed as a linchpin between the 'academic' strategy and IS 
strategy?  (ii) What role does the information strategy play in the
formulation of the  information systems strategy? 
</li>
<li>How does organisational culture effect the process of ISS
formulation.    Organisational culture  has been classified by a number
of researchers, the most influential of whom in the  information systems
field has been <a href="#mintzb">Mintzberg (1978)</a>,<a name="mintzbergx">
</a> whose model has been used most  recently by <a name="jordanx"></a><a href="#jordan"
>Jordan (1994)</a>.
</li>
<li>Is there any noticeable  relationship between the power position of
those who initiated the IS  strategy formulation process and its
perceived success?  This is seen as perhaps the core  research question,
as ISS formulation is seen as primarily a political process:  thus, <a href="#keen"
>Keen  (1981)</a> <a name="keenx"></a>states " Information Systems
increasingly alter relationships, patterns of  communication and
perceived influence, authority and control".   Sub-questions within this
 issue will be: (i).   An analysis of the groups or coalitions who
participated in the  formulation of the strategy within the institution.
  This attempts to address the point made  by <a name="breaksx"></a><a href="#breaks"
>Breaks (1991)</a>:   "As long as IS strategies are being driven solely
by Directors of  Computer Centres and Librarians, they will remain
marginal to the concerns of the majority  in the University and will be
seen as little more than special pleading".   (ii) Was there  consensus
or conflict during the formulation process?  How (if at all)  did this
relate to the  perceived success of the strategy formulation process? 
The key issue that this question  wishes to address is the relationship
between organisational  conflict and innovation.   The  hypothesis that
high levels of conflict in an organisation  can be positive (because of
the  inverse relationship between consensus and high performance) will
be analysed.
</li>
<li>The relationship between the process of IS strategy formulation its
success will be analysed.    Success will be defined by variables
suggested by  the different stake-holders/coalitions, as  used by
<a href="#galliersa">Galliers (1991)</a> <a name="galliers2"></a>and
suggested by <a href="#fitzg">Fitzgerald (1993)</a>. <a name="fitzger"></a>
 These will be gathered during  the qualitative research process.  
Success is taken to be a subjective issue and, therefore,  perceptions
will be gathered and analysed.   Psychometric tests (as used by <a name="baroudix"
></a><a href="#baroundi">Baroundi and Orlikowski, 1988</a>) will not be
used.
</li></ul>
<h2><b>Theoretical Position</b></h2>
<p>The current theoretical position in IS research is one, as <a href="#visala"
>Visala (1991)</a><a name="visalax"></a> points out, of  fragmentation
and uncoordination.   Cumulative traditions are rare and the field is
divided into a  number of different schools and trends.   The
communication between these different schools has  been based mainly on
a aggressive refutation of each others' theories (cf. <a href="#olaisen">
Olaisen, (1991)</a><a name="olaisenx"></a>.   As  already noted, a key
distinguishing feature of this debate is a confusion over basic terms,
such as  Information System, (<a href="#fitzg">Fitzgerald, 1993</a>);<a name="fitzger2"
></a>  thus, many of the protagonists seem to talk 'past' each  other
rather than to each other.    This has been linked to the mutually
exclusive nature of the  paradigms within which the different
researchers work.   A parallel debate within the IS field  relates to
the choice of methodology.   This has been explicitly linked to the
paradigm debate   (<a href="#galliersb">Galliers, 1991</a><a name="galliers3"
></a>; <a href="#ngwen">Ngwenyama, 1991</a><a name="ngwenx"></a>).  
However,  others (e.g., <a href="#kraemer">Kraemer and Dutton, 1991</a>)<a name="kraemerx"
></a> still  consider it a matter for internal debate within the
paradigm.   All agree, however, that the basic  philosophical principles
behind the research dictate the method used (cf. <a href="#antill">Antill,
1991</a>)<a name="antillx"></a>.    It is  considered important,
therefore, to relate the research design to be used within the context
of IS  research.  </p>
<p> A number of frameworks have been used in the analysis of
information systems research.    Predominant have been, the work of <a href="#burrell"
>Burrell and Morgan (1979)</a><a name="burrellx"></a>, <a href="#wood">Wood-Harper
(1984)</a><a name="woodhx"></a>,<a href="#klein">Klein and Lyytinen
(1984)</a><a name="kleinx"></a> and <a href="#iivari">Iivari (1991)</a><a name="ivariix"
></a>.   All of these researchers have suggested that four  paradigms
can be identified, which Burrell and Morgan label as, Functionalism,
Radical  Humanism,  Radical Structuralism, and Interpretative.   These
paradigms, they argue, can be  analysed on four dimensions:  ontology,
human nature, epistemology and methodology.   The  framework, however,
is explicitly a loose one, as they argue, "We advocate our scheme as a 
heuristic device rather than a rigid set of definitions".   Without
doubt, the two dominant  paradigms in the field are the Interpretative
and the Functionalist.   <a href="#han">Han and Jones (1993)</a><a name="hanx"
></a>, among  others, have advanced the view that there is a new body of
research developing in the field which  takes a more pragmatic stance.  
 This research has integrated concepts across paradigmatic  boundaries. 
 As
<a>Orlikowski (1992)</a> <a></a>states:
</p>
<blockquote>"The early work assumed technology to be an objective
external force that would have  relatively deterministic impacts on
organisational properties such as structure.   In  contrast, a later
group of researchers focused on the human action aspect of the 
technology seeing it more as  a product of shared interpretations or
interventions.   The  third and more recent work on technology has
reverted to a 'soft' determinism where  technology is posited as an
external force having impacts but where the impacts are  moderated by
human actors and organisational contexts"
</blockquote>
<p>This research falls into the third group, based upon Structuration
Theory, which was developed  by <a href="#giddens">Giddens (1976)</a><a name="giddensx"
></a> and which has been identified as one of the most fruitful
approaches to IS  research.   <a href="#walshama">Walsham and Han,
(1990)</a><a></a>, argue that  "...structuration theory is of high
potential as a  theoretical basis for the generation of descriptions of
the IS strategy formulation process...".     <a href="#orlik">Orlikowski
 (1992)</a><a></a>, 
<a href="#walshama">Walsham and Han (1990)</a><a></a> and <a href="#jones"
>Jones and Nandhakumar (1992)</a><a></a> have used  this theory to
research IS issues.</p>
<p> The debate surrounding the use of both qualitative and quantitative
research methodologies in a  single research design has been
spluttering, in the social sciences, since the idea was raised by 
<a href="#camp">Campbell and Fiske (1959)</a><a></a>.   Many, in both
the functionalist and interpretative, camps argue that  their can be no
combination of methods.   The debate has been initially based on the
view that  those using qualitative methods tended to see quantitative
methods as invalid and vice versa, so  the combination of methods was
seen as a pointless exercise.   Another major argument against 
combination of methods was that they were mutually exclusive (e.g., <a href="#burrell"
>Burrell and Morgan, 1979</a>).
<a></a></p>
<p>Qualitative and quantitative research are seen as being based in
mutually exclusive paradigms,  each paradigm having different
ontological, methodological, epistemological perspectives and  different
views about human nature, each facet fitting into each other to form a
complete whole,  as pieces in a jigsaw.    It is this belief in
incommensurability, either explicit or more oftenly  implicit and
assumed, which has formed the critical argument against any synthesis,
integration  or any form of unity between any aspect of the paradigms.  
A number of researchers have  produced  methodologically pluralistic
approaches.   However, these have been based on a  practical synthesis
rather than any form of theoretical synthesis.   They have argued that,
in spite  of their mutually exclusive nature, aspects from different
paradigms can be combined in one  research design (e.g., <a></a>Wildermuth
(1993)). <a></a>  So, from this perspective, research methods from 
different paradigms can be used simultaneously or consecutively and are
equally valid.   Five  purposes for combining methods in a single study
have been put forward from this perspective.     <a></a>Creswell (1994)<a>
</a>  argues that these are, first, triangulation in order to neutralise
bias and  triangulation in the classic sense of seeking convergence of
results.   Secondly, that the two  approaches are seen as complementary
in that, by their use, overlapping and different facets of  the
phenomenon may emerge.   Alternatively, the approaches may be used
developmentally,  where the first method is used to help inform the
second method.    He also suggests that a  combined approach may be used
to bring out contradictions and fresh perspectives.   Finally, he 
argues that  it may be used to add scope and breadth to a study.    
</p>
<p>A key argument against pluralism has been the fact that there can be
no communication across  paradigms (<a></a>Burrell and Morgan, 1979).
<a></a> Because linguistic symbols take on different meanings  across
paradigms there can be no possibility of direct translation from one
paradigm to another.     <a></a>Weaver and Gioia (1994)<a></a>on the
other hand argue that, "although there may be errors of  comprehension
and failures of communication ... there is no reason to believe that
such  difficulties are endemic  to theoretical , meta-theoretical  and
methodological debates".  </p>
<p>The most theoretically advanced conceptual model of how these
mutually exclusive paradigms  can be combined has been produced by <a></a>Gioia
and Pitre (1990),<a></a> who attempted to build bridges  across
paradigm boundaries via the concept of transition zones between the
paradigms.   This  approach was later rejected by <a></a>Weaver and
Gioia (1994).<a></a>   This research will draw upon  Giddens’s
Structuration Theory, as used by Weaver and Gioia, which offers a 
sophisticated solution to the problem of the irreconcilable nature of 
paradigms and, therefore, of  qualitative and quantitative
methodologies.   It will not be used as a complete research  programme,
but its meta-theoretical status, combined with its focus on ontological
issues, allows  its use as the keystone of a theoretically-based,
pluralistic approach.     </p>
<h2><b>Methodology </b></h2>
<p>The methodology has two distinct phases, the first phase
quantitative and the second qualitative.    The sample size for the
first phase of the research is twelve organisations.    Within each 
organisation a minimum of eight key stake-holders in the strategy
formulation process will be  identified.   This phase of the research
will be longitudinal, and the stakeholders have hence been  interviewed
on a number of occasions.   Over 100 interviews have been conducted so
far.   For  the second phase the potential sample size will be every HEI
in the UK.     </p>
<p>Information has been, and will continue to be gathered throughout
the project,  to place the  process being observed in context, by the
use of  interviews with key external bodies determining  the external
environment within which HEI's develop ISS's.   Key academics involved
in the  research of IS planning will also be interviewed.  </p>
<p>The first methodological tool which is being applied to this sample
in the first phase is semi- structured interview, and observation from
which case studies are being developed.   The case  studies developed in
phase one will then be used to augment and expand upon existing theory
to  develop a questionnaire.   This will be piloted, using the sample
already identified in qualitative  research and eighteen other
organisations.   This will bring the pilot sample to thirty, which is 
sufficient to discover any major flaws in the questionnaire.  The second
data-gathering instrument  will be a structured questionnaire.   The 
small size of the actual population means that the  questionnaire can 
be given in all the organisations to at least three key stake-holders or
coalition  leaders.  </p>
<h2><b>Conclusions</b></h2>
<p> Currently, phase one of the data collection is near completion and
phase two will be started in  late February or early March.  
Preliminary and general results from phase one will be presented  at the
SCONUL conference in March in Aberdeen.

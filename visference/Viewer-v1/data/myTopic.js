var QUERY = "Current Bayesian models for dynamic social network data have focused on modelling the influence of evolving unobserved structure on observed social interactions However an understanding of how observed social relationships from the past affect future unobserved structure in the network has been neglected In this paper we introduce a new probabilistic model for capturing this phenomenon which we call latent feature propagation in social networks We demonstrate our modelâ€™s capability for inferring such latent structure in varying types of social network datasets and experimental studies show this structure achieves higher predictive performance on link prediction and forecasting tasks ";

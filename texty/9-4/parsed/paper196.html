<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>New Zealand's political parties, like those in other developed countries, 
have increasingly adopted the Internet as a communication and information tool. 
With the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of the World Wide Web and graphical browsers in the mid 
1990s, the Internet has become widely accessible, and not surprisingly, most 
political parties now <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>a Website as a necessary campaign tool. In the 
words of one commentator, &quot;Cyberspace has become the virtual equivalent of Hyde 
Park corner&quot; (<a href="#Norris">Norris 2001</a>).</p>

<p>There is much debate about whether political parties are <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>full 
advantage of the <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>offered by the Internet. Gibson and Ward(<a 
href="#Gibson2000">2000</a>), for example, identified five ways in which the WWW can enhance communication for political parties when compared to traditional media:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of information can be increased; </li>
  <li>the speed of communicating can be increased; </li>
  <li>the format of communicating can be any (or all) of audio, video and text; </li>
  <li>the <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of information and communication flows (ICFs) can be one-way 
  or two-way, upward , downward or lateral and the WWW can greatly enhance all 
  types of interactive communication<sup><a href="#Footnote1">1</a></sup>; and,</li> 
  <li>the control over communicating is decentralised allowing individuals to 
  send or receive communications when they want, or to view or even <span>publish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>what 
  they want.</li></ol>
  
<p>It is important, therefore, to evaluate what political parties are doing online and how they are using the Internet, as the <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>has now become a key communication tool for political parties and a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>source of information for 
many people.</p>

<p>In New Zealand, many political parties have created an online presence. 
Indeed, the number of political parties in New Zealand increased when the Mixed 
Member Proportional Representation (MMP) system of government was <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>as 
the result of a referendum in 1993. New Zealand's MMP system is based on the 
German model which allows for greater <span>representation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in Parliament of minor 
parties. Each citizen has two votes in an election - an electorate vote, for the 
candidate you most want to <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>your local electorate in Parliament, and a 
party vote, for the party you most want to be <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in Parliament (<a 
href="#ElectoralCommission">New Zealand Electoral Commission 2002</a>). In total, New Zealand's Parliament has 120 seats, with sixty-nine electorate seats and fifty-one party seats. Three elections have 
been <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in New Zealand since the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of MMP, in 1996, in 1999, and 
the most recent in July 2002, all of which have resulted in minority 
governments. The current government is a coalition of the New Zealand Labour 
Party (fifty-two seats) and the Progressive Coalition (two seats), with support from 
United Future (eight seats) on supply and confidence issues. </p>

<p>This research project focuses on determining <i>how effectively New Zealand 
political parties are using the Internet</i>. More specifically, the research 
examines the purpose of their online presence, in the form of Websites, and how 
effective the Websites are at delivering the functions they are being used for. 
The research problem was <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>into two key questions:</p>


<ul>
  <li><i>"What functions are New Zealand political parties performing 
  online?"</i> By responding to this question, the research has been able to 
  determine whether political parties used their Websites as a way of 
  distributing large quantities of information, and whether they used them as a 
  way of providing information quickly. Also, it has allowed the research to 
  <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>whether the parties were using the Websites to engage in two-way 
  communication with party members and the general public.</li> 
  
  <li><i>"How effectively do the New Zealand political parties' Websites 
  deliver these functions?"</i> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>party may be providing large <span>amounts</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of 
  information on its Website, but if this information is difficult to find, its 
  usefulness will be reduced. Likewise, a Website may offer a high level of 
  interactivity, but if a user cannot access the site it will count for little. 
  So, measuring Website delivery, in terms of factors such as navigability and 
  accessibility, was an important aspect of evaluating the effectiveness of 
  political party Websites.</li></ul>
  
<h2>Literature review</h2>

<p>As Internet use by political parties and candidates has grown, so too has the 
related literature, which has looked both at the reasons for the political 
parties' adoption of the Internet, and the effectiveness of their use of it.</p>

<p>According to Selnow (<a href="#Selnow">1998</a>) political parties and candidates in the United States began to adopt the Internet during election campaigns in 1996. Roper (<a href="#Roper">1998</a>) 
pointed out that most parties did not have a real conception of how to use the 
<span>medium</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> and many of them set up Websites primarily to be seen to be keeping up 
with technology. Selnow <a href="#Selnow">(1998)</a> suggested that parties and candidates also simply feared being left behind. In addition, he <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>that the low cost of using the Internet was an important 
factor in its adoption (79), a point similarly noted by Browning (1996).</p>

<p>Researchers quickly responded to the adoption of the Internet by political parties by <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>criteria to evaluate their Websites. Broadly <span>speaking</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> the criteria were adapted from those used to evaluate general Internet 
resources, in much the same way as criteria used to evaluate Internet resources had been adapted from those used for print material. For example, in an early study of political party Websites, Auty and Nicholas (<a href="#Auty1998">1998</a>) used a general set of criteria similar to that proposed by <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a 
href="#Smith1997">1997</a>). Their rather lengthy <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of criteria did not look at interactivity, an important criterion when con0ering political party Websites. In another early study, Klotz (<a href="#Klotz">1997</a>) took a more quantitative approach, focussing primarily on the content of Web sites rather than their function or <span>design</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> Though this method provided a measurable way to compare the different Websites, much of the data collected 
were personal <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>about candidates, thus <span>limiting</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>the method's <span>utility</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>as a tool for general evaluation.</p>

<p>Following on Auty and Nicholas's <a href="#Auty1998">1998</a> study, Auty and Cowen conducted studies in <a 
href="#Auty2000">2000</a> and <a href="#Auty2001">2001</a> in which they employed a more simplified set of six criteria: content; design; multimedia; currency; external links; and interactivity. The use of the same set 
of criteria in these studies did permit some <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>comparison</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> but the imprecise way in which the criteria were assessed worked against this. For example, in relation to their evaluation of the Website <span>design</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> the researchers 
stated that, &quot;On the whole, aids to navigation were also present on many of the sites.&quot; (<a 
href="#Auty2001">Auty and Cowen 2001</a>).</p>

<p>More recently, Gibson and Ward (<a href="#Gibson2000">2000</a>: 301) noted that in addition to evaluating the Websites as information sources, the studies of political party Websites had a <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>nature since they were 
also <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to find out why, and how effectively, the parties were using the new <span>medium</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> These authors <span>observed</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> &quot;although such studies have <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>very useful in framing the questions that need to be asked about political Websites, they are clearly <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in the extent to which they allow for identification of trends across time, and across countries.&quot; Gibson and Ward proposed adopting a more standardized, quantitative method consisting of 43 evaluation criteria that measure function and delivery (<a href="#Gibson2000">2000</a>: 306-309) and would allow better <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of the Websites (<a href="#Gibson2000">2000</a>: 316). Gibson and Ward (<a href="#Gibson2002">2002</a>) have applied this method in a study of Australian political party Web sites, and in a comparative study of party Websites in the USA and UK during election campaigns (<a href="#Gibson2003">Gibson <em>et al.</em>  2003</a>). Norris (<a href="#Norris">2001</a>) used a similar method, but it had only thirty-two criteria which he split into two categories, &quot;information transparency&quot; and &quot;communication interactivity&quot; and which simply required 'yes/no' answers. This approach is straightforward and provides a simple way of comparing parties within and across countries.</p>

<p>Though quantitative methods can provide more consistent and measurable evaluations of party and candidate Websites, unfortunately they can be based on subjective assumptions or they can <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>the level of detail <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>by <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>approaches. For example, Auty and Cowen (<a href="#Auty2000">2000</a>), regarded the number of times that a candidate was <i>linked to</i> as being more revealing than whether the <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>were <i>up to date</i>. And in their study of Australian political parties, Gibson and Ward (<a href="#Gibson2002">2002</a>) simply counted the number of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>into the parties' Websites to measure and compare their visibility, even though it also would have been valuable to know <i>who was linking into</i> the sites.</p>

<p>Several common themes emerged from the early evaluative studies. Roper (<a href="#Roper">1998</a>), 
Auty and Nicholas (<a href="#Auty1998">1998</a>), and Selnow (<a href="#Selnow">1998</a>) all found that political parties used their Websites like traditional media, <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>little advantage of the new interactive <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>available, and that much of the information provided on the Websites was taken from the parties' standard official material (<a href="#Rommele">Rommele 2003</a>). Gibson and Ward (<a href="#Gibson1997">1997</a>) and Auty and Nicholas (<a href="#Auty1998">1998</a>) <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>that the Internet was being used for top-down dissemination rather than as an interactive <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>for discussion and debate. Roper (<a  href="#Roper1998">1998</a>) and D'Alessio (<a href="#DAlessio">2000</a>) argued the political parties choose to use the Internet this way because real interactivity would open them to negativity and heckling.</p>

<p>Literature examining whether minor parties have benefited from going online have had mixed conclusions. On the one hand, Norris (<a href="#Norris">2001</a>) <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>groups such as minor parties are likely to be among the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>beneficiaries of online politics. On the other hand, other studies have <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>that, overall, <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties are more visible than minor or fringe parties (<a href="#Gibson2002">Gibson and Ward 2002</a>; <a  href="#Gibson2003">Gibson <em>et al.</em>  2003</a>).</p>

<p>To date much of the research on political party Websites has been <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in nature. While providing an interesting picture of the development of these sites, this research does not provide a meaningful way to compare sites or evaluate what parties are doing online and how effectively they are doing it. The more quantitative studies undertaken by Gibson and Ward (<a href="#Gibson2000">2000</a>) and Norris (<a href="#Norris">2001</a>)  provide a method for making such comparisons, not only between <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties, but also across countries and time. For these reasons the method developed by Gibson and Ward has been used, with minor adaptation, in 
this study.</p>

<h2>Research method</h2>

<p>Gibson and Ward's (<a href="#Gibson 2000">2000</a>) study was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to evaluate two <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>aspects of political party Websites, (1) their purpose and function, and (2) their effectiveness in delivering these functions. These researchers used a coding scheme that <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>fifty different criteria numerically, thereby providing for objective evaluation and <span>comparison</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> By adapting Gibson and Ward's (<a href="#Gibson2000">2000</a>) 
quantitative method, the study reported here has both been able to evaluate the effectiveness of New Zealand political party Websites and to make comparisons between countries and across time.</p>

<p>The data required for the current research <span>consisted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>primarily of the contents of New Zealand political party Websites. However, factors such as each party's size and longevity may have <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>the function and effectiveness of the sites; therefore background information about the parties was also collected to provide context. Initially the full <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of registered political parties was obtained from the <a  href="http://www.elections.org.nz/esyst/parties.html">Electoral Commission</a> Website on the 1st December 2002. Three <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>sources were then used to compile a <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of the registered parties that had Websites, including parties <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in Parliament and those that were not:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The &quot;<a 
  href="http://www.elections.org.nz/pandr/links.html" target="_blank">Useful Web Sites</a>&quot; <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>maintained by the Electoral Commission.</li>

  <li>The &quot;<a  href="http://webdirectory.natlib.govt.nz/dir/en/nz/government-law-and-politics/politics/political-parties" target="_blank">Political Parties</a> &quot; <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>on the Te Puna Web directory</li> 

  <li>The <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>included in an article about election resources on the Internet in the July 2002 issue of <i>Library Life</i><sup><a href="#Footnote2">2</a></sup> (<a href="#Fitzsimons">Fitzsimons, 2002</a>). </li></ol>

<p>The contents of the Websites were collected using Teleport Pro <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>and copied on to CDs. This <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>downloadvertisements and creates a copy of a Website on a hard drive. For this study, the captured data provided a 'snapshot' of each Web site, and created a permanent record of each site at that point in time, important con0erations given the changeable nature of information on the Internet. Disseminating information quickly and providing up to date information are key attributes of effective Website use. To ensure these attributes could be <span>observed</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> the contents of the Websites were captured once a week for the month of December, 2002.</p>

<p>To address the first research question<sup><a href="#Footnote3">3</a></sup>, data relating to the <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of ICFs were gathered to determine whether the parties were <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>advantage of the interactive capabilities of the Internet. The data were coded into four <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>categories: (1) downward information flows; (2) upward information flows; (3) lateral/horizontal information flows; and, (4) interactive information flows (further <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>into asynchronous and synchronous). Each category includes a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of more <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>measures. 'Downward information flows' contains the most detail with twenty-two <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>measures, whereas 'interactive information flows: synchronous' contains only two measures and 'upward information flows' contains three. All measures are self-explanatory with the exception of two. 'Who's who' relates specifically to people within the party organisation since the parliamentary wing was covered by the 'leader profile' and 'candidate profiles'. 'Negative campaigning' relates only to items on the Website that were specifically headlined as criticising other parties or were predominantly about other parties. The full coding scheme is provided in <a href="#app1">Appendix 1</a>. The data were coded and entered into a series of Excel spreadvertisementsheets for analysis.</p>

<p>While there was some analysis of individual factors, five composite indices were used for the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>part of the quantitative analysis:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Information provision, by coding the factors measuring 'downward information flows' as present or absent.</li> 
  <li>Resource generation, by combining the factors measuring donation, purchasing, and membership. </li>
  <li>Participation, by coding the following factors as being present or absent: e-mail contacts, feedback opportunities, a bulletin board, a chat room, online debate opportunities. </li>
  <li>Networking, by measuring the number of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in and out of the site.</li> 
  <li>Campaigning, by coding the following factors as present or absent: negative advertising, credit claiming, downloading of logos, joining online campaign, e-mail <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>subscription.</li>
  </ol>
  
<p>In addition to comparing the various indices across all the parties, the scores from the measures were combined in a number of other ways for further analysis. For example, the mean scores for the combined results for parties in parliament were compared with those of the parties <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parliament to determine whether there were differences in the way these two groups were using their Websites, both in terms of the functions they were performing online, and the delivery of those functions. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>two-tailed student's t-test was used to <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>significance of the difference in the mean scores of the groups on the various measures.&nbsp; Though the two tailed t-test identifies when the differences between the groups can be con0ered to have occurred due to chance (i.e., are not statistically significant), or not due to chance (i.e., are statistically significant), it is necessary to treat 
the data with caution because of the small size of the two <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>(seven parties within Parliament and eight parties <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of Parliament). We should not automatically <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>that, when the t-test did not show statistically 
significant differences, the differences between groups were <span>purely</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>by chance. This is what is known in statistics as a Type II <span>error</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> i.e., when we declare that there is no significant effect when it really is there.&nbsp; We also 
should not <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>that when the t-test did show <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>significance, the differences were not <span>purely</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>by chance (a Type I error). </p>

<p>In addition, the mean score of the two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties (Labour and National) were also compared with the mean score of the five minor parties within Parliament.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, because there were only two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties, it was not possible to employ a <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span><span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to determine if the differences between the means of the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>and minor parties are statistically significant, and therefore, it is not possible to draw conclusions from these comparisons. Nonetheless, interesting observations relating to why the differences exist, both between parties in0e and <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>Parliament, and the two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>and five minor parties in Parliament, shed light on the functions performed online by the political parties. </p>

<p>Qualitative analysis made it possible to determine aspects such as to whom a party's Website was linked and who was linking to a party's site, allowing the research to go beyond simply knowing how many <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>there were to and from a party's Website.</p>

<p>To address the second research question<sup><a href="#Footnote4">4</a></sup>, the data had to be analysed in relation to 'site delivery', that is, how effectively the site delivered the functions identified by the first research 
question. The data were coded into six categories: (1) <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>and appearance; (2) accessibility; (3) navigability; (4) freshness; (5) responsiveness; and (6) visibility.</p>

<p>Most of the criteria used for the second research question were <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>from Gibson and Ward (2000), though the following changes were made. The absence or presence of metadata was analysed to measure navigability. While there has been some debate on this issue, the use of good metadata has been seen as a way of helping <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>engines retrieve relevant information (<a href="#Cullen">Cullen &amp; Houghton, 2000</a>). The level of compliance with the Web accessibility tool, <i>Bobby</i><sup><a href="#Footnote5">5</a></sup>, was <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to assess accessibility. And, criteria relating to privacy and to the suitability of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>for certain groups such as <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>were addressed to examine ethical aspects. The visibility of parties' Websites was <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>by whether there were <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>from the Electoral Commission <span>list</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> the Te Puna Web Directory, and the Yahoo! index of New Zealand political parties because Yahoo! is likely the most common way for people <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of New Zealand to access this 
type of information.</p>

<p>The initial analysis involved comparing the scores for each factor across the parties. Then the mean scores for the parties in0e parliament and those <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parliament were combined to determine whether there is any difference in site delivery between the two groups. The data were also analysed by comparing the mean scores for the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>and the minor parties in parliament, in order to determine the differences between these two groups. Again, t-tests were applied, but the small <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>sizes made it difficult to demonstrate statistically significant differences.</p>

<p>The indices for the analysis relating to both research questions were compiled from the results taken from the last week of the study, the 23rd to the 29th December 2002. This week was chosen as being the most representative and up-to-date at that point in time because the Websites for two parties, the Democrats and the Progressive Coalition, had undergone redevelopment by this stage.</p>

<h2>Overview of the parties' Websites</h2>

<p>This section gives an overview of New Zealand political parties' Websites, providing some basic information and highlighting some of the key <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of those sites. The analysis is presented in three <span>tables</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> Table 1 focuses on the political parties in0e parliament, that is those with electorate and/or <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>members elected during the 2002 election, whereas Table 2 provides the same information for the parties that are <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parliament, that is, without any elected members. The first column provides the name of the party and its founding date. The second column provides some general information about each site, including its size, which was <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>by the number of files on the site.The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>column focuses on downward ICFs, which by far was the greatest use made of the Websites. The fourth column gives <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of the upward and lateral ICFs, while the final column <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>a brief overview of the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>'site delivery' <span>features</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> that is, whether the site was 'glitzy' in terms of use of colour, <span>photographs</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>or multimedia, whether it was navigable or had accessibility or privacy <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>or issues related to currency that were worthy of comment. Table 3 shows how the parties fared in the 2002 general election.</p>

<h2>The functions that New Zealand political parties were performing online</h2>

<h3>Information Provision</h3>

<p>All of the parties were using their Websites to provide information to some <span>degree</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> and the mean score for all parties for providing information was 6.47 out of a maximum possible score of 13. The parliamentary 
parties (mean score 7.71) provided more information than their non-parliamentary counterparts (mean score 5.38), though the difference between the two groups based on the two tailed t-test was p=.08, which is not statistically 
significant. The differences between the two groups were mainly in three areas: newsletters; media releases; and leader profiles. While all of the parliamentary parties had these items present on their Websites, only half of 
the non-parliamentary parties provided any media releases, and less than half of them supplied any newsletters or information about the party leader.</p>

<p>The other <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>difference between the two groups, not <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>by the index, was in the quantity of information that was made available. For example, the parliamentary parties had a mean of 993.71 media 
releases available on their Websites. By <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>the non-parliamentary parties had a mean of only 16.88 media releases. This result is statistically significant (p=.02) suggesting that the difference between the two groups was not due to chance, that is to say, parliamentary parties are far more likely than non parliamentary parties to use their Websites for media releases. Another example of a difference in the quantity of information not <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>by the index was the number of newsletters made available on the Websites of the various parties. The mean number available on the parliamentary party sites was 78.3 newsletters, whereas the mean on the sites of the three parties <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>Parliament was only 3.25. Again, the difference is statistically significant (p=.03), which <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>suggests that the difference between the two groups was not likely to be due to chance.</p>

<p>Going back to information provision as <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in the index, the mean score for the two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties was 9.5, while the mean score for the minor parties in Parliament was 7.0. It is important to bear in mind that the higher mean scores for the two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties was because the index did not measure the <i>amount</i> of information made available on each Website. If the number of media releases and newsletters had been used in the 
index, the two largest Websites would have been those of ACT and the Greens, two of the minor parties. In fact, the mean number of press releases provided by the five minor parties in Parliament (1026.8) was 115.8 more than the mean of the two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties (911.0), thanks mainly to ACT and the Greens, which provided 1,293 and 2,633 media releases as well as 219 and 102 newsletters, <span>respectively</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> on their Websites.</p>

<p>Even more striking was the difference between the two groups in the number of other <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>that were available. National <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>just a single discussion paper on immigration, while Labour had no <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>on its 
site. In <span>comparison</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> the <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>on the Green Party Website included Green Party Bills in Parliament, submissions and reports to Parliament and newspaper articles. ACT had similar material on its Website, and also provided the full text of two books written by ACT MPs.</p>

<p>Overall, it was clear that all the parties saw their Websites as being an important <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>for disseminating large <span>amounts</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of information. Although the non-parliamentary parties provided much less material than their parliamentary counterparts, information provision was still the most important function of their Websites.</p>

<p>When compared to the earlier study in Australia by Gibson and Ward (<a href="#Gibson2002">2002</a>), 
there appears to have been little change in this area. The parliamentary parties in both countries were providing similar levels of information on their Websites, and the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>areas of information provision were policies and media 
releases. However, the non-parliamentary parties in New Zealand were providing con0erably more information than their Australian counterparts.</p>

<h3>Resource Generation</h3>

<p>The scores varied widely in this index, and the mean score for all parties was 2.6 out of a possible maximum score of 9. The parliamentary parties had a mean score of 3.86 and for the non-parliamentary parties the mean 
score was 1.5.; While the t-test results showed that the difference between the means of the two groups is not statistically significant (p=.1), there are several points <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>examining. First, three of the non-parliamentary parties made no attempt to generate resources online, and the only non-parliamentary party using its Website to do more than attract new members was the Christian Heritage Party. On the other hand, all of the parliamentary parties, with the exception of United Future, provided at least an online inquiry form on their Websites.</p>

<p>This index was the only one in which the minor parliamentary parties (mean score 4.2) out-performed the two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties (mean score 3.0), due to ACT and the Greens. The Greens, who scored the maximum of 9, were the 
only party to take full opportunity of the ability to generate resources online, especially with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to selling merchandise. Their Website had pictures of the merchandise available, and also provided downloadable order forms for those not willing to purchase online. ACT was the only other party selling merchandise online, but did not offer an online transaction.</p>

<p>While many of the New Zealand parties made some attempts to attract new members online, only three made any attempts to solicit donations or sell merchandise on their Websites. This closely matched the results of the study by Norris (<a href="#Norris">2001</a>), who found that while more than 50% of parties made some provision for online membership, the two least common functions on party Websites were donation and merchandise (163). It is somewhat surprising that while four of the parties provided online transaction forms for membership, they did not take the next step and provide a similar form for donations.</p>

<h3>Participation</h3>

<p>None of the parties scored very highly on the participation index, with the mean score being only 2.0. One of the reasons for the low score was that none of the Websites had a chat room or provided an opportunity for online debate during the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of the study. Another reason was the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of feedback options on all of the Websites.</p>

<p>While the index might <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>that none of the parties particularly encouraged online participation, it is slightly misleading as the some of the Websites included <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>that did not fit into the coding scheme. The ACT Web 
site in particular provided a number of <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>that facilitated online participation. These <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>included an online form to join various discussion groups, forms for members of the public to <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>a parliamentary question to Members of Parliament (MPs), and forms for making a submission on the National Certificate on Educational Achievement. </p>

<p>The parliamentary parties (mean score 2.43) did provide more opportunities for online participation than the non-parliamentary parties (mean score 1.63), but the difference is not statistically significant (p=.09). However, there was a <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>difference between the two groups in terms of the number of e-mail addresses provided. With the exception of New Zealand First, the parliamentary parties generally provided e-mail addresses for their all their MPs and other party officials. In <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>four of the parties <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>Parliament <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>just a single contact address. The mean number of contact addresses for the parliamentary parties was more than four times as many as the mean number provided by the non-parliamentary parties (88 compared with 21).</p>

<p>The two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties scored slightly higher (mean score 3.0) than the minor parliamentary parties (mean score 2.2) on this index. While the Greens and ACT <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>a similar level of participation as the two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties, the other three minor parties simply provided an e-mail address or addresses. In terms of the number of e-mail addresses provided, the difference was more striking, and the combined total of all the e-mail addresses on the 
minor party Websites, at 252, was less than the number of addresses just on the Labour Website.</p>

<p>The <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>number of e-mail addresses provided by the two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties may be indicative of the fact that they have been in existence longer than the other parties and both have well developed party structures. But there was not always a <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>correlation between the size and longevity of a party and the number of e-mail addresses it <span>offered</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> New Zealand First, which has been in existence for ten years and is the <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>largest party in parliament, only provided one e-mail address for the whole party.</p>

<p>Overall, the Websites of the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties did provide more opportunity for participation, but if the other <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>offered on the ACT and Green Party Web sites are taken into account it shows that there was relatively little difference between the two groups with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to promoting online participation.</p>

<p>The earlier study by Gibson and Ward also found that Australian parties were not encouraging online participation (<a href="#Gibson2002">2002</a>). The <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>lack of interactivity on political party Websites appears to confirm the conclusions of other studies that parties are reluctant to engage in a greater level of interactivity because, as mentioned earlier, it could open them up to negativity and heckling (Roper <a 
href="#Roper">1998</a>; D'Alessio <a href="#DAlessio">2000</a>).</p>

<h3>Networking</h3>

<p>This index <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>the total number of hypertext <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to and from external Websites in order to determine how connected the parties were. AltaVista was chosen to measure the <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>into the Websites because it has the ability to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>for all pages that contain <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to a particular Web space, while excluding the internal <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>within the Web space. The results were compiled excluding <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>from the news agency Scoop, as its archives contain a large number of government press releases and accounted for 45% of the total <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>into the Labour party Website.</p>

<p>Networking <span>consisted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>mainly of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span><i>into</i> the Web sites. In fact three of the parties had no <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>at all <i>from</i> their Web sites, and overall ACT was the only party to provide a well organised, comprehensive <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>on its Website. The parliamentary parties were con0erably more connected than the non-parliamentary parties, with a mean of 734.29 <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in and out for the former group compared to an mean of 214.62 for the latter. The t-test demonstrated that the difference between the means for the two groups was statistically significant (p=.005).</p>

<p>In terms of the <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>out from the parties' Websites, the parliamentary parties, with a mean of 107.57 <span>links</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> were clearly ahead of the non-parliamentary parties, with a mean of 12.5. However, the difference in the means is not statistically significant (p=.25). As an explanation, the higher mean for the parliamentary parties was due in large part to the 607 <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>out from the Act Website (542 more than the nearest party).&nbsp; If ACT was taken out of the <span>equation</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> the parliamentary parties still had a mean of 24.33 <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>from their Websites, almost double that of the non-parliamentary parties, though this <span>differential</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>is still not statistically significant (p=.34). As with the 
participation index, the New Zealand First Website <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to be the exception among the parliamentary parties, being the only one with no external <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>at all, highlighting the fact that the function of its Website was almost 
exclusively information provision.</p>

<p>The two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties were more connected than the other parties in Parliament, with a mean of 824.5 <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in and out compared to 695.8 for the other parties. Interestingly, the two most connected sites were those of 
minor parties. While ACT provided a comprehensive <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>out, the Greens took the <span>opposite</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>approach, focusing on making their site as visible as possible by providing a set of <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>instructions on how to link to the 
party's Website. As a result, their site had largest number of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in at 1,142, which was 295 more than any other party.</p>

<p>In Australia Gibson and Ward (<a href="#Gibson2002">2002</a>) found that nearly all the parties connected to internal organisations, in particular State and branch level parties. While New Zealand does not have State-level parties, there were in fact only three <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to regional or electorate party organisations. Much more common among New Zealand parties were <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to MPs' Websites. Twenty-four MPs had their own Websites, with the two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>
parties dominating. Ten Labour MPs and twelve National MPs had their own Websites while the other two belonged to Jeanette Fitzsimons (Greens) and Matt Robson (Progressive Coalition). Overall the level of internal linking by the New Zealand parties was not high at all, with only eight of the fifteen parties having <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to internal organisations.</p>

<h4>Visibility (links into the Websites)</h4>

<p>There was a marked difference between the parties in0e Parliament and those <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>Parliament with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to the number of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>into their Websites. The mean number of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>into the parliamentary party Websites was 625.0, whereas for the non-parliamentary party Websites it was 202.12. The difference here is statistically significant (p=.006) thus it is not likely that the difference between the means occurred <span>purely</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>by chance. Though the difference between the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>and minor parties was not great, with a mean of 789.5 <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in for the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties and a mean of 559.2 for the minor parties, the latter's <span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>was <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>largely through the Greens which had the highest number among all parties of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>into its Website (1,142).</p>

<h4>Who was linking into the Websites?</h4>

<p>The total number of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>into a Website is a very useful measure of a site's visibility, but it is also very important to identify from where those <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>are coming. For example, both the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party and the Green Party Websites had <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>from like-minded parties around the world. Of the two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties, Labour was the one with more significant <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in. For example, the Labour Party Website was only one of three overseas parties to which there was a link from the Australian Federal Labour Party Website. There were also <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>from Labour parties in the Australian states, and the Socialist International Party. In <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>there was a link to the National Party's Web site only from one counterpart in Australia, the New South Wales Liberal Party, 
and no link from the Australian Federal Liberal Party.</p>

<h3>Campaigning</h3>

<p>This was the index on which the parties scored the lowest, with the mean score for all parties just 1.27, and nearly half of the parties did not undertake any form of online campaigning. The fact that the study was conducted five months after a general election was <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>a key reason for the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of campaigning by the political parties. Another factor related to the low score on this index was the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of specifically negative campaigning. However, 
it may also be a more general characteristic as the Gibson and Ward study (<a href="#Gibson2002">2002</a>) 
also found that Australian parties were undertaking a minimal level of campaigning online.</p>

<p>While the overall level of online campaigning was low, the parliamentary parties (mean score 2.0) outperformed the parties <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>Parliament (mean score 0.63), though according to the two-tailed t-test, the difference was not statistically significant (p=.06). The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>differences between the two groups were in the areas of e-mail lists and credit claiming. The Alliance was the only non-parliamentary party providing the opportunity to subscribe to an e-mail <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>and was also the only one that had pages specifically devoted to credit claiming on its Website.</p>

<p>Overall, the two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties (mean score 3.5), made more of an attempt to campaign online than the minor parliamentary parties (mean score 1.4). National was the one party that <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to be consciously using its Website as a campaign tool. It was the only party to have an online poll, and there were <span>prominent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>links to two other Websites that National had set up to campaign on two significant issues at the time.</p>

<p>However, some of the minor parties did make use of <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>that were not covered by the coding scheme. The Green Party's Website had a number of innovative <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>for online campaigning. This included a form to submit a <span>letter</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to the editor of 39 publications electronically, <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>code for placing Green Party advertisements on Websites, and a downloadable petition.</p>

<h2>Site delivery of the New Zealand political party Websites</h2>

<h3>Images and multimedia</h3>

<p>The <span>visual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>appeal that images and multimedia add are con0ered to make a Web site more effective in delivering its message than plain-text pages (<a href="#Gibson2000">Gibson and Ward, 2000</a>), and the total number of images on each party's Website ranged widely, from 0 to more than 500, and the mean for all the parties was 
79.2.</p>

<p>The parliamentary parties provided a much <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>number of images, with a mean number per Website of 151.43 compared to a mean of 13.75 per site for the non-parliamentary parties. However, once again, the difference 
was not statistically significant (p=.10). The <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>difference between the parliamentary and non-parliamentary parties was the fact that three of the former group had specific 'galleries' of images. The Greens led the way with eighteen different pages of photos, mostly of MPs at different events. The galleries on the other two Websites (those of National and Labour) were more focused on the party leader and on the Labour Website in particular a high proportion of the images were of the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Overall, there were slightly fewer images on the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties' Websites (mean score 105.2) than on the minor parties' Websites (mean score 154.5). The slightly higher mean for the minor parties was mainly because there were more images (553) on the Greens' Website than of all the other parliamentary parties combined (507). It is <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>noting the relatively small number of images on the ACT Website (135), which was a little surprising con0ering the wide <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of other information that was provided.</p>

<h4>Multimedia</h4>

<p>While nearly all the Websites had images on them, less than half had any other multimedia elements. As with the images, there was a significant disparity between the Websites of the parliamentary and non-parliamentary parties. There were video clips on the Greens, Labour and National Websites, and the ACT Web site had audio files. Among the non-parliamentary parties the multimedia was <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>icons on the New Millennium Party and Outdoor Recreation Party home pages, in both cases urging people to vote for the respective parties in the 2002 general election. Because the election had taken place five months earlier, the <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>icons <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>had the effect of drawing <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of currency of the two Websites.</p>

<p>The poor use of multimedia <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>was commented on in earlier studies of political party Websites (e.g., <a 
href="#Auty1998">Auty and Nicholas 1998</a>; <a href="#Roper">Roper 1999</a>; <a href="#Auty2001">Auty 
and Cowen 2001</a>; <a href="#Gibson2002">Gibson and Ward 2002</a>) and the results from this study show that political parties are still not making effective use of this particular <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of the Internet.</p>

<h3>Currency</h3>

<p>The results for the first factor measuring currency, that is, having a date on the home page indicating when the page was last updated, were disappointing. In fact, none of the parties except for Outdoor Recreation explicitly stated on its Website when it had been updated. This was not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>a problem with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to the parliamentary parties, who generally put dated <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to the latest press releases on their home pages, but it was more of a problem on the Websites of some of the smaller parties, which were not updated as regularly.</p>

<h4>Frequency updated</h4>

<p>This area was one in which the difference between parties in0e parliament and those <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parliament was very evident. The parties in parliament regularly updated their Websites over the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of the study. The one 
exception was the Website of the Progressive Coalition, which was only updated in the last week of December. This may, however, be con0ered an aberration as the site was being redeveloped during the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of the study. Of the eight parties <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parliament, only the Alliance, the Christian Heritage Party, the Democrats and One New Zealand updated their Websites over the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of the study.</p>

<p>It was also important to measure the extent to which the sites were updated. So, the amount of new material <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to the updated Web sites was also <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>by comparing the Websites on the first week first week of the study with the last week of the study. By far the most common items <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>were media releases, specifically press releases. It was highly apparent that the parliamentary parties <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>con0erably more material to their Websites 
than did the non-parliamentary parties, with an mean of 52.14 new items <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>for those in0e as compared to a mean of just 3.75 new items for those <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>Parliament. The difference in the mean number of new items <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>was statistically significant (p=.005)</p>

<p>The mean number of new items <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties' Web sites was 76.5, compared to a mean of 42.4 new items <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to the minor parties' Websites. However, this difference was not statistically significant 
(p=.68). National was particularly active in putting its press releases online, and this <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to confirm that one of the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>functions of its Website was a campaigning tool.</p>

<p>The results for the New Zealand parties were similar to the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>for parties in other countries. The study conducted by Auty and Cowen (<a href="#Auty2001">2001</a>, 350) of political parties in the United Kingdom also found that the parliamentary parties updated their Websites more regularly than the non-parliamentary parties, as did the study by Gibson and Ward of Australian political parties (<a href="#Gibson2002">2002</a>).</p>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

<p>None of the Websites scored well on this index, and the mean score was only 1.13. The one common factor among the Websites was that they did not use frames, and only three of the Websites provided any other accessibility <span>features</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> On the Labour Website there was an option to view a text-only version of the site, while on the National and ALCP Websites <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>could be printed as text-only. None of the Websites provided <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>for visually impaired users or <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>a version of the site in another language, although the Greens, Labour and ACT Websites did have small <span>amounts</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of material in other <span>languages</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The parliamentary parties (mean score 1.29) <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to score marginally better than the non-parliamentary parties (mean score 1.0) on this index, though the difference was not statistically significant (p=.3). However, as the Websites of the parliamentary parties were generally <span>larger</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> had more images on them, and provided a con0erably <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>amount of information, their level of accessibility was <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>quite poor. In terms of the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>and minor parties, the only difference between the two groups was the extra <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>on the National and Labour Websites. Con0ering the <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>that ACT and the Green Party were putting into making large <span>amounts</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of information available on their Websites and their use of innovative <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in other areas, it was surprising that they were not <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>advantage of measures to make this information as accessible as possible.</p>

<p>The second measure used to evaluate the accessibility of the parties' Web sites was to check their level of compliance with the Bobby accessibility guidelines, and once again the results were disappointing. Of the fifteen political party Websites, only the One New Zealand site complied with the basic Bobby <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>status<sup><a href="#Footnote6">6</a></sup> because it was the only site with no images on the home page. All the other 
party Websites <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to comply because they did not provide alternative text for the images on their home pages.</p>

<p>The Websites scored better when it came to accessibility in practice, as they were nearly all working <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of the study. The one exception was the Democrats' Website, which was not available during the first 
week of the study. The site was being redeveloped, but was working again for the next three weeks of the study.</p>

<h3>Navigability</h3>

<p>This index <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>the number of navigation aids that were provided on the Websites. The score here was additive in the sense that one point was <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>for each of the following items that were present:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Navigation tips </li>
  <li>Number of <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>engines </li>
  <li>Home page icon on each page </li>
  <li>Menu bar on each page </li>
  <li>Site <span>map</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span></li>
  <li>Presence of metadata </li>
  <li>Metadata compliant with international standards. </li></ul>
  
<p>There was a real mixture of scores for navigability, which can partly be attributed to the vastly different sizes of some of the Websites. It was interesting to note that the two sites that had undergone some redevelopment, 
those of the Progressive Coalition and the Democrats, both scored relatively well on this index.</p>

<p>The mean score for all the parties was 2.73, and the parliamentary parties (mean score 3.43) certainly provided a greater level of navigability on their Websites than the non-parliamentary parties (mean score 2.13). Though the difference in the mean scores between the two groups was not statistically significant (p=.09), this result was to be <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>as some of the non-parliamentary parties had very small Websites that did not <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>sophisticated navigation aids. The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>difference between the two groups was that the Websites of the parliamentary parties, with the exception of United Future's, had a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>engine of some form on them. In <span>comparison</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> among the non-parliamentary parties there were <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>engines only on the Alliance and Christian Heritage Party Websites.</p>

<p>The non-parliamentary parties fared better with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to metadata which was present on five of the Websites compared to four of the parliamentary party Websites. The non-parliamentary parties also generally provided more metadata, and Labour was the only parliamentary party with an <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span><span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of metadata elements on its home page, fifteen in all. However, none of the Websites clearly complied with international metadata standards such as Dublin Core.</p>

<p>A site <span>map</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>was the least common navigation aid and was only present on three of the sites, those of the Green Party, Labour and the Democrats. In their <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of New Zealand government department Website users, Cullen and Houghton (<a href="#Cullen">2000</a>) found that a site <span>map</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>was regarded as an important way of locating information on a Website. Therefore, by not including a site <span>map</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> the majority of parties were reducing the effectiveness of their Websites.</p>

<p>The level of navigability on the Websites of the two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties (mean score 3.0) was slightly less than that on the minor parties' Websites (mean score 3.6). The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>difference between these two groups was the extra navigation aids on the Green Party Website. As well as the basic measures, the Green site also had a site <span>map</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>and was the only Website to offer an <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>search function. The other party that provided a large amount of information on its Website, ACT, also <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>a good <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>engine, which allowed a user to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>a particular area of the Website for a specific subject and for material written by a specific MP. The help page was not as <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>as the one on the Green Party's Website, but it did explain the use of <span>Boolean</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>operators and provided 
some examples of possible queries.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Websites of the two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties did not offer the same level of searchability. The <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>function on the National Website was particularly basic, with just a simple keyword <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>and no help function. 
There were more <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>on the Labour Website, with the ability to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>a particular date <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>and use basic <span>Boolean</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>operators, but once again no help was provided.</p>

<h3>Privacy</h3>

<p>This index was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to compare how all the parties handled privacy online by measuring whether the following <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>were present or not on their Web sites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A privacy statement, indicating how information provided by visitors to the site would be used.</li> 
  <li>A warning about information that might be encountered when following <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>provided on the Website.</li> 
  <li>A double-opt-in system to prevent malicious subscription to newsletters and e-mail lists. </li></ul>
  
<p>The results for the first measure, the privacy statement, were disappointing. Most of the Websites provided some opportunity for users to supply information to the parties, yet there were only five parties with privacy <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>on their Websites. The <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to the privacy <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>were generally located at the bottom of the home pages, and were generally easy to find. However, the link on the Labour Website was labelled &quot;legal info&quot;, which was not quite so clear, and the link on the National Website was labelled &quot;help&quot;, which was even less obvious. The format of the <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>also <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>a standard pattern, outlining what information was collected, how it would be used, information about cookies, and providing a contact e-mail address for <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>about privacy.</p>

<p>The results for the second measure, a warning about information that could be encountered in <span>links</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> were marginally better. Five of the twelve sites that had external <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>provided the appropriate warnings. They were <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>the same sites that had privacy <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>on them, so it was clear these five parties had at least been con0ering the broader implications of online privacy.</p>

<p>The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>measure was the use of a double opt-in system for subscriptions to e-mail lists and newsletters. This was an area of <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in the lead up to the 2002 general election, with one commentator critical of ACT in particular for the subscription system used on its Website, describing it as being open to malicious use (<a 
href="#Brown">Brown, 2002</a>). It appears that the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>had not changed much in the five months 
since the election, as only two of the six sites that provided for online subscriptions used the double opt-in system, those of Labour and the Greens.</p>

<p>The <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>being paid to privacy was highlighted by the complete absence of privacy provisions on the Websites of the non-parliamentary parties. While they were not collecting information to the same extent as the 
parliamentary parties, they all provided some opportunity for feedback and/or <span>links</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> so basic privacy <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>should have been provided.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>This research has <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to determine the functions that New Zealand political parties have been performing online and how effectively they have been performing those functions.</p>

<p>We have found that New Zealand political parties are not using the Internet effectively. Most of the political parties are using their sites extensively for providing information, yet they are not making available the <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>required to make this information as accessible as possible nor are they promoting upward flows of information or the interactive <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>possible on the Internet. It appears that little has changed since the lead-up to the 1996 
general election when Roper (1998) found that New Zealand political parties used their Websites for top-down information provision, <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>few opportunities for interactivity and <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to use the full <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of available technology.</p>

<p>In this study, the political parties were using their Web pages primarily for distributing information widely and rapidly. Of the five functions evaluated, the <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of information was one of only two functions in which all parties were engaging, and it provided the highest mean score on the index. The Websites of the parliamentary parties <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>a much wider <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of information and in much greater depth than those of the parties <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>
parliament, specifically in the areas of media releases, policy <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>and newsletters.</p>

<p>Online participation was the only other function in which all the parties were engaging. Nonetheless, their engagement in this function was at a much lower level than in information provision and it was <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to offering contact e-mail addresses on the Websites. Overall, the parliamentary parties provided more opportunities for participation on their Websites than the non-parliamentary parties.</p>

<p>Very few of the parties were using their Websites for campaigning. This <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>is likely to have occurred because the study was undertaken during a relatively quiet <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in the electoral cycle and the sites that had been set up by parties specifically for campaign <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>(e.g., <a  href="http://www.votegreen.org.nz/">www.votegreen.org.nz</a>) were excluded from the sites selected for analysis.</p>

<p>The study also found that New Zealand political parties were performing online functions very similar to those identified as being performed by Australian parties in the study by Gibson and Ward (<a  href="#Gibson2002">2002</a>) and by British parties in the study by Auty and Cowen (<a 
href="#Auty2001">2001</a>).</p>

<p>The participation index demonstrated that the New Zealand political parties were not <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>advantage of the greater interactivity and two-way communication that is possible on the Internet. While all the Websites had at least one contact e-mail address, there were very few other opportunities for genuine interactivity. None of the Websites had a chat room or provided any opportunities for online debate, and only two sites <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>Members' only areas. The results again are similar to the Australian <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of Gibson and Ward (<a 
href="#Gibson2002">2002</a>) and to Roper's early study (<a href="#Roper">1998</a>) of New Zealand party Websites.</p>

<p>In general, the parliamentary parties were using their Websites for a wider <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of functions and had more connected Websites than the non-parliamentary parties. The differences were not as significant between the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>and the minor parties in parliament, but the two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties did lead the other parliamentary parties in all the indexes, apart from information provision. Again, the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>in New Zealand conforms to the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of Gibson and Ward (<a href="#Gibson2002">2002</a>) in that party competition in cyberspace is relatively 'normal,' with the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties being more visible than their minor and non-parliamentary counterparts.</p>

<p>In terms of site delivery, the parties overall were not very effective. There was little use of multimedia, poor levels of accessibility and inadequate provision of navigation aids. However, some of the most marked differences 
between the parliamentary and the non-parliamentary parties occurred with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>to site delivery. The parliamentary parties updated their Websites more <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>con0erably more material than the non-parliamentary parties, four of whom did not update their Websites at all over the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of the study. Another marked difference was in the area of privacy, as none of the parties <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parliament had any privacy provisions on their Websites.</p>

<p>One of the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>factors hampering effective site delivery was the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of compliance with some basic criteria. This was most obvious in the area of accessibility. All of the sites bar one <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>the basic level of compliance 
with Bobby, and the only provision for accessibility on most of the sites was the non-use of frames. Con0ering that the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>function of the Websites was information provision, it was surprising that none of the parties had really 
con0ered how to make the information on their sites as accessible as possible.</p>

<p>In general, the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>parties were using their Websites more effectively than the other parties, but the Green Party had the most effective online presence. In terms of function, its Website performed well in all of the 
indices, and took the greatest advantage of the opportunities for online resource generation. The Green Party demonstrated an awareness of the possibilities of online politics, particularly in the areas of online participation and campaigning through the inclusion of <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>such as the members' area, the online petition, the provision of code for putting Green Party advertisements on Websites and instructions for linking to the party's Website. In terms of delivery, the Green Party Website also stood out with a large number of images, multimedia, privacy provisions, and very good navigability. The other Website that stood out, especially in terms of function, was that of ACT. It also provided a large variety of information and <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>a good level of participation. However, the site was let down by poor delivery compared to the Green's Website, especially in terms of navigation and privacy.</p>

<p>This study concludes that the use made by New Zealand political parties of their Websites is similar to that of their overseas counterparts, the New Zealanders nonetheless are not making effective use of the Internet. More 
interactivity, two way flows of information, and greater accessibility would all allow a higher level of public involvement in political party activities. For example, by allowing upward flows of information, New Zealand political parties could <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>public input into the development of their policies. And, even if they fear heckling, they could <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>input from party members though a members' only area.</p>

<h3>Recommendations for <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>research</h3>

<p>The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>recommendation is that a similar study should be carried out at a different time within the electoral cycle. This study was undertaken five months after a general election, therefore another study should be undertaken in the lead-up to a general election as there is likely to be higher levels of online campaigning during this <span>period</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>This study only evaluated the official Websites of New Zealand political parties. However, many of the parties have also set up Websites for specific groups within the party, or specifically for campaign <span>purposes</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span> Therefore, a 
more <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>study, which would include these sites, should be undertaken to evaluate whether they are used for different functions or are used more effectively by the parties.</p>

<p>The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>recommendation is that research should be undertaken into the use of the Internet by Green Parties around the world. This study has found that the Green Party is using its Website more effectively than any other New Zealand party, which matches the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:123px 41px 123px 41px;position:relative;">.</span>of Norris (<a href="#Norris2001">2001</a>) and Gibson and Ward (<a href="#Gibson2002">2002</a>). Therefore, it would be informative to determine why Green Parties around the 
world have adapted to the Internet so successfully.</p>

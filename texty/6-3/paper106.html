<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The creation of the Internet has opened new possibilities for publishers of 
electronic journals and distributors of newspapers. Computer network is a 
suitable electronic media, which promises global integration of all publishing 
resources. It allows the storage of databases and delivery of the latest information by 
using search mechanisms.</p>

<p>The first computer network of governmental and educational institutions in 
Lithuania Litnet was established in 1991. By 1994 it had become a 
full member of the Internet. Since then the number of Internet providers has been
constantly growing. At present there are twelve companies working in this commercial 
area. Most of them offer to put a Web-site on their server, others employ 
programmers and designers to provide creation of the Web sites as well <a 
href="#valiulis">(Valiulis, 1998).</a></p>

<p>In 1995 various institutions, organisations and commercial companies started 
spreading information through WWW homepages. In five years the number of 
Lithuanian Internet services have increased 18 times. In 1999 more than 19800 
Web sites were registered. Electronic periodicals make up only 1 percent of them 
<a href="#kuliesas">(Kuliesas, 1999).</a></p>

<p>The article deals with Lithuanian full-text electronic periodicals 
distributed via WWW. An electronic periodical is usually defined as a regular 
publication on some particular topic distributed in digital form, chiefly via 
the WWW but also by electronic mail or digital disk <a 
href="#dictionary">(The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing, 1999).</a></p>

<p>A traditional periodical is defined as 'a regularly appearing publication 
with the same title but new content, of uniform design, numbered or dated, 
having the same format and bulk' <a href="#knygotyra">(Knygotyra, 
1997)</a>. This definition may be adopted for research of electronic 
periodicals, as their structure remains essentially similar. The author's aim 
was modest: to review existing Lithuanian e-periodicals and define the possible 
hypothesis for the future research.</p>

<p>Lithuanian electronic periodicals were retrieved using Lithuanian electronic 
catalogues and information retrieval systems: <a target=window 
href="http://www.on.lt/">Lietuva Internete</a>, <a target=window 
href="http://www.search.lt/">Search.lt</a>, <a target=window 
href="http://www.press.lt/">Press.lt</a>. </p>

<p>The growth of electronic periodicals on the Internet coincides with the rate 
of Internet growth. In 1996 two electronic periodicals have been started in 
Lithuania. In 1997 14 periodicals have been distributed on the Internet, in 1998 
- 43, in 1999 there are 106 full-text electronic periodicals. The starting date 
of any publication is not precise, as it has been established by the date of 
creation of the archive and information announced in press.</p>


<div align="center"><img src="p106fig1.gif" width=529 height=270> </div>

<p>The author has surveyed 106 publications. Thirty-four are distributed only on 
the Web, while 72 have printed versions. Information on printed periodicals was collected 
from national bibliography <a href="#bgzinios">(Bibliografijos 
zinios, 1998)</a>.<br>The number of analysed publications is not very big, 
but four years of electronic publishing and the variety of periodicals allows us to
establish the causes of this phenomenon, the main features of development and some 
perspectives.</p>

<p>Electronic periodicals were analysed according to their type, 
purpose, content, publisher, regularity, language, starting date and place of 
publishing, archive, advertising, design, access to the users, usage of 
counters, etc.</p>

<h2>Publishers of e-periodicals</h2>

<p>Most of the publishers of Lithuanian electronic periodicals (approximately 92%) 
are different organisations: joint enterprises, libraries, seminaries, 
churches, publishing houses, societies, industrial enterprises, local 
municipalities, and others. Many of them are well-known publishers of 
traditional periodicals: Closed Joint Enterprise (CJE) <b><i>Lietuvos rytas</i></b>, CJE 
<b><i>Lietuvos aidas</i></b>, FCJE <b><i>Moteris</i></b>, CJE <b><i>Veidas</i></b>, etc. Their printed production already has a significant share in the market. The electronic 
publications they offer have well-known features.</p>

<p>The publishers distributing electronic periodicals only via WWW mainly belong 
to the group of leading Lithuanian companies in computer technologies: <a 
target=window href="http://www.5ci.lt/"><b><i>Penki kontinentai</i></b></a> (Five 
Continents), <a href="http://www.lithill.lt/"><b><i>Lithill</i></b></a>, and <a 
target=window href="http://www.tdd.lt/"><b><i>Skaitmenines komunikacijos</i></b></a> 
(Digital Communications). Publishing activity is undertaken as one of many 
directions related to the development of Internet technology. Other publishers 
are private persons either starting as professional Internet publishers, or 
wishing to spread information on issues of their concern. Some of them are just 
experimenting and testing various possibilities.</p>

<p>Most publishers are producing only one periodical. Seven publishers 
publish more than one electronic periodical: <a target=window 
href="http://www.5ci.lt/"><i><b>Penki kontinentai</b></i></a>, <a target=window 
href="http://www.lithill.lt/"><b><i>Lithill</i></b></a>, <a target=window 
href="http://www.lrytas.lt/"><i><b>Lietuvos rytas</b></i></a>, Department of International 
Relations of <a target=window href="http://www.ktu.lt/">Kaunas Technological 
University</a>, <a target=window href="http://www.vtu.lt/">Vilnius Technical 
University Press</a>, <a target=window href="http://www.lrs.lt/">Seimas Press 
Service</a>, Joint enterprise <a target=window href="http://www.rtn.lt/"><b><i>News 
of communication and technology</i></b></a>. All of these publishers have strong 
economic foundations.</p>

<p>Two thirds of e-periodicals are published in Vilnius. Other major towns 
publish only a few: Kaunas - 8; Klaipeda - 3, Panevezys - 1. Electronic periodicals were also started in provincial towns, such as Prienai, Druskininkai, Mazeikiai, Telsiai, Vilkaviskis, and Jonava. The main reason for this unequal growth of periodicals is the concentration of traditional publishing and intensive development of Internet technologies in the capital 
city.</p>

<p>The publishers of electronic periodicals have the same characteristics as 
publishers of printed periodicals (as they are identical in most cases). The 
publishers distributing periodicals only on the Web form a small group, but they are 
the main creators of publications in non-traditional format, the promoters of 
modern interactive journalism.</p>

<p>The role of the publisher is mainly to collect information and material and 
publicise it. The goals may be different: getting profit, self-advertising, 
education, dissemination of news, etc. In every case a publisher has to perform 
several functions:</p>

<ul>
<li>to organise the content of a publication;</li>
<li>to organise distribution of a publication;</li>
<li>to organise publishing management <br><a href="#grycz">(Grycz, 1997).</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Publishers perform these functions for centuries. The internal framework of 
traditional publishing of periodicals includes editing, production, 
distribution, and management. These functions have not changed in electronic 
publishing. But they are performed using different methods and have an added 
value <a href="#neuberger">(Neuberger, <i>et al.</i>, 1998)</a>.</p>

<p><i>The organisation of contents</i> in electronic publications is the main 
challenge, as its quality determines the accessibility of information. In 
Lithuanian electronic publications the contents is presented according to the 
issues and topics of the articles or time of appearance (dates). This creates 
possibilities for the users to find relevant information quickly. The access to 
information is easy and the realisation of the function increases information 
usage and its value for the user.</p>

<p>The function is realised more successfully when the archives of the 
publication and retrieval possibilities in these archival databases are created. 
80 publications have archives, 26 publications allow to use only current 
information. The archives of the publications with the printed analogues are 
created according to the issues. The archives of other publications are 
organised according to the topics and the time of publishing of the 
articles.</p>

<p>Another important function of the publisher is <i>the organisation of 
dissemination</i>. The publishers presenting the electronic periodicals on the 
net have to invest into this activity. Only some publishers have decided to 
disseminate the publications themselves. In most cases the mediators between 
publishers and users disseminate the e-periodicals, usually the professionals of 
Internet technologies. Some electronic publications are presented not only on 
the Internet but distributed via e-mail as well. E-mail is an important link in 
dissemination of the news to the permanent readers.</p>

<p>Access to information is related to the economic model of publishing, which 
is in the stage of development. The publishers create the economic model by 
experimenting with subscription, advertising, registration fees, etc. The 
experts of the industry have found out that only a small number of Internet 
sites require payment for service <a href="#grycz">(Grycz, 1997)</a>.</p>

<p>In Lithuania,  access to e-periodicals is also free of charge. To secure 
the controlled access publishers have to spend additional funds. Besides, the 
negative side of any prevention is the inconvenience to users and, as a 
consequence, a diminishing number of potential users. Only some publishers use 
control devices: some of the articles in <a target=window 
href="http://www.kurjier.lt/"><b><i>Litovskij kurjer</i></b></a> and <a target=window 
href="http://www.kurjier.lt/"><b><i>Vilniusskij vestnik</i></b></a> are accessible only to 
 registered readers; the site of <a target=window 
href="http://www.infotec.lt/monitorius"><b><i>Monitorius</i></b></a> magazine does not allow 
 access to the current issue; and the archive of only the last seven days of the 
daily <a target=window href="http://www.lrytas.lt/"><b><i>Lietuvos rytas</i></b></a> is 
accessible without restrictions.</p>

<p>The system of fees is not popular and another source of the income may be 
advertising. At present only a quarter of the sites of Lithuanian e-periodicals give 
advertisement headings. A part of these sites take part in the system of ad 
heading exchange and the profit from advertising is indirect. Only <a 
target=window href="http://www.lrytas.lt/"><b><i>Lietuvos rytas</i></b></a> has a system of 
commercial advertising of the company.</p>

<p>The great advantage of printed periodicals is to present a product which is 
already well known in the market. The electronic version of the known 
publication acquires new positive features: free access, interactive search 
possibilities, attractive design, feedback to the site, retrieval in archival 
databases, support of discussion groups. These advantages of e-periodicals may 
affect the subscription to the paper version. 11000 readers visit the site of <a 
target=window href="http://www.lrytas.lt/"><b><i>Lietuvos rytas</i></b></a> every day. The 
publishers understand the risk and the electronic version do not publish 
advertising and announcements of the analogue printed versions. However, it 
would not be a strategic decision for problem solving. It is possible to foresee 
some potential sources of income: ads in WWW homepages or splitting the profit 
with the Internet service providers <a href="#kirvaitis">(Kirvaitis, 1999)</a>.</p>

<p>At present most of the publishers disseminate the publications on the 
Internet without expectation of economic benefit. The spread of all spheres of activity on 
the computer networks serves the needs of the modern society and creates new 
markets. The publishers who stimulate the loyalty of the audience to the 
Internet may derive economic benefit from it later.</p>

<p>The aim of <i>the management of publishing </i> is to ensure successful access to 
the publications, effective use of the presented information, and stimulation of the frequency of  visiting the attractive site. The publishers have to create and support a 
functional system of the site links, the quality of design, and feedback from 
users. Many e-periodicals have functional but dull sites. Only some 
non-traditional periodicals of the vanguard style attract one's attention:</p> 

<ul><li><a target=window href="http://www.coolzone.lt/"><b><i>Coolzone</i></b></a>,</li> 
<li><a target=window href="http://www.pentagonas.com/visom4"><i><b>Visom 4</b></i></a>,</li> 
<li><a target=window href="http://www.spauda.lt/"><b><i>Vartiklis</i></b></a>,</li> 
<li><a target=window href="http://www.kiberzona.lt/"><b><i>Kiberzona</i></b></a>.</li> </ul>

<p>The sites of seven periodicals are the winners of the Fourth WWW Media Championship:</p>

<p>The competition is organised and supported by the Open Lithuania Fund,Infobalt (an association of computer companies), Lithuanian TV broadcasting '@', the magazine <b><i>Naujoji 
komunikacija</i></b> (New Communication), providers of Internet services: 'Taide' and 
'Omnitel', and design studios 'Lietaus dizainas' (Rain design), 'Linkarta', 
'Informacijos tiltas' (Information Bridge) <a href="#cempionatas">(4-asis 
WWW puslapiu cempionatas, 1999)</a>. There are some distinguished specialists of 
design creating attractive Internet sites: 'Penki kontinentai' (Five 
continents), 'Kryptis' (Direction), 'Lietaus dizainas', 'PenTagOn'. However, 
some publishers do not pay attention to the solution of this management task. 
More than ten sites of e-periodicals look commonplace and ugly. As a rule these sites 
also have a small number of visitors.</p>

<p>The Internet publishers may collect management information about users 
directly and without additional costs. Fifty-two sites have visiting meters, some 
publishers present interactive questionnaires on their sites. Each site has an 
 e-mail link for feedback from the users.</p>

<p>The advantages of electronic publishing influence positively the realisation 
of publishers' functions. Easy and quick communication possibilities, and full, 
new information stimulate higher use of information and the development of 
publishing into organising the content of a publication.</p>

<h2>The characteristics of electronic periodicals</h2>

<h3>Types of electronic periodicals</h3>

<p>There are two main types of e-periodicals with regard to their 
structure:<br><br>1) publications with a traditional structure;<br>2) publications 
with a distinctive separation of the form and contents.</p>

<p>Three-quarters of the e-periodicals have what might be called a 'traditional' structure. 
That is, they are grouped into: newspapers, magazines and journals, and newsletters <a href="#knygotyra">(Knygotyra, 1997)</a>. Journals are mainly of scholarly and professional orientation, magazines belong to the sector of mass production and usage. Newsletters usually present official or statistical and other information about the 
organisation that publishes it <a href="#knygotyra">(Knygotyra, 1997)</a>.</p>

<p>In Lithuania the publishers distribute over WWW 25 newspapers, 25 magazines, 7 scholarly journals, and 11 newsletters. They are easily recognised by a characteristic design, traditional structure of an article or item, and regularity of issues.</p>

<p>In 1996, new types of magazines were started. In these periodicals, information 
is presented in certain chapters and sub-chapters. Search is organised according 
to the topics, key words, dates, etc. The notions of a page and an article have 
changed. Interactivity allows the insertion of multimedia objects in an article , the 
elements of animation, databases, three-dimensional stereo-graphics, and other 
material which is impossible to use on paper. Magazines of this type present news as it arrives, rather than being limited by the periodicity of traditional print magazines.</p>

<p>The first periodical of a non-traditional structure in Lithuania is <a 
target=window href="http://www.spauda.lt/">'Vartiklis'</a> (Modem). Several new 
periodicals of this type appear every year. Most of them are created for leisure 
reading (usage). Special ways of organising information are used, however, the 
material is usually limited to texts, photos, and drawings. Lithuanian 
e-periodicals practically do not use the possibilities of the virtual space.</p>

<h3>The language of periodicals</h3>

<p>In Lithuania,naturally, most e-periodicals are published in Lithuanian. But 
e-periodicals may be distributed in several languages as in the case of other WWW sites. At 
present only a few periodicals take the advantage of this possibility (see Table 
2). The data on the languages used in e-periodicals in Lithuania show that 
they are targeted at the Lithuanian audiences or Lithuanian emigrants. Only a few may be of interest to a multilingual global audience.</p>

<h3>Contents and purpose of e-periodicals</h3>

<p>The contents of the periodicals reveal the needs of the users and the requirements for the publishers to disseminate certain information. Seventeen e-newspapers and 13 e-magazines are of a general type. Four advertising publications and 12 information newsletters are distributed through the Web. Seven e-magazines are targeted at the women's audience, 7 are intended for leisure usage. Forty-six electronic periodicals are catering for some special area (see Table 
3).</p>

<p>The number of Lithuanian scholarly journals on the Web is very limited. Only 
seven full-text journals were registered in 1999:</p>

<ul><li><a target=window href="http://www.leidykla.vu.lt/">'Informacijos mokslai'</a> 
(Information science, Faculty of Communication, Vilnius University),</li>
<li><a target=window href="http://lms.pfi.lt/lmsle/revuebaltique_l.html">'Revue

<p>Approximately another sixty publish only summaries or content pages. Specific 
conditions of scholarly publishing that are very different from those in Western 
Europe and other countries restrict the growth of scholarly periodicals on the 
Internet. A different investigation of these conditions should be undertaken. 
However, there is a trend of irregular presentation of full-texts and short life-span of scholarly full-text journals on the Lithuanian net. At present, in 
Lithuania, electronic periodicals are targeted at the mass audience of the Internet. 
When this audience grows and develops its interests and tastes, the contents and 
form of e-periodicals will change and become more diverse.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Electronic publishing in Lithuania is a permanent activity corresponding to 
the needs of the publishers and information users. The publishers develop it 
with experience in printed periodicals and with the creators of WWW sites. The 
results depend on their point of view on the implementation of publishers' 
functions. Most of the full-text e-periodicals are functional, well-designed, 
and present quality information. However, the usage of the possibilities of the 
virtual space such as graphics, animation, and other elements is limited.</p>

<p>Lithuanian e-publishers work for the Lithuanian users of the Internet. The 
present choice of the e-periodicals would not interest global users. The 
scholarly e-journals that are practically non-existent at the moment would be of 
the greater interest for a world-wide audience.</p>

<p>Publishing of e-periodicals is developing in all respects: economic, 
contents, and form. The growing number of users should enhance financial 
possibilities for the publishers and speed up the creation of e-periodicals with 
different structures, on various subjects, and for numerous audiences.</p>

<p>Publishing of e-periodicals has changed the relations of publishers, authors, 
and librarians. New possibilities and problems have appeared. E-periodicals 
belong to a publishing type, which transfers information quickly and reliably, 
and supports attempts to implement the idea of information society.</p>

<p><i>Hypotheses for the research.</i> The first glance overview of Lithuanian 
e-periodicals allows us to formulate research questions and statements that should 
be checked by further investigation:</p>

<ol start="1"><li>The main type of e-periodical corresponding to the requirements of the 
publishers in Lithuania is electronic magazine.</li>

<li>The emerging economic model of publishing is based on free access and the 
prospect of making profit from advertising.</li>

<li>At present Lithuanian e-magazine publishers most satisfactorily perform 
the function of organisation of contents.</li>

<li>The main needs of a user that e-periodicals in Lithuania target are leisure 
and entertainment. These needs are assumed by publishers but not explicitly 
confirmed by users' reaction.</li>

<li>The feedback from the audience is weak.</li>

<li>The specific economic and organisational features of scholarly publishing 
inhibit the appearance of this type of periodicals in electronic format.</li></ol>

<p><i>Note:</i> Lithuanian e-periodicals are selectively registered on the sites 
of Lithuanian libraries and universities. For example, at:</p> 

<ul><li><a 
href="http://www.mb.vu.lt/www/index.htm#on;">http://www.mb.vu.lt/www/index.htm#on;</a> and</li>  
<li><a 
href="http://ic.lms.lt/library/links/period_lith.html;">http://ic.lms.lt/library/links/period_lith.html;</a></li></ul>

<p>To find the mentioned e-periodicals as well as the others used for this 
survey see the Web page of Lithuanian e-periodicals at the site of the Faculty 
of Communication (Vilnius University) maintained by the author of the article:<a

<h1>Editorial</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This issue of <i>Information Research</i> contains papers which describe elements of 
the current and recent work of the <a href="http://www.cerlim.ac.uk/">Centre for Research in 
Library and Information Management (CERLIM)</a> which is based in the Department 
of Information &amp; Communications at Manchester Metropolitan University in the 
U.K. CERLIM has an unusual history. It was founded within the university library 
at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, UK, as a focus for research and 
development activities which, for a number of reasons, had started to increase 
in number and significance. As University Librarian I was at that time primarily 
interested in exploring issues which were closely related to practice. Thus the very first project, 
a study funded by the then British Library Research &amp; Development Department, 
investigated the information-seeking and information-using practices of students 
following a specific mode of distance learning known in the UK as 'franchising'. 
Our interest stemmed from the observation that such students appeared to be 
struggling to access adequate resources to underpin their undergraduate studies. 
The project produced results which were both interesting and useful, leading to 
a new service called <a href="http://www.uclan.ac.uk/library/valnow/">VALNOW 
(the Virtual Academic Library of the North-West)</a> being designed and 
deployed, and also leading 
indirectly to CERLIM's first major research grant from the European Commission. Little 
did we realise at that time that the various EC Framework Programmes would form 
the largest source of research funding for CERLIM for the next ten years.</p>

<p>CERLIM was also an active player in the UK's 
<a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/services/elib/">Electronic Libraries Programme</a>, 
funded by the <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/">Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC)</a>, and it was during this time 
that that opportunity arose to relocate from a University Library to an academic 
department. Although Preston and Manchester are no more than 40 miles apart, 
this was a very considerable culture change for us all and has certainly led to 
the research element of our R&amp;D gaining heightened prominence. Naturally, the 
focus of this research has changed over the years, but it has remained embedded 
in the exploration of real-world issues associated with the organisation, 
delivery and use of information in organisational and personal contexts. Thus 
CERLIM is active in research which explores, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>organisational, social, cultural and technical issues in the development 
  of library and information systems in networked, distributed spaces. There has 
  been an increasing emphasis on strategic evaluation of national-level services 
  and on the question of their impact.</li>
  <li>the user perspective on library and information services, an area which 
  includes information literacy, user satisfaction and quality management 
  (bearing in mind that quality is 'fitness for the purpose of the user') and 
  which includes a specific interest in accessibility and visual impairment.</li>
  <li>information retrieval, again from a user rather than a systems perspective</li>
  <li>cultural heritage in networked environments, including an emphasis on the 
  ability of ordinary citizens to become active contributors to cultural 
  heritage creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>CERLIM has always worked in partnership with other organisations and of 
course European Commission work has often required these partnerships to be 
multinational. Our first non-UK partners were in Ireland and Greece, the latter 
providing us with a longstanding relationship with the University of the Aegean 
in Lesvos, where our biennial
<a href="http://www.cerlim.ac.uk/conf/lww5/welcome.html"> <i>Libraries without Walls</i> conference</a> is held.</p>
<p>In addition to national and international collaborations, there is a very 
close working relationship between CERLIM staff and other staff of the 
Department of Information &amp; Communications. The Department's wide range of 
interests means that there are frequent opportunities to work together. This 
extends to research students who may find synergies with the work of CERLIM and 
are able to draw on a wide range of expertise. The papers in this issue cover 
all of these kinds of collaboration. </p>
<h2>This Issue</h2>
<p>The first paper, which I have written as Director of CERLIM, illustrates the 
way in which research questions arise and start to be addressed: it describes a 
possible new sub-field of enquiry into the retrieval of multimedia objects. The 
origins of this interest actually came out of work on accessibility. We were 
exploring the different ways in which electronic information can be made 
accessible to people with visual impairments. One possibility was to use complex 
tagging of the elements of an object, including end-user defined fields, so that 
navigation did not have to be linear - the analogy with an audio tape which if 
untagged has to be listened to from start to finish is appropriate. If every 
sentence or even every spoken word could be tagged meaningfully, a blind person 
could immediately select the parts of interest. Technically. a number of groups 
were examining the use of multimedia synchronisation protocols for this purpose, 
most notably the <a href="http://www.daisy.org/">DAISY consortium</a>. The 
approach has indeed proved valuable and DAISY devices are now in widespread use. 
However, our thinking led us to wonder whether the underlying protocols and 
standards might not be exploited as a way to enhance the retrieval of objects 
embedded within multimedia presentations. Since the relevant standard defines 
where two objects are to be displayed simultaneously - say an image and an audio 
track - it might be possible to infer retrieval relevance of the second object 
from that of the first, and<i> vice versa</i>. The paper published here,&nbsp;
<i>Synchronised Object Retrieval: the enhancement of  information retrieval performance in multimedia environments using synchronisation protocols</i>, 
reports on initial exploration of the potential of this approach - and suggests 
that this could indeed be a fruitful line of enquiry.</p>
<p>In <i>Task dimensions of user evaluations of information retrieval systems</i> 
Frances Johnson, Jill Griffiths and Dick Hartley report on a project designed to 
explore the development of a framework for the evaluation of IR systems from a 
user perspective. The focus of the study was Internet search engines, but the 
authors postulated that users' evaluations will vary depending on both the user 
and the system features and that a multidimensional approach is therefore 
needed. Their preliminary findings support their hypothesis and they point to 
the need for larger-scale studies to explore this approach further.</p>
<p>Jill Griffiths then contributes a paper derived from one of the constituent 
studies of CERLIM's 3-year <a href="http://www.cerlim.ac.uk/edner/welcome.html">
Evaluation of the Distributed National Electronic Resource (EDNER)</a> project, 
funded by the UK's Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) and designed to 
provide formative evaluation of the development of the DNER, which has now 
become known as the
<a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/index.cfm?name=about_info_env">JISC Information 
Environment (IE)</a>. In this particular study students were given a variety of 
tasks which required the use of electronic services, including those provided by 
the JISC, and they rated these in accordance with 'quality attributes'. The 
results of the study shed light not just on JISC services but also on the ways 
in which this methodology might be modified for future use. A particularly 
interesting finding was the identification of much confusion in students' 
thinking about the concept of 'quality' in networked information environments.</p>
<p>A second study from within the EDNER project is reported by Margaret 
Markland, who explored the ways in which university staff are using information 
resources within virtual learning environments (VLEs). This showed that staff 
are keen to embed resources in their online courses but are encountering many of 
the problems, such as persistent addressing and consistent resource description, 
that have become familiar to librarians and other information professionals. As 
yet there is little evidence of effective cooperation between the two groups.</p>
<p>CERLIM's long-term interest in how users with visual impairments can operate 
effectively in electronic environments is represented by Jenny Craven's report 
on the <i>Non-visual access to the digital library </i>project. This work has 
provided evidence to support what was previously an hypothesis that such users 
are forced to interact with services for far longer than sighted users in order 
to generate useful results. It also revealed that the application of some fairly 
simple design principles - currently largely ignored - could make web sites far 
easier for visually-impaired people to access.</p>
<p>The final paper in this issue is by one of our research students, Sirje 
Virkus, who is undertaking research into information literacy. In this paper she 
surveys the field within a European context and demonstrates that while the 
concept appears to be&nbsp; widely recognised there is no agreement on what it 
encompasses. In many countries information technology and 
basic IT skills are emphasised with little attention paid to an individual's 
ability to access and use information content. Sirje will 
be developing a model for the effective 
delivery of information literacy in open and distance learning during the next 
stage of her research.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Taken together these papers provide a sense 
of the kinds of research which CERLIM undertakes. They are not, and could not 
have been, a comprehensive overview of the whole of our current work, let alone 
the history of our involvement in the field of library and information research. 
As CERLIM celebrates it's tenth anniversary we look forward to the next decade 
of challenging yet fascinating research. When we began in 1993 the World Wide 
Web was just starting to emerge into general use - who knows what innovation 
will be surfacing in 2013?</p>

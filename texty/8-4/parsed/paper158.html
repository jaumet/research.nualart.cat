<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This article reports on a pilot study undertaken as part of a single work package 
  within a large project funded by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC). 
  The EDNER project is the formative evaluation of the JISC Information Environment, 
  and the workpackage of which this study forms part <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to examine the local 
  implementation of JISC-funded and other online information resources. That is,  
  to explore what <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of resources lecturers were <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>selecting for use 
  in their online <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>modules, how they themselves discovered such resources 
  with particular <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>upon whether university librarians had a role to play 
  in the discovery process, and how they were presenting them to their <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> 
  The lecturers in question had all recently expressed an interest in using a 
  Virtual Learning Environment (VLE), WebCT, as a <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>tool. All had 
  had some <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of training in how to use the various facilities <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>by 
  the VLE. The training had not included in any great depth the embedding of online 
  information resources, beyond indicating that this was a <span>possibility</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> The study, 
  therefore, focused on lecturer behaviour. </p>
  
<p>Because the study was also interested in the role played by librarians in this 
  behaviour, it was decided to ask them too for their <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of what lecturers 
  were doing and of the state of the relationship between these two groups. </p>
  
<h2>Background</h2>

<p>As shown below, many writers in the library and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>press have addressed the human aspects of the changes which have been set in motion by the <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>towards <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning in an online <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> The library literature tells of the impact upon the role of library staff and their jobs, while the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>literature describes how a changing awareness of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and their different learning styles can be accommodated in the new technology-enabled VLEs. </p>
  
<p>There are calls, often in the library press, for new alliances to be forged between <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and library staff. McColl (<a href="#mcc01">2001: 238</a>) for example, clarifies the nature of these new relationships in <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>detail. He says, <em>'Librarians should seek to ensure that they remain part of the process as virtual learning takes <span>hold</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> They must explain their role in the information management <span>chain</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>clearly to their academic colleagues...'</em>,  and he neatly draws a <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>between the function of 'middleware', the <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that enables the 'digital information order', and the traditional function of the library in the 'print information order'. He makes the point that the 'middleware' function of librarians may be changing, but is no less relevant in the digital age. McColl's view is augmented by the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of research projects such as Hylife, where Wynne (<a href="#wyn01">2001: 26</a>) remarks, <em>'Collaboration between groups such as teachers, learners, information specialists, Web designers, technical and educational development staff will be a key to Higher Education in the <span>future</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>'</em> and, later, the Inspiral project, where Currier (<a href="#cur01">2001</a>) says, <em>'...these e-learning developments are demanding the collaboration of disparate groups, with different priorities, viewpoints, and even different e-learning "<span>languages</span>" <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>'.</em> and sees the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of such alliances as a barrier to progress. The library press also acknowledges the impact that using a VLE will have on the lecturer. As Harris (<a href="#har01">2001</a>) notes, there are implications for the individual lecturer and the institution: <em>'Gaining the ability to utilise VLEs effectively <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>training programmes and continual support, the cost and logistic of which are often ignored in implementation plans.'</em> while Quinsee (<a href="#qui01">2001</a>) claims that the VLE brings with it <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>additional work for lecturers and new time-consuming activities. </p>

<p>The <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>community is also exploring the challenges and changes facing lecturers who chose to deliver learning modules through a digital <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> Some are <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that they need to rethink their long-held and profound principles about <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> motivation to learn. Jones (<a href="#jon00">2000</a>) speaks of the disappointment of some lecturers whose experience of <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in a networked <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>had not lived up to their expectations. He reports one lecturer using a VLE for the first time as saying:</p>
  
<blockquote>I certainly think I've had to re-think things that I <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in. From a liberal <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>point of view that people were here because they wanted to learn and now I don't know, I'm not sure that they will do this module because they want to learn about it. They'll do this module because they want a specific grade to get the specific final <span>degree</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span></blockquote>
  
<p>A new <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of the nature and process of learning itself is needed, what 
  Laurillard (<a href="#lau01">2001</a>) calls, <em>'...the difference between a curriculum that teaches what is known, and one that teaches how to come to know.'</em></p> 

<p>So it is not just those who teach who must change their standpoint, but those who learn must also reshape their traditional expectations of their learning experience. As Britain and Liber (<a href="#bri99">1999</a>) say: </p>
  
<blockquote>Use of an integrated VLE implies that both staff and <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>are 
  prepared to adopt an educational approach that is inherently more pro-active

  responsive to <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>requirements from the teachers <span>perspective</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span></blockquote>
  
<p>Practical issues such as the re-skilling required by both teachers and learners, described by Jones (<a href="#jon00">2000</a>) as more than simple training in the technology plus the <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of what Thune (<a href="#thu01">2001: 148</a>) describes as resources to ensure that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>are 'fit' to learn <span>independently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and the time commitment needed to learn to use and manipulate this new delivery method are also <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>raised.</p>
  
<p>One opportunity <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>by the VLE to the lecturer is that it enables him or her to link <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to online resources in a way not easy in more traditional <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>environments. Research previously carried out by CERLIM, reviewing how <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>were made to online resources in the wider context of UK HE Websites had suggested great keenness on the part of lecturers to promote online resources to the learner. However when such <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>were set up in non-library environments by <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>staff, certain misrepresentations were not uncommon (<a href="#cer02">CERLIM 2002</a>).</p>
  
<p>It was known too, that when <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>were seeking out online resources to use in their coursework, they tended to be poor evaluators of the academic <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of such resources. McDowell, (<a href="#mcd02">2002: 261</a>) for example, speaks of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>information which 'even if <span>accurate</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> would almost certainly not have the academic seal of approval' and all of these could have implications for the use of online resources in VLEs, and the <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning in the online <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>Many UK Higher Education libraries, including that of the researcher's institution, now have Web pages offering <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to a huge array of well managed, high <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>information resources for <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> lecturers and researchers in all subject areas. These provide evidence of the skills and knowledge of the library and information staff who put together and <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the library's online resource. This <span>raises</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the question of whether lecturers <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>into the online <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>for their <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>already have similar skills, or are calling upon the expertise available in the institution (and particularly the information resource management skills of library and information staff) or whether what Fowell <a href="#fow01">(2001</a>) calls a process of information disintermediation, is more commonly <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>place. This is the removal of the traditional intermediary and the <em>'bringing users or customers into <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>contact with the supplier or service provider.'</em></p>
  
<h3>The study</h3>

<p>To begin to find answers to these questions it was decided to carry out semi-structured interviews at the researcher's University with these two key stakeholder groups, lecturers developing VLEs for the first time as a <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>tool, and librarians. Although only a pilot study has been possible to date, some interesting <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>have already emerged about the opinions and <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of these two key groups, and about some of the <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>which lecturers are faced with as they incorporate the online information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>into their VLEs. These lecturers, although not yet a large percentage of the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>population, are spread across many subject areas and several University sites, so although the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>is small it represents a good cross-section of <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Departments. </p>
  
<h2>Method</h2>

<p>The Learning and Teaching Unit, which provides training for lecturers, was asked for a <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of staff across the university who were delivering their <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in part or entirely through a VLE. The <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>was surprisingly small, with only 39 <span>names</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> An introductory e-mail was sent to all staff on the <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>explaining the purpose of the interviews, and requesting assistance. Face-to-face interview was the preferred method of <span>investigation</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> but as the study took place over the busy examination <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the alternative of an e-mail questionnaire was <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to those who expressed willingness to help, but were concerned about the time commitment involved. This dual approach led to a <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>rate of over 60%, but it quickly became clear that several lecturers had 'dipped their toe into the <span>water</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> and then decided not to deliver their <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in this way. Five said they had done the training but were not currently using a VLE to deliver <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> three were using the discussion group facility only, one was using the VLE as an online <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>but with no <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>content, and one was using the VLE to publicise netball scores and nothing else. </p>
  
<p>Fifteen positive responses were received, covering the Business, Science and Engineering, Education, <span>Law</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> Food Clothing and Hospitality Management, Humanities and <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Sciences communities. Seven <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>hour-long face-to-face interviews and the <span>rest</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>preferred to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>by e-mail questionnaire. The e-mail responses were received very quickly, and helped steer the more in-depth interview <span>discussions</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>Having gained some insight into the views and <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of this group of lecturers, the opinions of library staff on these views were needed. Presenting such a mass of data to individual librarians and requesting follow-up interviews would have <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>unwieldy, so it was decided to <span>hold</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>a 'workshop' session for 15 subject librarians and library managers. At the workshop the research <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>were summarized and presented to the group, and a structured group discussion <span>followed</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> The outcome of these two activities threw some interesting light on issues raised in the literature.</p>
  
<h2>Results</h2>

<h3>Phase 1 - Lecturer consultation</h3>

<h4>Question 1 - Do you link your <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to online resources? </h4>

<p>Lecturers were asked first if they linked their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to online resources from their VLE or elsewhere, and if so to give a few examples of the <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of online materials chosen. All stated that they included such <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and that these ranged widely across commercial sites such as ApparelNet or FoodlineWeb, government sites such as the Information Commissioner for Data Protection or the Office of National Statistics, <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>sites such as HEFCE, <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and commercial gateways to information resources and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>materials such as BoxMind, Merlot or Copernicus, <span>maps</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>both current and historical, images, policy <span>documents</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> original texts of speeches and poetry - with some 'light relief' in the form of joke sites.</p>
  
<p>Lecturers were keen to provide <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to online resources for their <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> seeing them as opening up a route to a wealth of <span>newly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>available and useful material. Particular advantages were the immediate access to very current and dynamic online data, and to <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>data sources. Both of these had been more difficult to access when relying upon <span>purely</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>text-based materials. Most lecturers claimed to be <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>with JISC resources, and found much to praise especially the Resource <span>Discovery</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Network (RDN) <a href="http://www.rdn.ac.uk/">http://www.rdn.ac.uk/</a>. Several further singled out the Virtual Training Suite (VTS) <a href="http://www.vts.rdn.ac.uk/">http://www.vts.rdn.ac.uk/</a> as a useful resource which was valued even when no subject specific tutorial was available. Only one lecturer, however, articulated a key advantage of such gateway resources, saying, <em>'The advantage of JISC stuff is that it is managed. It's unlikely to disappear 
without notice.'</em></p>
  
<h4>Question 2 - How do you find out about <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>online resources? </h4>

<p>When lecturers were asked how they found out about <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>online resources, the most frequent responses were through <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>colleagues and from conducting Web searches. Web searching was particularly popular <em>'I simply put key words into <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>engines and then check out the sites myself'</em> being a <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>
comment. For some, Web searching was also a pleasurable activity. <em>'It's such fun <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>things yourself'</em> said one lecturer. Other <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>included looking in academic or professional journals; attendance at conferences and meetings <em>'both the handouts that you get, plus conversations with other 
delegates'</em> or<em> 'a colleague passed me a <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of useful law URLs she had been given at a conference'</em>; from newspaper articles 'things flagged in the Guardian online pages', or from prior knowledge. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>few had had resources suggested to them by <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> especially part-time <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>who were out in the workplace: '...one used to e-mail me regularly and say "have you seen this Website"', but this was unusual. One lecturer was sent <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>URLs by her mother. No-one spontaneously mentioned seeking help from Library staff in their <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>online material, though almost all claimed to link <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>from their VLE to the Library homepage or to the subject databases or other Library resources. One lecturer who did not do this made the point that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>learned about library resources at induction, and therefore she felt confident that her <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>were already <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>with what was on offer there. </p>
  
<h4>Question 3 - Do you liaise with library staff?</h4>

<p>When asked specifically whether they liaised with library staff it emerged that in fact many did so, and con0ered that they had a good relationship with their library colleagues. However, it was less usual for lecturers to <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and management of online resources with librarians. </p>
  
<p><em>'I mostly go to them for training for myself and my <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> and also their services such as getting new passwords and so on.' or 'I <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>looking for resources as part of my job, and wouldn't think of <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>a librarian.' </em>being <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>responses. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>particularly close working relationship between lecturers and library staff 
was found on the smallest campus with its own library, where lecturers in two Departments praised library staff very highly as being <em>'always supportive and helpful'</em>, a good way to <em>'learn something new'</em> and Do you liaise with library staff. It was not possible to determine whether physical proximity was a significant factor in such a good relationship. </p>
  
<h4>Question 4 - Have you encountered any <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>with the <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and use of online resources?</h4>
  
<p>Several <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>were mentioned, both for the lecturers themselves, and for their <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>
  
<ul><li><strong>Lack of <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>online material.</strong></li></ul>
  
    <p>For themselves, lecturers first pinpointed the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of online material for very specialised courses. An Organic Chemistry lecturer <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>such a course, who relied heavily upon Web searches for resource discovery described herself as ,<em>'pretty isolated with respect to putting stuff like this together'</em>. This echoes a <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>raised in the literature about the <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>relevant material on the Internet.  Burnett and Seuring (<a href="#bur01">2001: 16</a>), for example, <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>shortcomings of the Internet as 
being <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>relevant resources because of a reliance on <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>engines which are,  <em>'perceived as inadequate as they are time-consuming, and searches are not usually very successful.'</em></p>
	  
    <p>Even when the lecturer had carried out a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of academic hubs and gateways this had <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>fruitless, though librarians too later expressed similar misgivings about both <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and commercial gateways and hubs. One said, <em>'It <span>isn't</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>very clear where they are targeted at the moment, as they aren't as broad as Google, yet neither are they as specific as a subject database, but they kind of <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in between the two.'</em></p>

  
  <ul><li><strong>Impermanence of Web-sites</strong></li></ul> 
  
 <p>A second problem encountered with online resources was their impermanence.   <em>'I had a fantastic piece of a course based on a Website, with quizzes. It had pictures, speeches from politicians etc. and it suddenly       disappeared and so I'd <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>my course.'</em>, said one lecturer. This transience is a well-recognised <span>phenomenon</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> which Brooks (<a href="#bro01">2001</a>) calls &quot;content churn&quot; referring to a study which had found that <em>20% of Web pages are less than twelve days old, while only 25% are older than one year</em>.</p>

    <p>A link in a <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>history module had <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>particularly unpredictable and the lecturer claimed that her <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>seemed to <span>hold</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>her responsible for its impermanence. She noted: </p>
	  
    <blockquote>Some Web-sites' <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>keep breaking. The Chechen ones keep being hacked into by the Russian Government and disappearing and then they come back again, but the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>blame me if they don't work. So I have to explain that this is what politics is like, and there's a war going on. They get a kind of injured innocence if they click on something and it doesn't work.</blockquote>
	
    <p>The lecturer had no strategy for preserving the resource, and suggested that these problems might be overcome if <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Internet resources were managed through the Library Website. Library staff however, who perhaps more thoroughly <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the implications of <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>on this task, were reluctant to do so, and con0ered it inappropriate.</p>
	  

  <ul>
<li><strong>Surfeit of online resources </strong></li> 
</ul>
  
    <p>The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>mentioned <span>difficulty</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> one recognised in the literature, was not for lecturers, but for their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>- a surfeit or over-supply of online material from which to make choices. One lecturer described the effects of the over-abundance of online materials to be digested thus:</p>
	  
    <blockquote>I think it removes one set of problems - you know, the need to go to the library and scanning up and down the shelves - but I think it puts other pressure on them, inasmuch as they've got such a surfeit of information that sometimes it can take as long to weed out and visit the hopeless stuff as to go to the traditional library.</blockquote>
	  
    <p>Others had seen this leading to time management problems. <em>'They tend to cram everything in and overshoot their word count, or they spend ages looking for stuff, and waiting for stuff to get sent to them, and miss their deadline.'</em></p>
	  
    <p>Another perceived the real problem as one of access. </p>
	
    <blockquote>I suspect we don't need any more resources. I think we are <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>rich in subscriptions and provision... but I think the problem is how to make it more accessible to <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> Now whether that means the skill of lecturers being a filtering agent and directing the <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> or whether it becomes something that the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>take on board for themselves ....</blockquote>
	  
    <p>His remark echoes Clarke who says, <em>'...there are so many excellent information providers to turn to that 
the very proliferation of services has itself become a barrier to their access and use.' </em>(<a href="#cla01">2001: 90</a>)</p>
  
 <ul>
 <li><strong>Students' poor information seeking and evaluation skills </strong></li> 
</ul>
  
    <blockquote>We all agree: <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>think the Internet has all the answers, and any and all information that comes off a <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>screen, especially from the Internet, is gospel <span>truth</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>. (<a href="#hah97">Hahn 1997</a>)</blockquote>
	  
    <p>Though written perhaps with tongue in cheek, Hahn's words of five years ago still <span>hold</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>some measure of <span>truth</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> The most <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and most varied discussion of <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>was in answer to questions about <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> and their online information seeking skills. When asked if they encouraged their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the internet to find resources to include in their coursework, all lecturers did so, but few answered with an unequivocal 'Yes'. As one explained, <em>'...we have trouble getting them to <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>between pukka material from (say) an Emerald journal, Amnesty Website, or similar, and stuff from chat rooms that they have picked up with one of their <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>engines.'</em></p>
	  
    <p>This still seems to be a commonly recognised problem. Parnell (<a href="#par01">2001</a>), 
for example, says, <em>'There has been a burgeoning in the amount of information available... however it is apparent that many <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the skills, the technology, the confidence or the will to fully exploit them.'</em></p>
	  
    <p>Most lecturers <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that there was a trade-off between the benefits and the risks of encouraging <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to find online resources for themselves, and some were devising their own ways of addressing the problem in part at least. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Business Studies lecturer had guided <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>through the process of compiling their own resource library of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to the best, relevant sites, but even so, was aware that the problem of critically evaluating the resources remained. <em>'It took a lot of doing'</em> she said, <em>'and some <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>did it while others didn't.'</em> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><span>History</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>lecturer saw compelling <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to undertake information seeking activities as a way of making them less passive; <em>'What we try to do is get them to find some information of their own, root around and see what they can get <span>hold</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of before they come and see me.'</em> while at the same time acknowledging that they often lacked the skills to evaluate what they found. Indeed she <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>perceived Web-sites in a completely different way to books and journals. They would evaluate critically books and articles, but with Web-sites, <em>'...they ... for some reason they just glaze over and <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>it's true. Which is most bizarre!'</em></p>
	  
<p>This opinion was echoed by a Technology lecturer who encouraged <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to use the Web but <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that their critical evaluation skills might be poor, and was ready to help them improve. He said: <em>'Even the Masters <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>- they find trivial things and bring them to me and I have to draw their <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to the fact that they would not bring me this <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of content in a paper based resource.'</em></p>
	  
    <p>This problem is well recognised in both the library and the academic press. Hill and Hannafin, for example, say:</p>
	  
    <blockquote>Con0erable evidence suggests that individuals <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>fail to identify accurately their learning needs, locate relevant resources, evaluate the <span>utility</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of such resources, and evolve their <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and understanding accordingly. Yet these are precisely the skills needed to successfully engage many resource-based <span>approaches</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> (<a href="#hil01">Hill and Hannafin, 2001: 47</a>)</blockquote>
	  
    <p>Bargellini and Bordoni claim a role for librarians in assisting learners to 'critically analyse information they retrieve'. <span>Critical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>evaluation was seen as a key skill which <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>commonly <span>lack</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> though in contrast to the above opinions some lecturers saw the manifestation of this problem in the online <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>as simply an <span>extension</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of what already existed in more 'traditional' environments. They say: </p>
	  
    <blockquote>What I see now with the Internet is just the same <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of problems with critical evaluation that I was aware of before, using texts and literature sources' or 'I often come across instances of blind copying or downloading. However, this is also true of text book material. (Bargellini and Bordoni, <a href="#bar01">2001: 155</a>)</blockquote>
  
  
<ul>
  <li><strong>Lack of clarity over who should be responsible for skills training for <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and lecturers</strong></li>
</ul>
	
  <p>As a solution to the skills problem some lecturers had decided to make skills training an integral part of their online course. Several had found the VTS an excellent skills training resource and used it with their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to help them develop their evaluation skills. Others had <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and developed their own information seeking and evaluation exercises within their VLEs. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><span>Law</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>lecturer who had done this said: </p>
	
  <blockquote>I set up an exercise where they had to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>different databases with the same <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>terms (e.g., Westlaw, Butterworths Direct, Google) and then had to evaluate what they found according to criteria my colleague <span>designed</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> and compare what they got. Apparently the results were eye-opening for the students!</blockquote>
	
  <p>But while all acknowledged the necessity to train <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in the skills of critical evaluation, not all were so ready to take on the responsibility for delivering this training. For some <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>such as Information Science 
or Business and IT <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> critical evaluation is part of their course: <em>'It is an integral part of what we do here, but I can see that it might be more problematic in other parts of the university.'</em> said an Information and Communications lecturer, going on to remark that, <em>'Students often come on my courses with the idea that they are already skilled, but after a couple of weeks they realize that they know very little..'</em></p>
	
  <p>When the critical evaluation of online resources was not an integral part 
of the course, lecturers often expressed resentment at having to expend subject 
<span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>time in such skills training. One said: <em>'Where would the time come from to do this? It's not really a part of their academic area. It would be an add-on for which they would not be paid.'</em></p>
	
  <p>Allied to this was a sense that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>would not 'buy into' skills training with any great enthusiasm. <em>'It's an extra, so no marks, no incentive to them to sign up for  it.'</em></p>
	
  <p>Only one lecturer acknowledged that he did not have the skills to deliver such training, saying, <em>'Tutors do not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>have the right skill set, nor do they always want to spend time acquiring it...'</em></p>
	
  <p>Nor was there great confidence that Government moves to embed IT literacy skills in the <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>curriculum from an early age (seen as 'one hour a week and three to a machine') would produce a generation of new undergraduates with all the required skills for good online information retrieval in the academic <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>
	
<h3>Phase 2 - Library staff consultation</h3>
  
  <p>As it had become apparent from <span>speaking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to lecturers that most did not <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>librarians as a <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>source of help and information on online resources for their online <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>modules, it was decided to ask librarians how they disseminated information about the resources they managed and the skills they had to offer to lecturers and learners.</p>
	
<h4>Dissemination routes</h4>

    <p>The most usual dissemination route was some kind of formal channel and a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of these were in place, including training initiatives for undergraduates, postgraduates, or research supervisors, staff development presentations at Learning and Teaching events, and through Course Committees. It was noted, however, that when general 'updating sessions' had been <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to academics, generally very few lecturers attended. Some librarians felt that older academics particularly were 'stuck in their ways' and 'haven't been in0e a library in years' even wondering if 'they went in ten years ago and had a bad experience.' Their fear was that that this perceived <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of interest in the library and its services might rub off on to students; one said regretfully, <em>'I think if somebody doesn't really use the libraries themselves, then perhaps that attitude carries <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>on to the <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>'</em></p>
	
  <p>On a more positive note, one librarian suggested that the dissemination of information to <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>about the online resources available through the Library Web-site in particular did not need to come through academic staff. Her belief was that the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>dissemination route was the Library enquiry desk, where <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>can ask a subject librarian for help with a specific assignment.</p>
	
  <blockquote>...the student comes and asks the question, 'How can I find information on...?' And in my experience that's how <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>find out about the resources that we have to offer, and there's a huge ignorance from the majority of the academic staff... </blockquote>
	
  <p>Another positive development had been a recent informal initiative offering one-to-one help sessions for academics. These had <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>very successful. Two most interesting reasons were given to explain this apparent success:</p>
	
  <blockquote>I think colleagues have been focussing more on one-to-one sessions recently, in the hope that perhaps people will be prepared to admit that they don't know things, or maybe they feel that they can ask the questions that are really going to be useful to their work without having to sit and listen to half an hour or an hour of more general things.</blockquote>
	
  <p>This tied in with the remarks about the value of one-to-one advice given     to <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>at the library enquiry desk. It seems that <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to a very focussed need engaged the learner, whether student or academic, in a way that more general dissemination did not. </p>
	
  <p>It might seem that one-to-one <span>attention</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> although undoubtedly very fruitful, must make huge demands on resources. Yet this was not perceived as a problem simply because the demand for help was so low, and did not currently impinge upon the librarians carrying out their many other duties to the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>they serve. It was acknowledged though that if demand grew dramatically, under current provision library staff might be unable to support it. One possible solution suggested was to revise the way library posts were funded, based on the model of one University Department, which <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>funds its own librarian. She is not required to undertake generic library duties and had  been able, therefore, to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>her time on the needs of Departmental lecturing staff, 50% of whom had had one-to-one assistance in choosing resources for their <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> She had a high profile in the Department, and was much valued.</p>
	
<h4>Information skills training</h4>

<p>The views of lecturers on the information skills of themselves and their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>echoed an on-going debate in the library <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>about who should deliver information skills training to <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> Brophy, for example, found that: </p>
	
  <blockquote>On the one hand the course tutor, responsible for the <span>design</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> delivery 
    and assessment of the course, seems the obvious candidate, but he or she may 
    not have the necessary expertise. Librarians have long called for the role 
    to be given to them, and resourced accordingly. (Brophy, <a href="#bro01">2001: 147</a>)</blockquote>
	
  <p>However Brophy and others comment that librarians often encounter hostility from lecturers to the idea that they might take on a <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>role. Powis and Payne (<a href="#pow01">2001:30</a>), go so far as to say that Library staff are often engaged in a (usually) unspoken battle with academics and others to <span>prove</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that they have a role in the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning process.</p>
	
  <p>Library staff do of course provide some formal skills training for students; library induction sessions for new undergraduate and postgraduates, <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>by information skills sessions <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>at various stages of the student's university career, and at the request of the course tutor. In contrast to the lecturer who thought that library induction sessions provided <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>training for her <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> library staff saw these simply as 'taster sessions'. </p>
	
  <blockquote>We just want to plant in their <span>minds</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that this resource is there, the library resource is there and the Web-site is where to start... and we're emphasising that more and more and I think it's going to feed through <span>eventually</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span></blockquote>
  
  <p>The information skills sessions, a more focused group follow-up to student induction, were a developing area which it was hoped would help consolidate the 'taster' experience, perhaps by linking the skills session to an assignment. </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  
  <p>Although much further work needs to be done in this area before firm conclusions can be <span>drawn</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> it is apparent from this small study that this group of lecturers who are using VLEs as a <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>tool are discovering for themselves the <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of problems which librarians and information professionals have been aware of for some time. In this particular instance, many do not seem to be turning to library staff for help, and as the problems are 'locked away' in password-protected VLEs, it is difficult for librarians to identify and evaluate emerging <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and to intercede in a timely and appropriate fashion. There is undoubtedly a keenness to use online information resources as <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>tools, but this seems to be matched by a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of awareness of how best to integrate these resources into the online <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>environment. </p>
	
  <p>A librarian or information professional skilled in the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and management of high-quality online resources has much to offer the lecturer <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>into the online <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>environment for course delivery. But if the librarian 
is to impact upon this new <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>it seems that he or she may need to heed Burge's advice (<a href="#bur02">2002</a>) to, 'introduce yourself as an innovation to make their (lecturers') lives easier and their academic reputations bigger.'</p>
	
  <p>Those lecturers who do use the services of library staff on a one-to-one basis to help them identify and manage online resources do indeed find such help invaluable. So the solution seems to lie in achieving co-operation. However, for this particular institution and perhaps others like it, new <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of co-operation focussed on individual need as well as on generic skills may be required, at least until the information management skills needed to prosper in the digital <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>become more widespread. How this might be <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>within organisational constraints remains the challenge to be addressed.</p>
	
  <p>In the educational <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> the emergence of new technologies for course delivery has triggered new challenges for key stakeholders: lecturers and library staff and for the learners whom they serve. But the technology, however engaging and efficient, can only deliver so much. As Roberts and Davey (<a href="#rob02">2002</a>) say, <em> 'The development of relationships within the new academic team is 
the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>critical success factor, and not the technological advances, which are simply the <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to make it happen.'</em></p>
	
  <p>It is people both in groups and as individuals, and their willingness to form new alliances and grapple with new skills, who will determine the success or otherwise of a tool which promises so much for the learner.</p>

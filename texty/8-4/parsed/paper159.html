<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>Bruce, a well-known Australian information literacy researcher, 
  notes:</p>
   
<blockquote>The idea of information literacy, emerging with the advent of information technologies in the early 1970s, has grown, taken shape and strengthened to become recognized as the critical literacy for the twenty-first century. 
<span>Sometimes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>interpreted as one of a number of literacies, information literacy is also described as the overarching literacy <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>for twenty-first century living. Today, information literacy is inextricably associated with information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and critical thinking in the information and communication technology <span>environment</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> (<a href="#bru02">Bruce, 2002</a>).</blockquote>
  
  <p>Indeed, since 1974 information literacy has been an area of increasing interest to librarians and information 
professionals and there is a huge amount of literature on the <span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> However, the majority of publications have come from the industrialised, English-speaking countries, especially from the United States and Australia. </p>
  
<p>The information literacy movement in the United States (<a href="#beh94">Behrens, 1994</a>; <a href="#doy94">Doyle, 1994</a>; <a href="#bre98">Breivik, 1998</a>; <a href="#spi98">Spitzer, <em>et al.</em>, 1998</a>; <a href="#sea01">Seaman, 2001</a>; <a href="#mcc01">McCartin &amp; Feid, 2001</a>) and Australia (<a href="#bru00">Bruce &amp; Candy, 2000</a>; <a href="#bru01">Bruce, 2001</a>; <a href="#cau01">CAUL, 
2001</a>) is quite extensively analysed and discussed and there have been significant initiatives in these countries. In the United States the National Forum on Information Literacy was <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in 1989, the Institute for Information Literacy in 1998, while two sets of information literacy standards were developed for the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>sector and the higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>sector. The United States Department of Education included information literacy in its national <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>technology plan as one of five goals in December 2000. The importance of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>being able to access and evaluate information is also highlighted in several other strategic <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#spi98">Spitzer, et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#ril00">Riley, <em>et al.</em>, 2000</a>; <a href="#mui01">Muir &amp; Oppenheim, 2001</a>; <a href="#koc01">Koch, 2001</a>).</p> 
  
  <p>Examples of how information literacy initiatives and standards have been applied in the United States can be found at various levels. At the state level, for example, Colorado, Wisconsin, and Oregon have adopted standards and several initiatives have been developed by state-wide <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of higher <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> including SUNY Information Literacy Initiative, the California State University System Information Competence Project, Wisconsin and the University of Massachusetts. Individual colleges and <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>have also implemented standards. Some of these are Earlham College, Kings College, University of Louisville, University of Washington, University of Iowa, and Florida International University (<a href="#sna02">Snavely, 2002</a>; <a href="#wil01">Wilson, 2001</a>). </p>
  
<p>The concept of information literacy has also permeated strategic thinking in Australia (<a href="#mui01">Muir &amp; Oppenheim, 2001</a>) and has been highlighted in several <span>influential</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>reports produced by the higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>sector and by the government. The Council of Australian University Librarians (CAUL) has developed 
information literacy standards adapted from the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) ones (<a href="#cau01">CAUL, 2001</a>) and information literacy <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>have been integrated into many university institutional plans. For example, the Central Queensland University (CQU) distance <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>information literacy programme has been a <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>for numerous grants and recognised as a flagship programme internationally, as well as within Australia (<a href="#bru00">Bruce &amp; Candy, 2000</a>), the University of Ballarat's policy documentation identifies information literacy as a key graduate outcome and as an integral part of an undergraduate curriculum model (<a href="#rad00">Radomski, 2000</a>) and the University of Wollongong has reported progress on <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information literacy into the curriculum (<a href="#wri00">Wright &amp; McGurk, 2000</a>).</p> 

  <p>From 1992, successful national conferences on information literacy have been conducted every two years by the University of South Australia and the Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA). In 2001 a joint Australian and New Zealand Institute for Information Literacy (ANZIIL) was <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#cau01">CAUL, 2001</a>) and the ALIA released a <em>Statement on Information Literacy for all Australians </em>endorsing the importance of information literacy from a personal, political, economic and global <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#bun02">Bundy, 2002</a>). It should also be mentioned that valuable research related to information literacy is being done in Australia. </p>
  
<p>There are also references to information literacy developments in Canada, China, Japan, Mexico, Namibia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa (<a href="#whi02">Whitehead. &amp; Quinlan, 2002</a>; <a href="#spi98">Spitzer, <em>et al.</em>, 1998</a>; <a href="#mui01">Muir &amp; Oppenheim, 2001</a>; <a href="#rad02a">Rader, 2002a</a>; <a href="#ino97">Inoue, <em>et al.</em>, 1997</a>; <a href="#mor00">Morgan, 2000</a>; <a href="#moo00">Moore, 2000</a>; <a href="#lia01">LIANZA, 2001</a>; 
<a href="#hep00a">Hepworth, 2000a</a>; <a href="#kar00">Karelse, 2000</a>). References to information literacy initiatives in Europe are, however, quite rare and fragmented. The majority of publications have come from the United Kingdom. Part of the problem of understanding European information literacy activities stems from the language barrier. Many information literacy initiatives have been, for example, documented only in local <span>languages</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>- in Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish, Swedish and other <span>languages</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>- but 
not in <span>English</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> The examples of the most cited and well-known initiatives are the European Commission funded projects EDUCATE and DEDICATE coordinated by Nancy Fj&auml;llbrant, from the <span>Chalmers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>University of Technology in Sweden and a research project for a doctoral thesis on information seeking and use in a learning context by Louise Limberg, from the Swedish School of Library and Information Studies in Bor&aring;s. </p>

<p>In 2000 Charles Sturt University published <em>Information literacy around the world: advances in programs and research</em>, edited by Bruce and Candy, which includes the examples mentioned above. In addition, Mutch of Nottingham Trent University, con0ers the nature of information literacy in the workplace (<a href="#bru00">Bruce &amp; Candy, 2000</a>).</p>
  
<p>However, during recent years there has been <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>interest in information literacy in Europe. This can be illustrated by the number of projects, conferences, workshops, working groups, adaptation of information 
literacy competency standards, <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>initiatives in many institutions, development of Web sites and Web-based tutorials, and in the area of research. </p>
  
<p>This paper will give an overview of some of the developments in information literacy in Europe and is <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>into four parts. The first is an overview of the concepts used and discussed by European authors. The second gives 
some examples of information literacy initiatives in <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>sector. The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>examines institutions and organizations, projects and conferences concerned with information literacy. The fourth part of the paper introduces some research initiatives. The overview is based on literature reviews and personal 
observations and involvement.

<p>Throughout the ages, the crosscurrents of history, culture, economics and politics  have defined Europe differently and several geographical, political, economic and social <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>exist that are still open to interpretation (<a href="#wil95">Wilson &amp; van der Dussen, 1995</a>; <a href="#lov99">Lovatt, 1999</a>). However, the first usage seems to be simple and that is geography: the idea of a stretch of land that extends from the Atlantic through to the Ural Mountains and <span>constitutes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>a geographical <span>entity</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>called Europe. In Greek mythology, Europa was a beautiful woman, the daughter of a Phoenician king, and it is <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that this continent has been named after her. The second use of the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>Europe generally <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to a whole set of values: the system of <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>or <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that are seen to characterize what Europe is all about, politically, socially, culturally. It focuses on concepts like Christendom, liberal democracy, and the idea that everybody should have a say in the decision-making of government (<a href="#kel03">Kelly, 2003</a>). In this article the geographical definition of Europe is <span>followed</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>The information-literacy movement in European countries, similar to other countries, has evolved from precursors such as library instruction, bibliographic instruction and user/reader <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#fja84">Fj&auml;llbrant &amp; Malley, 1984</a>; <a href="#rog94">Rogers, 1994</a>; <a href="#fja00a">Fj&auml;llbrant, 2000a</a>; <a href="#hom01">Homann, 2001</a>; <a href="#sin03">Sinikara &amp; J&auml;rvel&auml;inen, 2003</a>). Although the majority of information literacy initiatives and programmes 
in Europe have been initiated in recent years, academic librarians in Europe have been involved in user <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>for many years. During the 1970s and 1980s, many academic libraries in the United Kingdom, <span>Germany</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and Scandinavia started fairly ambitious programmes of user <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> bibliographic instruction, or reader <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and they have provided user <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in the form of one or more of the following: short orientation courses in the use of the library, its information resources and catalogues for new <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> and courses in information 
literacy for undergraduate and/or for postgraduate <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#fja00a">Fj&auml;llbrant, 
2000a</a>; <a href="#hom01">Homann, 2001</a>). </p>
  
<p>Increasing <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to information literacy in recent years is partly the result of information overload, especially related to the <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of digital information, which has even caused a new ailment called as 'information 
fatigue syndrome' (IFS) (<a href="#wil01">Wilson, 2001</a>) and partly because of the new <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on student learning in a lifelong learning context. It has also created a need for a reconceptualisation of the <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and responsibilities of library and information professionals in a new learning <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> Although there has always been a need to find, evaluate, and effectively use information, the <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>needed to do so have just grown <span>larger</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> more complex, and more important in the information and communication technology (ICT) <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> There is also a shift towards broader <span>contexts</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> to connect information literacy with an active, effective and responsible citizenship supporting personal empowerment and an enriched life through lifelong learning (<a href="#hep00a">Hepworth, 2000a;</a> <a href="#hep00b">2000b</a>; <a href="#cor02">Correia, 2002</a>) 
and as an important factor in the corporate sector (<a href="#mut00">Mutch, 2000</a>).</p>

<p>In this context, several reports have <span>emphasized</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the importance of <span>finding</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> evaluating, and using information although the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>information literacy is not used (<a href="#ert95">ERT, 1995</a>; <a href="#ert97">1997</a>; <a href="#oec96">OECD, 1996</a>; <a href="#oec01a">2001a</a>; <a href="#oec01b">2001b</a>; <a href="#oec01c">2001c</a>). For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and <span>Development</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(OECD), 
representing twenty-two European and <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>other countries, has highlighted the role of information-related competencies in several reports. The report <em>The Knowledge-based Economy</em>, discussing the increasing demand for more highly skilled workers, includes the following observation:</p>
  
<blockquote>The knowledge-based economy is characterised by the need for continuous learning of both codified information and the competencies to use this information. As access to information becomes easier and less expensive, the skills and competencies relating to the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and efficient use of information become more <span>crucial</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>.. Capabilities for selecting relevant and discarding irrelevant information, recognising patterns in information, interpreting and decoding information as well as learning new and forgetting old skills are in increasing demand. (<a href="#oec96">OECD, 1996: 13</a>). </blockquote>
  
<p>Another report, <em>Learning to Bridge the Digital Divide</em>, put it this way: '...the skills of <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and interpreting information are seen to be more important than the skills of retention and recording...' 
(<a href="#oec00">OECD, 2000: 15</a>) and,</p> 

<blockquote>...the ability to seek and exchange information using data bases and networks is not simply dependent on access to technology, but <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>possession</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of the necessary technical skills. In addition, it calls for basic competence in being able to choose, classify and critically evaluate the information that becomes accessible. (<a href="#oec00">OECD, 2000: 102</a>) </blockquote>

<p>The report also expressed <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that many <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>experience in information handling and in effective independent learning (<a href="#oec00">OECD, 2000: 72</a>) and encourages <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to develop the learning <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in ways that give <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>a more active role, that 'support the ability to find information and transform it into knowledge' and provide skills 'how to find interesting, relevant and <span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>information, and how to work with it' (<a href="#oec00">OECD, 2000: 104</a>). </p>
  
<p>The OECD's <em>Educational Policy Analysis 2001</em> states: <em>'The knowledge economy is based on the production and use of information and knowledge... The ability to produce and use information effectively is thus a vital <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of skills for many individuals.'</em> (<a href="#oec01a">OECD, 2001a: 100</a>). And again, the report <em>Learning to Change: ICT in Schools</em> notes: <em>'In a world with easy access to huge stores of information, the skills of accessing, handling and using data and materials become more important than the ability to recall in detail ever greater <span>amounts</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>across many fields of knowledge.'</em> (<a href="#oec01b">OECD, 2001b: 19</a>). However, information-handling skills are seen in this report as a part of digital literacy. </p>
  
<p>The European Commission's draft <em>A Memorandum on Lifelong Learning</em> notes: </p>
  
<blockquote>Europe has moved towards a knowledge-based society and economy. More than ever before, access to up-to-date information and knowledge, together with the motivation and skills to use these resources intelligently on behalf of oneself and the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>as a whole, are becoming the key to strengthening Europe's competitiveness and improving the employability and adaptability of the workforce' (<a href="#ec00">EC, 2000: 5</a>)</blockquote>

<p>and highlights <em>'...learning how to learn, to adapt to change and to make sense of vast information 
flows are now generic skills that everyone should acquire.'</em> (<a href="#ec00">EC, 2000: 11</a>). </p>
  
<p>The members of the European University Association (EUA), the representative organisation of both European <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and national rectors' conferences (its membership includes around 650 members from 45 countries) (<a href="#tab00">Tabatoni, <em>et al.</em>, 2000</a>), reacting to the above mentioned draft note: <em>'Other generic skills put forward by EUA members as important for learners today include: the ability to learn, e.g., by managing the increasing amount of information available at an increasing pace and transforming it into 
knowledge; problem solving; networking.'</em> (<a href="#oma01">O'Mahony, 2001</a>). The report <em>EU Policies and Strategic Change for eLearning in Universities</em> also <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to the importance of using digital information: <em>'...they [students] should be enabled to learn using digital information sources.'</em> (<a href="#coi02">COIMBRA Group of Universities, 2002: 21</a>). </p>

<p>Several European scholars have discussed the concepts of information literacy and information skills. For example, the relationship between user <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and information skills is discussed by Fj&auml;llbrant and Malley. They wrote:</p>
  
<blockquote>Those involved in this development [user <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>for schoolchildren] (not all of the work is new) describe the work as 'information skills' (again not new). And although adding new <span>terminology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(or reinterpreting old terminology) to a subject already burdened with varying and often confusing descriptors must be viewed circumspectly, the use of the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>information skills does usefully illuminate the nature of the new <span>emphasis</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> It is an 'umbrella' <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>incorporating study skills, learning skills and communication skills, as well as library skills.... Of course there is nothing entirely new in all this - various librarians have argued along some of these <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>before. What is new is that the personnel involved in this work have emerged the different <span>backgrounds</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> educational research and libraries, bringing with them expertise and specialist knowledge from these different areas. (<a href="#fja84">Fj&auml;llbrant &amp; Malley, 1984: 123</a>).</blockquote>
  
<p>According to Rogers (<a href="#rog94">Rogers, 1994</a>),  many authors argued about the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>
'information skills' in the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Heather (<a href="#hea84">
1984</a>) could find <em>'no general agreement on the boundaries of information skills'</em> in her research review. Brake, <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#bra85">1985</a>)
found the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>too vague 
and confusing. Meek in <em>Developing resource-based learning: one <span>school</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>s 
approach </em>in 1985 seemed to accept the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>but questioned whether there 
was agreement about what the skills <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>were. She proposed that 'information 
skills' should mean skilled behaviour in respect of understanding as a result 
of successful <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>with a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information and if this is so, two 
things result: skills cannot be taught apart from the context of their operation; 
we learn to study by studying, and because they are, in the end, indissolubly 
linked to personal knowledge, there is no set of skills to be 'acquired' as 
if one stretched out a hand and took them from the <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> Instead, they 
are developed as part of personal development (<a href="#rog94">Roger, 1994: 
2-3</a>). Hopkins (<a href="#hop87">1987</a>) found that 
there is an unresolved dichotomy and confusion between the notion of information 
skills as (a) the retrieval and location of information, and (b) the analysis 
and synthesis of information, and the distinction between the two aspects is 
not clearly articulated in the literature. However, by the end of the 1980s, 
two <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information skills were identified: the instrumental, which most 
involved library use, and the <span>cognitive</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> which researchers con0ered more important 
.</p>
  
<p>According to Rogers (<a href="#rog94">1994: 3-4</a>), in 1989 Heeks identified two <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>views: one <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>a greater precision in <span>terminology</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> the other warned against it. For example, in 1985 Meek argued that loosely defined terms such as information technology, study skills, information retrieval, and library skills should be stringently examined for the assumptions they make about <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> learning, and literacy. In 1988,  Best and others, <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that the precise meaning of a relationship between study skills, library skills and information skills was an issue in its own right. Agreeing <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>would not only aid the implementation of specific curriculum innovations, but also help <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to clarify their broad educational position. In contrast,  Lincoln noted in 1987 that the more skills are broken down into categories, the more fragmented is <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> thinking, and the more difficult it is to achieve co-ordination across the <span>school</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> Again, according to Rogers, in 1991, Howard highlighted the continuing confusion and <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of clarity about the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>'information skills' in the UK.</p>
  
<p>During recent years <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>about the terms information literacy and information skills, and the nature of the concepts have intensified again in the UK. There are different <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in using terms 'information literacy' and 'information skills' and many <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>have been suggested by several organisations, institutions and authors. </p>
  
<p>For example, the broadly-based definition of information skills in higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of the Standing Conference of National and University Libraries (SCONUL) Information Skills Task <span>Force</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(now the SCONUL Advisory Committee on Information Literacy (<a href="#alv03">Alvestrand, 2003</a>)) reflects the twin dimensions of the 'competent information user' at the base level and the 'information-literate <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>. For the latter level of information skills, the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>'information literacy' is used. Therefore, both information skills and information technology (IT) skills are seen as <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>parts of the wider concept of information literacy. For the development of the information-literate <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>SCONUL proposes <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>sets of skills. The outline model of information skills generated in the briefing paper has become known as the <em>Seven Pillars Model</em>. The pillars show an iterative process whereby information user progress through competency to expertise by practising the skills (<a href="#bai01">Bainton, 2001</a>). According to a <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>by Town at the first international conference on Information Technology and Information Literacy in Glasgow, in 2002, the SCONUL approach 
to information literacy can be described as follows:</p> 

<blockquote>...information literacy is knowledge rather than simply skill, <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>by <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>rather than training, created through partnership between professionals and is a lifelong endeavour that is contextual in field and service access. (<a href="#tow02a">Town, 2002a</a>)</blockquote> 

<p>The Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) Policy Advisory Groups (PAGs) describe information literacy this way: </p>
  
<blockquote>We have adopted the commonly <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>distinction between information literacy and skills. Information literacy is about providing all members of society with the information competences necessary to function effectively within society - it might be termed functional information literacy. The debate over information skills relates to the higher level competences of information specialists' (<a href="#pag01">PAG, 2001: 15</a>; <a href="#mui01">Muir &amp; Oppenheim, 2001</a>).</blockquote>
  
<p> They define 'information literacy <em>'as a set of basic competencies that should be used by everyone.'</em> </p>
  
<p>Researchers of the UK's Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) funded 'The Big Blue' project, led by the Manchester Metropolitan University and the University of Leeds, find that in many instances both terms are used to describe what is <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the same concept: 'information literacy' and 'information skills' 
can be described as synonyms (<a href="#tbb02">The Big Blue, 2002</a>). Stubbings &amp; Brine (<a href="#stu03">2003</a>) also note that at Loughborough University the phrases information literacy and information skills are both used to convey the same meaning. The <em>Glossary of Information Terms</em> at the British Open University (OU) Library site seems to support the same approach giving the following definition of information literacy: 'a skill that involves being able to use information successfully, including <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>information, searching using various <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(e.g., internet, databases) and being able to critically evaluate the results (<a href="%20html.html#oul03">OU, 2003</a>). </p>
  
<p>Mutch (<a href="#mut96">1996</a>) is concerned that the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>'information literacy' carries overtones of a very tightly defined skill or competence rather than the broader and more complex set of <span>attitudes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and skills which is hinted at above and that there might be a danger that literacy is related very tightly to text and hence back to a view of information as a thing. He suggests that information literacy needs a definition of information which recognises that it is not structured data, nor restricted to the printed word and to formal 
sources, and needs to include insights from varied disciplines. He rather sees the value of the concept of information literacy as a strategic concept (<a href="#mut96">Mutch, 1996</a>; <a href="#mut97">1997</a>; <a href="#baw01">Bawden, 2001</a>). </p>
  
<p>Webber &amp; Johnston define information literacy as an efficient and ethical information behaviour:</p>

<blockquote>...information literacy is the adoption of appropriate information behaviour to <span>obtain</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> through whatever channel or <span>medium</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> information well fitted to information needs, together with critical awareness of the importance of wise and ethical use of information in society. (Webber &amp; Johnston, <a href="#Web02">2002</a>)</blockquote>
  
<p>Hepworth (<a href="#hep00b">Hepworth, 2000b</a>, <a href="#hep00c">2000c</a>) highlights two <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to information literacy that are evident: the most common tries to identify discrete skills and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that can be learnt and <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and highlights works of Doyle (<a href="#doy92">1992</a>), the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (<a href="#acr00">ACRL, 2000</a>) and the SCONUL approach (<a href="#sco99">SCONUL, 1999</a>). The other <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the information literate mindset associated with how an individual experiences and makes sense of his/her world, the work of Bruce illustrates this approach . 
This analysis seems to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to some extent the <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>identified by Bruce (<a href="#bru97">1997</a>) and is described as the behavioural, constructivist and <span>relational</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>approaches to information literacy.</p>
  
<p>Boekhorst (<a href="#boe03">2003</a>), from the Netherlands, finds that all <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and descriptions of information literacy presented over the years can be summarized in three concepts:</p>

<ul>
<li> The ICT concept: Information literacy <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to the competence to use ICT to retrieve and disseminate information. </li>
<li>The information (re)sources concept: information literacy <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to the competence to find and use information <span>independently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>or with the aid of intermediaries.</li>
<li> The information process concept: information literacy <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to the process of recognizing information need, retrieving, evaluating, using and disseminating of information to acquire or extend knowledge. This concept includes both the ICT and the information (re)sources concept and persons are con0ered as information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that retrieve, evaluate, process and disseminate information to make decisions to survive, for self-actualisation and development.</li>
</ul>

<p>He also sees the process of becoming information literate as a lifelong endeavour that should be started at <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>school and be a part of formal training in all phases and all subject areas during the whole <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>process and suggests the con0eration of information literacy/illiteracy in information-rich versus information-poor context (<a href="#boe03">Boekhorst, 2003</a>).</p>
  
<p>The Norwegian scholars, Audunson &amp; Nordlie (<a href="#aud03">2003</a>) also highlight three <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>categories of information literacy: they describe <em>technical</em> capabilities or what one might call <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>literacy; <em>intellectual</em> capabilities related to traditional literacy; and <em>communicative</em> competency 
that presupposes technical as well as intellectual capabilities, and at the same time transcends them. For each dimension they also <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>several levels of competence, from basic competence to super-user competence to in-depth competence and <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>information literacy as the <span>sum</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of different 'literacies'.</p>
  
<p>Hepworth concludes: 'Gradually we are seeing increasingly <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>descriptions and greater consensus about what is meant by information literacy; however different communities tend to describe the <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in slightly different ways with varying degrees of comprehensiveness' (Hepworth, <a href="#hep00b">2000b: 23</a>).</p>
  
<p>Bawden, who attempts to relate information literacy to the full context of all the other relevant literacies, argues that the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>'information literacy' has been widely and confusingly used in the literature. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>number of other related terms have also been used for the same, or similar, concepts including <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>literacy (or information technology literacy, electronic literacy or electronic information literacy); library literacy; media literacy (or 'mediacy'); <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>literacy (or Internet literacy or hyper-literacy); digital literacy (digital information literacy); informacy (<a href="#baw01">Bawden, 2001</a>). Bawden and Robinson also find it helpful to <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>between 'skills-based literacies', such as <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>or library literacy, which <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>indicate 
a competence in handling information in a particular <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>or context or format, and more general capabilities. These wider conceptions of information literacy stress capabilities beyond a simple competence in retrieving or communicating information. They highlight that to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>with the complexities of the current information <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> a complex and broad form of literacy is required. It must subsume all the skill-based literacies, but cannot be restricted to them, nor can it be restricted to any particular technology or set of technologies, and understanding, meaning and context must be <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to it (<a href="#baw01">Bawden, 2001</a>; <a href="#baw01b">Bawden &amp; Robinson, 2001</a>).</p>
  
<p>Muir &amp; Oppenheim, following the world-wide developments on national information policy, also have to conclude that information literacy 'has no agreed definition' and 'a number of people have <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>their views on 
what they think information literacy is' (<a href="#mui01">Muir &amp; Oppenheim, 2001: 172</a>). In the UK context, a need for an agreed definition of the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>'information literacy', and the need to <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>it from 'information skills', is highlighted as well (<a href="#pag02">PAG, 2002: 45</a>). </p>
  
<p>Several other terms and combinations of terms have been also used by different authors: 'infoliteracy', 'informacy', 'information empowerment' 'information competence', 'information competency', 'information competencies', 'information literacy skills', 'information literacy and skills', 'skills of information literacy', 'information literacy competence', 'information literacy competencies', 'information competence skills', 'information handling skills', 'information problem <span>solving</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>, 'information problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>skills', 'information fluency', 'information mediacy' and even 'information mastery' was proposed by Bill Nisen, Director of the e-Institute of the Strathclyde/Glasgow University, during the first conference on Information Technology and Information Literacy in Glasgow in 2002. Finnish researcher Reijo Savolainen suggests the umbrella <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>'information-related competences' that covers information literacy, media competence and library skills and adds: 'Because new labels describing specific <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of literacies are continually <span>introduced</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> reflecting the developments of ICTs, the attempts to develop an <span>exact</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information-related literacies seem to be futile' (<a href="#sav02">Savolainen, 2002</a>). However, despite of the continuous <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>about the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>since 1990s, information literacy is still the most commonly used phrase to describe the concept (<a href="#baw01">Bawden, 
2001</a>). </p>
  
<p>In several countries the terms used for information literacy clearly refer to competencies. For example, in Denmark the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><em>informationskompetence</em>, in Finland <em>informaatiokompetenssi</em> (also <em>informaatiolukutaito</em>), in <span>Germany</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><em>informationskompetenz</em>, in Norway <em>informasjonskompetanse</em> and in Sweden <em>informationskompetens</em> have been used for information literacy. </p>
  
<p>Therefore, the definition and understanding of the concept seems to be related to the way in which the concepts of competence and skills are defined and perceived. The concept of competence also has different meanings and it is not always clear whether competence <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to identifiable skills, or is it related to patterns 
of behaviour. <em>The New Oxford <span>Dictionary</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span></em>defines: 'competence (also competency) - the ability to do something successfully or efficiently; the scope of a <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>s or group's knowledge or ability; a skill or ability'. The <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>skill is defined as a <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>s 'ability to do something well' and also as 'an expertise' (<a href="#nod01">NODE, 2001</a>). It seems that there is no difference between competence and skill and the terms are described as synonyms. Savolainen (<a href="#sav02">2002: 212</a>) points out that there are several 
other concepts closely related to them and belonging to the same family of concepts: 'ability', 'capacity', 'expertise' and 'know-how' and it can be difficult to find out whether these form a conceptual hierarchy or whether they re0e at the same level of <span>generality</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>Finnish researchers Anttiroiko, <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ant01">2001</a>) refer to <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>research <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to the phenomena of competence. Rationalistic theories approach competence as a set of relatively stable attributes possessed by actors or the set of requirements characteristic of specific work. In contrast, 
the interpretative <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>emphasize the importance of the ways in which actors experience the settings of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and construct meanings concerning <span>action</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>categorization</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information literacy <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>by Hepworth (<a href="#hep00b">2000b</a>; <a href="#hep00c">2000c</a>), cited earlier, also seems to fit into this <span>framework</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> However, Finnish researchers conclude that competence has two dimensions - knowledge and skills.</p> 

<blockquote>Knowledge may be seen as our understanding of how our everyday world is constituted and how it works. Skills involve the ability to pragmatically apply, consciously or even unconsciously, our knowledge in <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>settings. In this <span>setting</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> 'skills' can be conceived as the technical aspects of competence, emphasizing the aspect of 'how to do'. (<a href="#ant01">Anttiroiko, <em>et al.</em>, 2001: 3</a>1).</blockquote> 

<p>Several European scholars, mainly <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the library and information science (LIS) <span>discipline</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> however, approach competence as a quite <span>complicated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>phenomenon and also <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>between competence and competency (<a href="#kee92">Keen, 1992</a>; <a href="#che96">Cheetham &amp; Chivers, 1996</a>, <a href="#che98">1998</a>, <a href="#che00">2000</a>; <a href="#kir97">Kirschner, <em>et al.</em>, 1997</a>; <a href="#kop00">Koper, 2000</a>). </p>
  
<p>Keen (<a href="#kee92">1992</a>), for example, notes that competencies refer to the ability to operate in ill-defined and ever-changing environments, to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>with non-routine and <span>abstract</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>work processes, to handle decisions and responsibilities, to work in groups, to understand dynamic <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> and to operate within expanding 
geographical and time horizons. In other words, competencies are a <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of complex <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>skills (that encompass problem <span>solving</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>reasoning, and higher-order skills such as self-regulation and learning-to-learn), highly integrated knowledge structures (e.g., <span>mental</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>models), interpersonal skills and social <span>abilities</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>values</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> In addition, competencies <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the ability to flexibly coordinate these different aspects of competent behaviour.

<p>In a learning <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> according to the researchers of the Dutch Open University, competencies can be construed as the <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that enable learners to recognize and define new problems in their <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of study and <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>work as well as to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>these problems. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>competency is the ability, within a certain (professional 
or academic) <span>domain</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> to make use of already learnt as well as new knowledge and skills across traditional subject areas to adequately <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>real-life, poorly-defined problems. These competencies are made up of component knowledge, skills and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#kir97">Kirschner, et al., 1997</a>). Rob Koper (<a href="#kop00">2000:10</a>) puts it this way: </p>
  
<blockquote>I <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>a competency to be the ability to act consciously and responsibly in a specific context. By 'consciously' I mean man's ability to freely choose how to act, and to do so with a certain <span>passion</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and attitude. The <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>is dependent on an assessment of the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and on specific <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>motives such as interests, <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>or the need to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>a problem. With 'responsibly' I am referring to people's ability to justify their choices and actions, and explain them to others, without putting it down to circumstances beyond their control or automatic behaviour, but rather to their own, carefully con0ered <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and choices. In using these terms I wish 
to clarify that I view a competency as the <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>cognitive</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> conative and affective aspects that collectively determine behaviour in a given <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> Which competencies are involved always <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and the <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>within that <span>domain</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> And he concludes that there is, as yet, no conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that is widely <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in this area (<a href="#kop00">Koper, 2000: 38</a>).</blockquote>
  
<p>Cheetham &amp; Chivers (<a href="#che96">1996</a>; <a href="#che00">2000</a>) from the UK have also reviewed a number of alternative <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to competence which had been applied to professional occupations. These are: </p>
  
<ul>
  <li>The reflective practitioner approach, which focuses on tacit-knowledge and its application and advocates reflection as a key tool of both professional development and practice. </li>
  <li>The technical-rational approach, which focuses on <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>underpinning professional knowledge and theory as a basis for application. </li>
  <li>Functional competence, typically embedded within occupational standards, which focuses on tasks to be performed and functional skills, rather than personal attributes or behaviour. </li>
  <li>Personal competence, which focuses on the personal attributes required for effective <span>performance</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> </li>
  <li>Meta-competence, which stresses the importance of competencies that enable individuals to monitor and develop other competencies, or that span other competencies, enhancing or mediating them.</li>
</ul>

<p>Many publications, however, do not adequately define the <span>exact</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>nature of the concept to which they are referring. Different terms are also used interchangeably and it is not always clear what different authors mean by the terms 'competence' and 'skill'. For example, if the terms competence and skill are defined as synonyms, 
as well as information literacy and information skills, and information literacy is defined as 'a set of competencies' then it is not always easy to understand the meaning of phrases such as 'information competence skills' 'information literacy skills', 'skills of information literacy', 'information literacy and skills' or 'information literacy competence/competencies' used by the same authors. Savolainen (<a href="#sav02">2002</a>) points out that concepts such as 'competence' and 'skill' are taken as given and most researchers seem to <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that the 
meanings of these concepts are self-explanatory or sufficiently well-known from everyday <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> In the UK context the report <em>Work Skills in Britain 1986-2001</em> also notes:</p> 

<blockquote>Despite the enormous interest in how skills in Britain have changed over time, how they are distributed, and how these trends and patterns compare with <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>nations, there is surprisingly little agreement on what 'skills' <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>refer to.  In practice, different authors often refer to different aspects of skill and they are <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>by the theoretical standpoint (economic, sociological or <span>psychological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>point of view) from which their interest in the <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>stems. (<a href="#fel02">Felstead <em>et al.</em>, 2002</a>).</blockquote>

<p>Part of the problem, pointed out by Cheuk (<a href="#cheu00">2000</a>), a researcher from Singapore, not from Europe, is also that the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>'information literacy' is made up of two problematic words - 'information' and 'literacy' which also has no agreed meaning. 'Information' has been defined in several <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>ways and recent <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of literacy have <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the traditional view of the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to include comprehending the meaning of the words that we read or write. For example, the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS) defines literacy in terms of proficiency levels of the use of information to function in society and in the economy. Literacy is defined as a particular capacity and <span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of behaviour, the ability to understand and employ printed information in daily activities, at home, at work and in the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>- to achieve <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>goals, and to develop <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>knowledge and potential (<a href="#oecs00">OECD/Statistics Canada, 2000:12</a>). In IALS literacy is <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>operationally in terms of the three domains: prose literacy, document literacy and quantitative literacy. Five levels of literacy are defined:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li> Level 1 indicates persons with very poor skills, where the individual may, for example, be unable to determine the correct amount of medicine to give a child from information printed on the package.</li>
  <li> Level 2 respondents can <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>only with material that is simple, clearly laid out, and in which the tasks involved are not too complex. It denotes a weak level of skills, but more hidden than Level 1. It identifies people who can read, but <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>poorly. They may have developed coping skills to manage everyday literacy demands, but their low level of proficiency makes it difficult for them to face <span>novel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>demands, such as learning new job skills. </li>
  <li>Level 3 is con0ered a <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>minimum for coping with the demands of everyday life and work in a complex, <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>society. It denotes roughly the skill level required for successful <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>school completion and college entry. Like higher levels, it <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the ability to integrate several sources of information and <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>more complex problems. </li>
  <li>Level 4 and 5 describe respondents who demonstrate command of higher-order information processing skills (<a href="#oecs00">OECD/Statistics Canada, 2000:  xi</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Dramatically, however, according to the report, in all the countries and <span>regions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>surveyed, at least one of every four adults fails to reach minimum literacy levels for coping with everyday life and work in <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>societies (<a href="#oecs00">OECD/Statistics Canada, 2000</a>). </p>
  
<p>Several observers have expressed <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that putting two fuzzy terms together does not make the overall concept clearer. Others assert that it does not matter what you call or define it, as long as it gets done. However, a leading Australian information literacy promoter, Alan Bundy, notes: </p> 

<blockquote>The more that librarians and their associations can <span>agree</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <span>terminology</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> definition, standards for, assessment of, and importance of information literacy at a local, national and global level, the greater will be the prospect of their success in elevating the issue over the next 25 years to one of <span>universal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and better educational and library resourcing. (<a href="#bun02">Bundy, 2002</a>).</blockquote>
  
<p>Unfortunately, it has to be said that in Europe 'information literacy' consciousness as well as the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>has spread mainly among librarians and information professionals and neither is explicitly and extensively recognized in other <span>circles</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> For example, Town notes: <em>'At the UK national level the need for information skills in the 
information society and the concept of information literacy are not explicitly recognized'</em> (<a href="#tow02b">Town, 2002b: 91</a>). Homann (<a href="#hom03">2003</a>) writes that in <span>Germany</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><em>Informationskompetenz</em> (a translation of 'information literacy') is <em>'predominantly used by librarians and information scientists and the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><em>medienkompetenz</em> or media competency is mainly used by experts in pedagogy and information technology'</em>. The meanings are similar but not <span>identical</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> Danish information literacy initiators, Skov &amp; Sk&#509;rbak (<a href="#sko03">2003</a>) also report that discourse analysis reveals that <em>informationskompetence</em> (the Danish analogue for information literacy) is 'a 'floating signifier', a <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>open to interpretation, and one that means different things to different people', even among librarians. The <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>is used mainly in the library sector in Denmark and <em>'has not yet made its way into the <span>vocabulary</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of the official publications outlining <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>for acquiring the competencies needed in the knowledge society'</em>.</p> 

<p>In the Norwegian educational sector, although governmental <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>responsible for ICT policies as well as the LIS sector have been preoccupied with topics and problems falling under the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>'information literacy', there 
is no one, single <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>integrating these topics and problems under one umbrella (<a href="#aud03">Audunson &amp; Nordlie, 2003</a>). In Spain, the related terms, concepts and services for information competence are present in research and practice during the 1990s, but the Spanish <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and concept for information literacy <em>alfabetizaci&oacute;n informacional </em>only begins to appear in the LIS literature around 2000 (<a href="#gom03">G&oacute;mez Hern&aacute;ndez &amp; Pasadas Ure&ntilde;a, 2003</a>). Twelve European open and distance learning leaders were interviewed by the author during the annual conference of the European 
Association of Distance Teaching Universities (EADTU) in Glamorgan, Wales, in 2002, yet only a few of those interviewed had any understanding of what information literacy might be. </p>
  
<p>However, among many <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>perhaps the most widely <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and cited in Europe is that provided by the American Library Association (ALA) Pre0ential Committee on Information Literacy: <em>'To be information literate, a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>must be able to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed information'</em> (<a href="#ala89">ALA, 1989: 1</a>). Although alternative <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information literacy have been <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>by several institutions, organizations and individuals, there are strong similarities between the various <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and they are likely to stem from the definition <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>by ALA. </p>
  
<p>The author, focussing in her research on the higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>sector and, more specifically, on online learning, prefers to use the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>'information-related competencies', as it combines several blocks of competencies related to information handling and use; for example, identifying, locating, gathering, selecting, storing, recording, retrieving and processing information from a variety of sources and media; developing successful information seeking and retrieval strategies; mastering complex and multiple information systems; organizing, analysing, interpreting, evaluating, synthesizing, and using information; and, presenting and communicating information clearly, logically, concisely and accurately. These information-related competencies can be seen as made up of increasingly sophisticated knowledge, skills and <span>attitudes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> The author also <span>believes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that the constructivist approach to learning has close <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>with the process of information-seeking and use. From the 1970s on, research on human cognition as information-processing has revealed the 'constructive' nature of human learning. Learning consists of complex information processing, problem-solving, decision-making in uncertainty and the urge to transfer knowledge and skills into new, <span>unknown</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>settings. Learning is, in this view, defined as an active, constructive, goal-oriented and situated process that <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>intensive <span>mental</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>activity and construction of meaning on the part of the learner (<a href="#dil99">Dillemans <em>et al.</em>, 1999</a>). Therefore, to learn constructively involves active seeking, processing and using of information, critical analysis and metacognition. In this context, information-related competencies may be viewed as context- and content-dependent competencies which are integral elements in a constructive learning <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and are closely related with the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of constructive learners (prior knowledge, metacognition, motivation, and the complex variable 'learning <span>style</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>). However, the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>'information literacy' might be a useful research construct or umbrella <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>covering information-related competencies and also as a strategic concept or goal - a political, economic and educational one. </p>
  
<p>In what follows the terms 'information literacy' and 'information skills' are used as <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to by authors and institutions cited in this literature review. </p>

<h3> Information literacy in schools</h3>

<p>In several countries in Europe information literacy development has been derived from user <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and library instruction in the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>context. Herring (<a href="#her96">1996</a>) notes that in the mid-1980s, there was a flurry of research projects and books on information skills in <span>schools</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> For example, <strong>in Britain</strong>, during the 1980s the British Library Research and <span>Development</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>Department gave priority to <em>'research examining the nature of information skills and illuminating the problems of <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning those skills'</em> (<a href="#kuh90">Kuhlthau, 1990: 23</a>). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of reports on information skills arose out of this work (for example, <a href="#mar81">Marland, 1981</a>; <a href="#hou83">Hounsell &amp; Martin, 1983</a>; <a href="#hop87">Hopkins, 1987</a>). The most significant outcome was Marland's (<a href="#mar81">1981</a>) taxonomy of information skills. According to Corrall &amp; Brewerton (<a href="#cor99">1999</a>), despite its age, this pamphlet remains a standard text for those new to information skills, and is applicable to a variety of settings. It has been the key <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>point for many researchers, teachers and librarians interested in information literacy aspects of the curriculum. Rogers (<a href="#rog94">1994</a>) also notes that much of the additional research carried out since its publication confirms that those 1981 recommendations remained relevant for a long time. </p>
  
<p>The Marland model of information skills derived from his ground-breaking work in <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>schools in the 1980s. In 1980 a working group was set up jointly by the British Library Research and <span>Development</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>Department and the now-defunct Schools Council to produce <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>guidance to teachers on developing information skills. The working party's reports <em>Information skills in the <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>curriculum</em>, was sent to every <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>school in England and Wales (<a href="#rog94">Rogers, 1994</a>). The report stated: </p>
  
<blockquote>Individuals today have an increasing need to be able to find things out. Never before has our lives depended so much on our ability to handle information successfully. We need to be able to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>out what we <span>require</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> to assess critically the ideas and facts <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to us, and to make use of our <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> 'Learning to learn' which begins at <span>school</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> continues in our adult lives in our work, in our leisure activities, and in any further <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> And yet <span>schools</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> which are concerned with learning above all else, find great <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>pupils how to learn. Although some pupils are able to use the full <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of learning resources which the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>can offer, 
most are not, and it is a <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>responsibility of the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to help its pupils to cope with learning. (<a href="#mar81">Marland, 1981</a>). </blockquote>
  
<p>The Marland model tried to identify a number of questions which pupils could ask themselves when undertaking assignments in <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and outlined a <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>information skills curriculum in terms of nine questions: 1. What do I need to do? 2. Where could I go? 3. How do I get to the information? 4. Which resources shall I use? 5. How shall I use the resources? 6. What should I make a record of? 7. Have I got the information I need? 8. How should I present it? 9. What have I achieved? </p>
  
<p>These questions <span>accompanied</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>with <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>for teachers and <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>librarians which identified skills in relation to each question (<a href="#mar81">Marland, 1981: 24-25</a>).</p>
  
<p>According to Roger, by the end of the 1980s, it seemed that professionals concerned with information skills were <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>towards a greater understanding of <span>schools</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> needs. He defined several key developments revealed by the research in that <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in the UK including:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li> Differences between teachers and librarians were more widely acknowledged and work was being done to bridge the gap;</li>
  <li> The whole-school policies advocated in the 1981 Schools Council Report, <em>Information skills in the <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>curriculum</em>, were easy to frame but hard to put into effect, causing a reaction against policy formulation as a way forward;</li>
  <li> Promoting information skills was the librarian's most important task. As the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of research moved from information skills to learning, so librarians switched from library lessons to curriculum development;</li>
  <li> Information Technology was a spur to library use and a way of <span>extending</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>school</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>s own resources;</li>
  <li>It was hard to determine which changes in <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>had come about through information skills and library initiatives, and which through other educational developments. The research experience between 1983 and 1988 encouraged a holistic approach to developing information skills (<a href="#rog94">Rogers, 1994: ix-x</a>). </li>
</ul>

<p>Although the UK had a relatively <span>solid</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy in the 1980s, developments in the 1990s remained quite modest. However, the increase in project-based work in the National Curriculum led to more pupil-centred, resource-based learning in <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and changed <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to learning and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#tbb02">The Big Blue, 2002</a>). Some structures were developed for the delivery of information skills and ICTs in the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>curriculum. For example, Herring (<a href="#her96">1996</a>) proposed a 'PLUS' model that categorized 
information skills into four interrelated steps: Purpose, Location, Use and Self-Evaluation. Results of a study of the evaluation of the use of the PLUS model at Ripon Grammar School in England showed that pupils benefited from using a structured approach to project work and saw the model as a useful tool particularly in helping them to plan, organize, and <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on their own work (<a href="#her02">Herring, <em>et al.</em>, 2002</a>). Developments in the 1990s in the context of information skills in <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in the light of technological developments in the UK have been examined in more detail by Herring (<a href="#her96">1996</a>). </p>

<p>In the mid 1980s information literacy was also an articulated goal in Dutch <span>schools</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> In the early 1980s several publications, compiled as a result of research ordered by the Dutch government, highlighted the need for training information users in basic <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in connection with ICT awareness (<a href="#boe03">Boekhorst, 2003</a>). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>special Advisory Committee for Education and Information Technology (ACEIT) was created in 1981 and during 1984 the ACEIT proposed a <span>hybrid</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>new subject 'Information literacy and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>literacy' (ICL), defining it as <em>'...the knowledge and skills concerning the use of computers for getting information to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>a given problem or to know more about a certain subject, as well as for the control of processes.' </em>(<a href="#van91">Van Weering &amp; Plomp, 1991: 17</a>). In 1991, 20 of 29 <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>schools that participated in 
a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on ICL, indicated that some form of 'information literacy' was taught (<a href="#boe03">Boekhorst, 2003</a>). Information and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>literacy started to be the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of curriculum innovations (<a href="#har86">Hartsuijker, 1986</a>; <a href="#bun02">Bundy, 2002</a>) and the <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information 
skills has been recognised as a part of the <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>school curriculum <strong>in the Netherlands</strong> since 1993. In 1993 the <em>Stichting voor de Leerplanontwikkeling</em> (Foundation for Curriculum Development) published its recommended information skills for <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>school pupils. The recommendations included learning to define <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>questions and how to select and organise retrieved information. Librarians and teachers were seen as guides for <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>undertaking research (<a href="#bei96">Beishuizen, 1996</a>). However, the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>has been much more on <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>literacy than on information literacy in <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and a relatively small number of hours has been devoted to information literacy. Boekhorst also <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to the fact that the Dutch name for the subject <em>Informatiekunde</em> which means 'knowledge of information' has been <span>translated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>by the Dutch ministry in their <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>version publication as 'IT studies', which is a good illustration of its approach of the subject (<a href="#boe03">Boekhorst, 2003</a>).</p>

<p><strong>In Scandinavian countries</strong>, delivering training in aspects of information literacy has been more <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>institutions than in <span>schools</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> However, during the 1950s the Swedish <em>Bibliotekstj&auml;nst</em> (The Swedish Central Organization for Library Services Ltd.) began to produce 
a series of materials <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to teach basic library techniques primarily to <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>classes. For example, <em>Hitta i b&ouml;ckerna</em> (How to find out from books) in 1973 and <em>Hitta i biblioteket</em> (How to find out in the library) in 1976 were particularly popular. The aim of the series was, however, to enable the pupils to learn how to find the literature that they <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves. Similar types of materials were produced by the Danish Library Bureau. It should be said that <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>were taught 'library use' quite often as a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>small package bearing little relationship to their other <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>work. Earliest examples in Scandinavia of <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of the use of the library with other studies came from Norway. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>textbook</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><em>Skolbibliotek i bruk </em>(Use of the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>library) was published in 1978 by <em>'Statens Bibliotekstilsyn'</em> (the Norwegian Directorate for Public and School Libraries) with <span>explanations</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and examples of using <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>libraries in a <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>teaching programme (<a href="#fja84">Fj&auml;llbrant &amp; Malley, 1984: 202-203</a>). </p>
  
<p>Examples of <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>information literacy in <strong>Swedish</strong> <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in the <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>1980s demonstrate progress. For example, Kuhne presents the results of a three year study (1988-1991) of the extent to which the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of library and information skills was integrated into the curriculum of elementary <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in the city of Kalmar. The study, <em>Barkestorp project</em>, examined the way that teachers and librarians planned together; the way <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>acquired knowledge as a result of libraries being <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>into the curriculum; the impact of the library on the <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>process; and the role of the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>librarian. Teachers and librarians found that <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in a problem-oriented and resource-based way was difficult, but that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>so taught became more creative, positive, and independent in learning (<a href="#kuh95">Kuhne, 1995</a>). The M&ouml;nster&aring;s High School is another example where <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>are encouraged to <span>search</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> use and evaluate information in the problem-based learning process with high levels of ICT support within the national curriculum. The teacher no longer teaches the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>directly</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> but creates an <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>for successful learning, and acts as a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of inspiration and support. Key elements in the method include defining a problem, searching for information and evaluating it, reporting the result, and conclusions. Students choose their projects and engage in their own research, which extends to independent work <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>school</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> All teachers and <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>have been given their own portable Macintosh <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and all classrooms, group-rooms, the teachers' room and even certain activity rooms are connected. The project approach has encouraged cross-curricular work, for example history and language teachers working together. Parental enthusiasm is so strong that private <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>are <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to adopt the same approach (<a href="#oec01b">OECD, 2001b: 26-27</a>)</p>
  
<p>Successful examples of <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>information literacy in <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>can be found in several other countries. For example, the Bollate Provincial School Centre in <strong>Italy </strong>described a multi-year curriculum for <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>its <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>information skills and reported that the course objective was set so that when pupils <span>reached</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the fifth form they had <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>skills in studying, library use, media literacy, and the use of non-library information sources (<a href="#boc95">Boccardi &amp; Zappa, 1995</a>). </p>
  
<p><strong>In Spain</strong>, Francisco Javier Bernal has been a leader in developing information literacy in <span>schools</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> In 1985 he proposed a 'pedagogy of information' within the first National Program for Scientific and Technological Information and Documentation and in 1992 a transversal <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><em>educaci&oacute;n documental </em> in the curriculum for compulsory <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> As a result several special optional courses on information literacy were developed and several pilot projects in <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>included user <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> In some <span>regions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>coordination centres support <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>libraries in distributing materials and sharing experiences to foster information literacy. For example, the <em>Direcci&oacute;n Provincial in M&aacute;laga </em>provides specific materials to support information literacy in their Web-site for <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>good example is the <em>Fray Luis de Le&oacute;n High School </em>in Salamanca, where teachers across different disciplines use the library to support the learning processes of the <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> There are also several ICT literacy projects under development for <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>schools <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>where <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>library, digital library and learning resource portals are interlinked. However, a common problem for most ICT literacy programmes lies in the widespread <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that mastering ICT <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>is the same as mastering information access and use (<a href="#gom03">G&oacute;mez Hern&aacute;ndez &amp; Pasadas Ure&ntilde;a, 2003</a>). </p>
  
<p><strong>In Slovenia</strong>, Steinbuch (<a href="#ste99">1999</a>) described an <span>experimental</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>library and information skills programme integrated into the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>process at the gymnasium (grammar school) in Maribor. Tests showed that such a programme has a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>effect on the independence of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and their problem <span>solving</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> but <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in knowledge of participants in the <span>experiment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>was not significantly greater than that of a control group.

<h3>Information literacy in higher education</h3>

<p>Academic libraries have played an important role in information literacy developments  in Europe. Information literacy initiatives in higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>have taken a  variety of forms: stand-alone courses or <span>classes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> Web-based tutorials, course-related  instruction, or course-integrated instruction. Most authors seem to <span>agree</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that  information literacy should be integrated into subject areas (<a href="#kem99">Kemp,  1999</a>; <a href="#joi00">Joint &amp; Kemp, 2000</a>; <a href="#raf02">Rafste,  2002</a>; <a href="#tow02b">Town, 2002b</a>). Webber &amp; Johnston (<a href="#Web00">2000</a>)  differ from many other authors by advocating that information literacy can be  treated as a <span>discipline</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of study in its own right, rather than favouring the  curriculum <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>model. There is also a shift towards increasing <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> on faculty-librarian partnership and implementation of <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>ICTs in delivering  information literacy courses. There is a <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>experimentation with using  ICTs in European higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>institutions in general, sometimes to improve  the on-campus learning experience, at other times to deliver distance learning.  The general picture is that in most cases institutions are now transferring  from a <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of rich and mostly bottom-up experimentation to a phase in which  institution-wide use of ICT is being encouraged (<a href="#col02">Collis &amp;  <span>Van</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>der Wende, 2002</a>). While the new ICTs are having a variety of <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> effects on <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning in <span>universities</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> there are also a number of  other important factors having <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>influences on higher <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> The processes  in implementing the Bologna Declaration are having an impact on the development  of curriculum structures and <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>control <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and procedures. The <span>rise</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> in lifelong learning and widening of access to higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>bring in new  learners with different previous educational experiences. </p> 
  
<p>The educational policy of the European Union (EU) has three <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>objectives, which concern: </p>
  
<ul>
  <li>increasing the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and effectiveness of <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and training; </li>
  <li>facilitating access of all to <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and training;</li>
  <li> opening <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and training to the wider world (<a href="#coi02">COIMBRA Group of Universities, 2002: 5</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>In this context, there is also evidence of efforts to develop new <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> and learning methods that emphasise and support <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to learn constructively,   and to construct their knowledge using information wisely. Several information  literacy experiments and examples of good practice should be highlighted in European countries. </p>
  
<p><strong>In the UK</strong> context, the conference on Information Technology and Information Literacy in Glasgow, March 20-22, 2002 demonstrated several  examples of good practice. For example, the British Open University, Edge Hill  College of Higher Education, Cardiff University, Cranfield University, University College Northampton and the University of Sheffield have developed interesting information literacy programmes. Many programmes are based on the SCONUL model.  (<a href="#sco99">SCONUL, 1999</a>). </p>    

<p>Examples of good practice identified by 'The Big Blue' project    included, for example, Southport College, where an internally accredited information  skills module is compulsory for all first year <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> South Bank University which demonstrates <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>applications of learning outcomes and the impact they have on information skills training, and the University of Aberdeen where pre- and post- self-assessment has been carried out to encourage <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to track their progress and see the value of attending information skills training. South    Bank University Library has also developed a benchmarking scheme for undergraduate <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> Numerous other initiatives are also <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>place and there are traditional  and online courses and tutorials on information literacy at many universities:  the Robert Gordon University, the University of Bristol, the London School of Economics, the University of Nottingham, the University of Bradford, Aston University,  Coventry University, etc. (<a href="#tbb02">The Big Blue, 2002</a>). </p>    

<p>A trend that has also gained popularity in the UK is an interactive Web-based information literacy tutorial, which is <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to introduce <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to information literacy concepts and information resources. However, the University of Leeds briefly experimented with computer-assisted library instruction as early as the end of the 1970s (<a href="#fja84">Fj&auml;llbrant &amp; Malley, 1984</a>).  </p> 

<p>At the British Open University (OU) <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>work has been done to explore the use of technology for delivering information literacy in distance learning  programmes and several models have been tested. For example, Safari is the OU  Library's information skills tutorial, an interactive, Web-based <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> package for <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> tutors, and staff, launched in January 2001. Safari can  be used by in a variety of ways - as a training package, working through each  of the <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in order, or by dipping in to specific topics of interest.  Mosaic is another twelve-week online course, <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>by the Library in conjunction  with the Faculty of Education and <span>Language</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>Studies, which attracts 10 credit  points. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>team of study advisors provide support via the phone, email and learning  management system (FirstClass). Students have the opportunity to work through  a <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>package to develop information skills, which will be assessed via  coursework or the production of a literature review. The SCONUL Task <span>Force</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on  Information Skills (now SCONUL Advisory Committee on Information Literacy (<a href="#alv03">Alvestrand,  2003</a>)) has acted as critical reader for the course. Introducing Teaching  and Learning Online (ITLO) from the OU's Institute of Educational Technology  is a programme <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to support OU staff in the development of online <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> and learning. The Website consists of a series of online interactive activities  aimed at helping course teams to make decisions about aspects of online <span>teaching</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>  The information literacy section, to which the unit contributes, provides background  information about information literacy, and deals with key questions about information  literacy to help teams decide what aspects should be included in their course.  The OU approach may be described as <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>with the UK key skills initiatives  and it is <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>as a complement for study programmes or as a stand-alone  course (<a href="#dil02">Dillon, et al., 2002</a>; <a href="#oul03">OU, 2003</a>). </p> 

<p>Hepworth (<a href="#hep00b">2000b</a>) also confirms that Web-based guides such as guides to literature searching are increasingly common. Stubbings &amp; Brine (<a href="#stu03">2003</a>) analysed forty-seven electronic information literacy packages in the UK and <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>these into three types: virtual tours (four); OPAC tutorials (nine) and information skills tutorials (twenty-eight). There were two packages being used by more than one institution and <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>tutorials required passwords and as such could not be accessed. Of the 21 information literacy tutorials reviewed, four were subject specific with the remaining being generic in nature. The content as well as instructional <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>principles varied to a great extent and didn't refer always to sound pedagogy. <span>Sometimes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>tutorials were also too text-based, lacking <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>interactivity to create adequate active learning experiences. However, Rutter &amp; Matthews (<a href="#rut02">2002</a>), reporting their experiences in developing 'InfoSkills', Bournemouth University's Web-based library tutorial, refer to the sound pedagogic and generic basis of InfoSkills that has enabled it to be seen by others <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the university as something that could be adapted for their own usage. They also highlight the self-learning principle of the tutorial allowing continuing reinforcement when required for specific user groups, such as international or <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>registration <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>
  
<p>Specific cases receiving <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>within the higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>sector also include: a subject specific guide that has been produced by Leicester University Library to develop information retrieval skills for medicine, the activities of the London Business School where librarians are providing support for the broad <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information literacy learning and the University of Sunderland which has secured European funding to help develop a 'virtual librarian' that will facilitate the learning of information skills. Leicester University has also provided excellent material for distance learners to help with using information resources. <em>Liberation </em>at Northampton University provides training on searching the Web and searching in general but allows the user to enter <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>topics that are relevant to them and then provides appropriate feedback (<a href="#hep00b">Hepworth, 2000b: 26-27</a>). In the UK information literacy courses tend to be optional, although an example of a formal credit-based course can be found at Strathclyde University. However, Hepworth (<a href="#hep00c">2000c: 30</a>) notes that, to catch up with the institutionalised initiatives that have taken place elsewhere in the world, significant additional funding that is specifically aimed at fostering the development of information literate <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in the higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>sector is required.</p> 

  
<p>Several <strong>Scottish</strong> <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>have also developed <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>information literacy programmes (<a href="#rad02a">Rader, 2002a</a>). In 1993 the project 'Teaching with Independent Learning Technologies' (TILT) started at Glasgow University. The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>aim was to demonstrate how IT could be successfully incorporated into university <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>within a single institution. Four years later, TILT demonstrated its value in many areas, particularly in library and study skills. More than 130 institutions both in the UK and elsewhere started to use the five hypertext information skills modules as a resource in their undergraduate <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> and <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>evaluations of their effectiveness have been carried out (<a href="#cre96">Creanor, <em>et al.</em>, 1996</a>). The GAELS project at the Universities of Strathclyde and Glasgow aimed at improving access to, and use of resources, particularly for post-graduate architecture and engineering <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> Part of the project developed an online information skills course based around a core module which covered searching techniques, whilst other modules covered topics such as the use of databases and the Internet for information retrieval. The GAELS Project also produced many other packages for information skills training in subjects other than the original Engineering courseware. The course could be used both as a stand-alone resource for individual <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>or as part of workshops led by librarians. The learning materials <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that learners undertake <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>exercises using a number of external online resources. However, the course does not teach basic library skills, and <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>need to have some experience in using academic libraries (<a href="#kem99">Kemp, 1999</a>; <a href="#joi00">Joint &amp; Kemp, 2000</a>). It should also be noted that the Scottish Executive's <em>Digital Scotland </em>consultation paper states that Web navigation and information extraction skills are vital for young people (<a href="#joh00">Johnston, 2000</a>).</p> 
  
<p>Rader (<a href="#rad02a">2002a</a>) also <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to some information literacy activities at several academic institutions in <strong>Ireland</strong>. However, in-depth interviews with lecturers from social science faculties in five Irish <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>indicated that information literacy holds a relatively insignificant place in academia. </p>
  
<p>In the Nordic countries <strong>Sweden </strong>seems to be at the forefront of information literacy developments. During the past two decades, <span>Chalmers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>University of Technology has developed comprehensive information literacy programmes. For example, Fj&auml;llbrant and her colleagues were targeting information literacy goals as they are <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>today already in 1980s. Their subjects, <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to introduce postgraduate <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and researchers to electronic and other information networks, continue to be regarded as a model (<a href="#fja88">Fj&auml;llbrant, 1988</a>; <a href="#bru00">Bruce &amp; Candy, 2000</a>; <a href="#bun02">Bundy, 2002</a>). They have utilized IT to provide more efficient instruction to <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>
<span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> thus freeing librarians to develop <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>electronic information skills instruction for upper-level and graduate <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#fja00a">Fj&auml;llbrant, 2000a</a>). Many other university libraries deliver information literacy courses. For example, at the Link&ouml;ping University librarians and faculty have been 
experimenting for more than ten years with <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>students appropriate information skills (<a href="#rad02a">Rader, 2002a</a>), at the Karolinska Institute information literacy is linked with problem-based learning and at Malm&ouml; University staff are working on integrating information literacy into the curriculum (<a href="#hep00c">Hepworth, 2000c: 26</a>).</p>
  
<p>Tovot&eacute; notes that the changes in learning and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>during the 1990s have led to increased demands for broader and more varied sources of information at all levels of <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in Sweden. Students are doing independent information searches in connection with their class assignments and the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of study aids has become more varied as well as the use of libraries for the purpose of <span>teaching</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> The old system of handing out lists of required <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>for each course is being replaced by a method where the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>take responsibility for their own learning. She also describes a special project at Malm&ouml; University attracting <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>from non-academic <span>backgrounds</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>out if there was a need for a special pedagogical approach to their courses in information searching. This project was a great success, partly because of relationship marketing. There is now a programme aimed at the information literate student and conducted on different levels, from a pre-degree level to a doctoral level. The Higher Education Administration, who recently gave Malm&ouml; University the right to award Bachelor Degrees, mentions especially the ambitious IT support and the courses in searching, evaluating and handling information integrated into the subject areas, as an important <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>factor when awarding this right. Tovot&eacute; also <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to a new distance <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>course called Communication for <span>Development</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>within the area of Arts and Communication where <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>can deepen the insight into their <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>between social development and information, communication and media, through both theoretical studies and through a specific project assignment in a developing country where the library has an important role (<a href="#tov01">Tovot&eacute;, 2001: 5-7</a>).</p>
  
<p>Teaching information literacy is a rapidly <span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>activity also in <strong>Danish </strong>libraries. The Danish Electronic Research Library (DEF) initiative has <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>greatly information literacy developments in higher <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> For example, together with the Faculty of Modern Languages, the Library at the &Aring;rhus School of Business (LASB) is a partner in an innovative IT-project financed by the Danish Ministry of Education: <em>IT-reorganization project - Faculty of the Future!</em> (2001-2004). In this project LASB is acting as a learning and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>support unit for IT-based <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and dissemination of information as well as being the content provider concerning electronic course packages. Since 1998 LASB has cooperated closely with the faculty at the &Aring;rhus School of Business on the <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of electronic library facilities into an e-Learning <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> As a result several flexible Web-based course packages have been developed in which the LASB has provided electronic library resources, cleared copyright materials, taught information skills and created IT <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and platforms for the electronic course packages. Another project, METRO, a virtual learning resource centre using a metro <span>map</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>as a metaphor to guide <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to valuable information and learning resources, was developed at the &Aring;rhus School of Business as a joint venture between the Library and Faculty (<a href="#harb02">Harbo, 2002</a>; <a href="#met03">METRO, 2003</a>).</p>
  
<p>Several other examples of good practice should be noted. For example, at the Aalborg University Library a project titled MILE (Model for Information Literacy Education) was initiated, aiming to create and <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>a model for user instruction in information literacy, based on innovative pedagogy and ICT. The product consists of a <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of multimedia or Web-based just-in-time tutorials, as well as live instruction integrated in the teaching/learning process (<a href="#mil03">MILE, 2003</a>). At the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University, Denmark's Pharmaceutical University, the University of Southern Denmark, and the Technical University of Denmark, courses in information searching are part and parcel of credit-earning, compulsory subject courses. Examples of successful information literacy initiatives also include: the SWIM (Streaming Web-based Information Modules) project developed by the Aalborg University Library which use streaming-server technology where the tutorial enables the student to make a number of choices about <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy and problem solving; the <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information literacy into the curriculum at the Holstebro School of Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy (<a href="#sko03">Skov &amp; Sk&#509;rbak, 2003</a>; <a href="#swi03">SWIM, 2003</a>); Roskilde University Library's Godin project on problem-based <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information searching (<a href="#tru00">Trumpy, 2000</a>); and several Web-based tutorials such as <em>Introduktion til informationss&oslash;gning</em> (<a href="#dtv03">Danmarks Tekniske Videncenter, 2003</a>;and <em>InfoTutor</em> <a href="#inf03">InfoTutor, 2003</a>).</p>
  
<p><strong>In Norway </strong>information literacy developments can be linked with medical and <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>with the increasing <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>being on problem-based learning. For example, the University of Trondheim and the University of Oslo are good examples (<a href="#tay00">Taylor &amp; Krog, 2000</a>; <a href="#har02">Haraldstad, 2002</a>; <a href="#ras00">Rasch &amp; Trondsen, 2000</a>). Bjorndal, <em>et al.</em>, (<a href="#bjo99">1999</a>) also refer to a cooperation project between the University Library of Oslo University medical faculty, and the State Institute for Public Health, which involves the training of medical <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in the use of electronic <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and critical evaluation of information. Hepworth (<a href="#hep00c">2000c: 26</a>) notes that where problem-based learning takes place there is evidence to <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that this encourages information literacy, or rather that information literacy is the key to problem-based learning.</p>
  
<p>Audunson &amp; Nordlie confirm that the institutions of higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and their libraries have been in the forefront of information literacy development in Norway. There has been also a <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>trend towards a change from the traditional University or College library to a 'learning centre' or 'learning resource centre' and the transition from 'user <span>education</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> to 'information competence development'. They wrote:</p> 

<blockquote>Information literacy - defined as information competence or knowledge - now seems to be a firmly <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>concept and educational goal in the whole <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of Norwegian educational institutions.

<p>There are also several projects that connect research and practice. For example, at the University of Bergen a DIA-project examines information literacy in a broader context. The <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of this co-operation project, between the teacher training programmes for the sciences at the <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of Oslo and Bergen, was in <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>students to think more broadly about information gathering and processing, about <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and about evaluation of Internet resources.

<p>Homann has given an <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>overview about the development of user <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and information literacy in academic libraries in <strong>Germany</strong>. He highlights the orientation towards new pedagogic concepts and influence of the Anglo-American models of information literacy at the end of 1990s. Both the University of Heidelberg and the University of Hamburg have been experimenting with information literacy courses and online tutorials for several years. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>modular <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>approach was developed at the University Library of Heidelberg and a 'Dynamic Model of Information Literacy' (<em>Dynamisches Modell der Informationskompetenz/DYMIK</em>) based on the Anglo-American models of information literacy was adapted to their library requirements. The library is con0ering <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in the new e-learning activities of the University and <span>extension</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information literacy courses. The project-oriented approach, including the use of individual thematic problems as starting points and integrating information literacy and learning was developed in the last few years at the Department of Library and Information at the Hamburg University of Applied Sciences. The teacher took a role of assisting on demand and an online tutorial <em>'Der schlaue Det'</em> was developed to offer the users additional support for self-testing and communication with the librarian (<a href="#hom01">Homann, 2001</a>; <a href="#hom03">2003</a>). Modularised courses and activating <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>methods are now used in many university libraries in <span>Germany</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> However, according to Homann (<a href="#hom01">2001</a>) most librarians are not qualified to take on <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>tasks. Therefore, courses on planning and realizing user <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>have been <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and regional meetings organized to share experiences. He also notes: 'Although there are a lot of activities, these are not the result of a systematic development but primarily the result of a lot of individual initiatives and it is not enough for a sustainable development'.</p>
  
<p>Several information literacy initiatives in higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>can be <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on the basis of literature <strong>in the Netherlands</strong>. To support the current trends towards self-learning the University of Twente has developed the <em>Methodisch en Efficient Wetenschappelijke Informatie Zoeken</em> (MEEWIZ) (Methodical and Efficient Searching for Scientific Information) system. Through a series of six modules <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>are taught how to plan <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and to manage information. Users are directed to the different sources of information including patents, official <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and statistics. Use of interactive <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>ensures that <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> progress is monitored and guidance <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>where appropriate. Reactions to the system are reported as being positive (<a href="#bra00">Braaksma, 2000</a>). The development of <em>DelftSpecial</em> (Student Personal Educational Coach for Information Alerting and Learning) started in 2001 in the University Library at Delft in collaboration with Utrecht University. DelftSpecial is a ICT-supported instruction programme in which <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>can learn how to use information both <span>independently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>as well as embedded in an educational context. It enables <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to learn how to formulate the query, to find information, to evaluate it and to determine the value of the information they find in connection with the relevant research <span>domain</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> At the same time the programme <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>several <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>for storing and sharing information as well as for collaboration (<a href="#boe03">Boekhorst, 2003</a>). Hepworth (<a href="#hep00b">2000b: 31</a>) also <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to the University of Maastricht 'study landscapes' created to facilitate problem-based learning and the incorporation of information literacy. These study landscapes included providing a place where <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>feel at home, where they can find the necessary learning resources, where they can study <span>independently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>or in groups and where the learning resources in the study area are assembled with the specific group in mind. These resources were in addition to and <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>from those found in the core <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> Information literacy activities of the library of Rotterdam's Erasmus University have also received <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and are <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to in the literature (<a href="#dre02">Drenthe &amp; van Elk, 2002</a>).</p>
  
<p>The Faculty of Humanities at the University of Amsterdam also started in 1997 a compulsory module 'Information Literacy' for first year <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> The module <span>consisted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of: <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>skills, library skills, <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and oral presentations. These were undertaken on the basis of a <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>research problem derived from the student's subject and <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>had to formulate an answer, which led to a verbal <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and a written report on the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>procedure. Teaching was done in faculty-library partnership. In 2002 the module was renamed 'Academic 
Skills' and the module was split in two parts: Research and Argumentation (<a href="#boe03">Boekhorst, 2003</a>). </p>
  
<p><strong>In Spain</strong> several <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>offer optional credit courses within the curriculum for most degrees, <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>configuration credit courses for specialized documentation skills, and specific tutor support for final year <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>preparing their final dissertation. Examples of free-choice credit courses include those <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>by the <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of Barcelona, Granada and the Polytechnic of Catalonia. Web pages of many academic libraries include tutorials and user guides to support information literacy, for example, at the <em>Univer0ad Carlos III in Madrid, Polytechnic University of Catalonia </em>and the <em>Open University of Catalonia</em>. More and more higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>institutions include specific user <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and information skills courses within the curriculum for specific disciplines and degrees. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>good example is the course 'Information Skills and Strategies' at the Univer0ad de Murcia (<a href="#gom03">G&oacute;mez Hern&aacute;ndez &amp; Pasadas Ure&ntilde;a, 2003</a>). </p>

<p>According to Feo (<a href="#feo98">1998</a>) many information literacy initiatives took place from the early 1980s in several <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><strong>in France</strong>, encouraged by the ministry responsible for scientific and technical information. For example, in 1986 at the <em>University of Paris 8 (Universite Vincennes-Saint-Denis Paris 8)</em> an information methodology course was <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>which is now required in several university departments and over 1000 <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>take this course every year. Coulon (<a href="#cou99">1999</a>) also evaluates positively the impact of the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information literacy courses at the same university. The <em>Service commun de la documentation </em>(SCD), the joint information service, at the University of Paris 4 (<em>Universit&eacute; Paris Sorbonne- Paris IV</em>) participates in the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information skills for <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>year undergraduates and postgraduates. The role of the SCD can take different forms and the duration and content of courses vary from one faculty to another. However, two conditions are systematically met: the <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information component in disciplinary or methodological university <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> and its adaptation to the specifics of each <span>discipline</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> The objective is to educate <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in the research and exploitation of information, so that they can profit from such courses in the preparation of their Master's thesis or higher diplomas (<a href="#fay99">Fayet, 1999</a>). However, Alava (<a href="#ala99">1999</a>) notes that despite research into the problem of student <span>failure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in French <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and official policies to foster information literacy, there has been little positive <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to ensure academic success and social <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>into the university.</p>

<p>Nieuwenhuysen (<a href="#nie00">2000</a>) also reports information literacy initiatives <strong>in Belgian</strong> <span>universities</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> He describes courses that are <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and at the Universitaire Instelling Antwerpen (UIA) which is part of the University of Antwerp (UA). The levels of the courses described are at the university <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>study year and Masters level. The need for a collaborative approach in offering online information literacy courses is emphasised. </p>

<p>Sada <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>also information literacy activities of the library of the Catholic University, Milan <strong>in Italy</strong>. She notes, however, that <em>'Italian university <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>do not really know what a library is, or what it can do for them.'</em> (<a href="#sad99">Sada, 1999: 23</a>). It is also interesting to note that she uses the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>'meta-competencies' described earlier, referring to information-related competencies. </p>

<p>It should be also noted that in the former Eastern bloc countries, there are several programmes to teach <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>aspects of information literacy. Borovansky from the Arizona State University worked at the <strong>Czech</strong> Technical University in Prague in 2000 and assisted in the <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of engineers in using information resources. He reports serious efforts led by the few dedicated professional librarians to further improve the <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of engineers and to increase their information literacy. At the Institute of Chemical Technology in Prague on the first level, most faculties (colleges) offer introductory courses for <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> On the second, <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>level, the library <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>specialised information courses. At the Technical University Brno the university administration has approved the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of a mandatory four hour information literacy course for all first year <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> Two hours are devoted to introductory computing, while the other two hours are spent dealing with the use of computers in library/information <span>applications</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> The staff of the <span>Computing</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>Centre teach the first part, librarians of the Central Library the second part. The proportion of the theoretical part to the <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>one is two to one (<a href="#bor00">Borovansky, 2000</a>). Pejova from Slovenia in her paper for the UNESCO Expert Meeting also <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to well-organized information literacy <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><strong>in Estonia</strong>: <em>'One example of <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and well-pursued information literacy programs is Estonia, where there is strong information and library professional <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>'</em> (<a href="#pej02">Pejova, 2002: 5</a>).</p>

<h3>Standards</h3>

<p>It should also be noted that the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education approved by the ACRL are being <span>translated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and used in several countries: in Finland, <span>Germany</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and Spain (<a href="#sin03">Sinikara &amp; J&auml;rvel&auml;inen, 2003</a>; <a href="#hom03">Homann, 2003</a>; <a href="#gom03">G&oacute;mez Hern&aacute;ndez &amp; Pasadas Ure&ntilde;a, 2003</a>). However, the Finnish authors note that although the ACRL standards are the basis for the developmental work done in Finland they have also been criticized as not being well suited to the Finnish university <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>system. Because of this there has also been interest in the UK SCONUL model, which some think illustrates more clearly the process of developing information skills (<a href="#sin03">Sinikara &amp; J&auml;rvel&auml;inen, 2003</a>). Homann (<a href="#hom03">2003</a>) also notes that comprehensive concepts of information literacy according to the ACRL standards have been deemed too ambitious and not realizable in German libraries. This was the dominant tendency in <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on the ACRL standards in a workshop at the German library congress 2001 in Augsburg and in different workgroups after their translation by Homann. It seems that information literacy competency standards tend to be broad <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of an ideal, rather than <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>formulations for <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>need. Therefore, there is a <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>interest in the UK SCONUL model in several countries. </p>

<h2> Organizations and institutions concerned with information literacy in Europe</h2>

<h3> European Union</h3>

<p>In the context of a knowledge-based society several studies have <span>emphasized</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the role of knowledge and the importance of using information. It seems that educational, <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and political leaders alike have acknowledged that success in the new century will <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on being skilled at <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and using information. However, Muir &amp; Oppenheim state: <em>'while the EC is very active in Information Society initiatives, most of its efforts seem to be focused on getting the technological infrastructure in place and supporting the development of ICT skills, rather than information literacy'</em> (<a href="#mui01">Muir &amp; Oppenheim, 2001: 175</a>). Ryyn&auml;nen (<a href="#ryy02">2002</a>) gives a rather more positive view, noting that the European Union (EU) has taken various initiatives in the information literacy area, though the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of coherent and long-term policy is clear. For example, libraries have been included in the EU's Framework Programmes for Research and <span>Development</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>since the 1990s. This has led to an unprecedented <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of networking among European libraries. In 1998 the European Parliament approved its first report on the role of libraries in <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>societies. This report has received <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and led to <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>particularly in the member states. Its role in0e the EU, especially in the European Commission, has been smaller, due to the political changes in the Commission soon after the adoption of this document. Ryyn&auml;nen who was the rapporteur of this text, notes that it emphasises among other things information literacy, putting it into the context of traditional literacy (<a href="#ryy02">Ryyn&auml;nen, 2002</a>). </p>
  
<p>The spring meeting of the European Council of Information Associations <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on 25-26th March 2001 in Madrid with representatives from Finland, Sweden, <span>Germany</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> Spain, Portugal, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Belgium also highlighted information literacy as a must in the information society, and it could also be seen as the first step to promote the profession. As it was acknowledged that there was no EU project on the subject, Carla Basili from Italy expressed willingness to coordinate a work group that would define the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and monitor initiatives taken in different countries (<a href="#eci01">ECIA, 2001</a>). She has initiated a project 'EnIL: European thematic <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on information literacy' (<a href="#bas03">Basili, 2003</a>), the idea being to form a European <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information literacy experts, and a state of the <span>art</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>book is meant to form the basis of a discussion in the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(A.

<p>However, several projects in information literacy have been initiated at European level and funded by the EC. Among the best known are the <em>End User Courses in Information Access through Communication Technology (EDUCATE) </em>and <em>Distance Education Information Courses with Access Through Networks (DEDICATE) </em>projects. <em>EDUCATE</em> (1994-1997) was developed under the EU Telematics for Libraries Third Framework project and was concerned with subject-related aspects of information literacy for scientists and engineers, and aimed to develop an online course in the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and use of information <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>which could be used in a number of settings, for self-directed learning or as part of a formal course in information literacy. <em>EDUCATE</em> led to two 'Into Info' subject modules: physics and electrical &amp; electronic engineering, which were tested for the training of undergraduate <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and researchers at ten <span>universities</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> The programmes were produced in <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>subject areas: architecture, <span>chemistry</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>energy</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> electrical and electronic engineering, environmental information sources, medicine and physics and the production of modules in other subjects followed: the history of science and technology, and civil engineering. The programmes, which were produced in <span>English</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> French and Spanish, can be used by librarians and information specialists in courses on information literacy. The project involved several European <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>from Ireland, Sweden, France, Spain and the UK. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>example of the use of the 'Into Info' programmes in distance learning was <em>Infovision </em>- a project funded by the <em>Swedish Distance Education Commission</em>. <em>Infovision </em>provided a distance learning course on the use of information sources in <span>energy</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and/or physics which involved the <span>Physics</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>Department at Gothenburg University, <span>Chalmers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>University of Technology, the University of Karlstad and the Gotland College of Higher Education (<a href="#fja00a">Fj&auml;llbrant, 2000a: 32</a>). </p>
  
<p>The <em>DEDICATE</em> project <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the feasibility of delivering programmes about aspects of information literacy via distance learning. The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>aim of this project was to develop cost-effective distance learning courses in information literacy for librarians and academic staff. These courses were piloted at five sites in Central and Eastern Europe. <em>DEDICATE</em> was based on the <em>EDUCATE</em> project and the UK Electronic Libraries Programme-funded NetLinkS project. These Web-based information literacy packages for engineering and the sciences are in use across Europe and Australia. According to Fj&auml;llbrant the <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>learning outcomes from the DEDICATE courses were impressive. The DEDICATE project has had an immediate and important effect on university courses in the five Central and Eastern European countries where DEDICATE test-sites were established: in Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland (<a href="#fja00a">Fj&auml;llbrant, 2000a</a>; <a href="#fja00b">2000b</a>; <a href="#bru00">Bruce &amp; Candy, 2000</a>). Through this well-known project information literacy ideas have spread in many European countries.</p>
  
<p>Another EU funded project, VERITY (<em>Virtual and Electronic Resources for Information Skills Training for Young People</em>), brought together a European consortium under the leadership of Information Services at the University of Sunderland, UK and was aimed at assisting young people in the 13-19 age <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to develop their information seeking skills in the Internet. The project was completed in December 2000 (<a href="#pap00">Papazoglou, 2000</a>, <a href="#tbb02">Big Blue, 2002</a>). CHILIAS (<em>Children's Library - Informational - Animation - Skills</em>), developed by a European consortium of innovative public libraries in <span>Germany</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> the UK, Finland, Greece, Spain and Portugal under the leadership of Stuttgart City Library, <span>Germany</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> created a virtual library for <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>aged between 9 and 12. It enables <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to access information in the six <span>languages</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of the partner countries, to communicate with the participating libraries and with other <span>children</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> and to take part in exercises that will help them to develop their information skills (<a href="#bus00">Bussmann &amp; Stafford, 2000</a>). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>collaborative project LOCOMOTIVE (<em>Local Community - Openness, Transparency, Information - a European Perspective</em>) between Norway, Sweden and Hungary, directed its interest towards public libraries in local communities. It aimed at identifying and analysing, on a cross-European basis information related barriers to participation in European metropolitan cities and also emphasised information literacy in this context. The Faculty of Journalism, Library and Information Science of Oslo University College was initiator of the project (<a href="#aud01">Audunson, et al, 2001</a>).</p>
  
<p>The <em>DELCIS: Distance Education for Librarians: Creating an Information-Competent Society'</em> project (2000-2002) was financed by the EC Leonardo da Vinci Programme. The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>objective of the project was to create a distance <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>programme in ICT competencies for library and information professionals in Lithuania and Latvia. The project initiative was based on the idea that public libraries are in a good position to promote of information literacy at a local level because of the existing <span>network</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> professionalism in organizing and providing information and their reputation as <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>centres for information, <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and culture, addressing the broadest variety of user groups. To be able to act as providers of information literacy for the <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> librarians first have to acquire competencies themselves and to have an opportunity to upgrade their skills constantly. Courses were adapted from the Danish analogue provided by &Aring;rhus County Library. The project had an <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>partnership of 10 institutions: 4 <span>universities</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> 3 public libraries, 2 private enterprises and 1 university-enterprise training partnership. The <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of partners covered a wide geographic area - Baltic countries, Scandinavia, Central Europe, Western Europe and the Mediterranean <span>region</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#vir02">Virkus, 2002</a>).</p>
  
<h3> Institutions and organizations at regional and national level</h3>

<p>Several institutions and organizations are concerned with information literacy in Europe. For example, the importance of library and information literacy services for open and distance learning at <strong>European level </strong>led the European Association of Distance Teaching Universities (EADTU) to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in June 1998 the Library and Learning Support Working Group (LLSWG). The LLSWG connects library and information professionals and educators from the EADTU member institutions (256 dual-mode <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and six open <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in Europe) and is committed to the development of library and learning support and information literacy services as an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>element in innovative and cost-effective <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to learning. It aims to address strategic issues as well as to seek to identify, disseminate and encourage good practice in supporting both on-campus and distance learners (<a href="#ead02">EADTU, 2002</a>). LLSWG now regularly <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>sessions on information literacy at EADTU annual conferences as well as other international conferences. The strategic aim of the LLSWG has been to share information literacy ideas more widely in educational <span>circles</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>than among librarians.</p>

<p>At regional level, a brainstorming group with participants from all the <strong>Nordic countries</strong> was invited by NORDINFO (The Nordic Council of Scientific Information) to <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>ideas for Nordic initiatives within the area of information literacy. The group named themselves the NORDINFOLit Group, under the auspices of NORDINFO. The first meeting of NORDINFOLit highlighted as one of the most important goals that initiatives on the development of <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> and pupils' competencies should be promoted in a partnership between teachers and librarians. The group has also planned the development of a Nordic edition of American and Australian standards (<a href="#bje01">Bjerg, 2001</a>). Several projects have been discussed to seek funds from NORDINFO. Plans are also in process to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>a Nordic Institute for Information Literacy. Four <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of activities have been started by NORDINFOLit: there are already summer <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on information literacy for Nordic librarians, seminars about standards and 'best practice' and a Nordic information literacy portal has been initiated as well. Maria Schr&ouml;der, representative of the NORDINFOLit, notes that it is quite difficult to find national or Nordic development programmes including information literacy in Nordic countries, but new <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>strategies include ways of learning that support the development of information literacy. She also stresses the need to exchange experience, professional knowledge and skills, common standards, and cooperation in developing infrastructure and content. NORDINFO has also prepared a three-year strategy for the institution where one of the focal points is information literacy. This means that grants and financial support are being given to a variety of activities in this area within the Nordic countries during the three years 2000-2003 (<a href="#sch02">Schr&ouml;der, 2002</a>). </p>
  
<p>In several countries, professional institutions and organizations have included information literacy in their agendas. For example, <strong>in Denmark</strong> a number of special interest groups <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on information literacy. The Danish Union of Librarians has two interest groups committed to information literacy: 'Libraries and <span>education</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> involves members from the upper <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>school libraries, the libraries of vocational educational institutions and the centres for higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>for adult learners. The second group focuses on the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>role of the librarian in particular, attracting members with <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>responsibilities from all library sectors. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>group, aimed towards academic and university libraries, is the 'Special interest group on user <span>education</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> under the Danish Research Library Association. The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>activities of these three interest groups are to arrange conferences and seminars, and to share experiences via professional journals. These groups <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>home pages with news, electronic conferences, and a <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to information, <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and activities on information literacy (<a href="#sko03">Skov &amp; Sk&#509;rbak, 2003</a>).</p>
  
<p><strong>In the UK </strong>the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) has also included information literacy in its agenda. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>brainstorming session was arranged in 2001 to define what the <span>constituents</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information literacy are. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>number of possible facets were defined. These can be summarised as:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li> Personal/Motivational: what makes a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>want to learn? How can we help them recognise the need and value of information to their lives?</li>
  <li> Practical skills: the competences required to perform individual functions in the information process (e.g. understanding Dewey; using a computer; looking up an item in a <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>book; using key words as <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>method etc);</li>
  <li> <span>Critical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>skills: those overarching skills needed to put together an effective information <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy or to evaluate the results of such a search;</li>
<li> Environmental factors: external factors that may inhibit or enhance information literacy (e.g., availability of library resources, charging) (<a href="#pag01">PAG, 2001</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>In looking at the key issues that needed to be tackled, the Brainstorming Group identified learning, motivation, partnerships and networks. The Report of the Policy Advisory Group on a National Information Policy of CILIP was published and also presented conclusions about the state of information literacy in the UK. According to this report, there is no clear and agreed definition of what is meant by 'information literacy' or 'information skills' at the moment. The criteria for information literacy vary and a goal for people to become information literate to increase their effectiveness is often masked by information technology literacy targets. There is little evidence of government initiatives and too heavy an <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on technology infrastructure and basic information technology skills. The report highlights a need for an agreed definition of the <span>term</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> and to <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>it from 'information skills'. It is also stated that the UK should develop a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>information literacy programme, using colleges, public libraries and other appropriate centres of excellence to promote a critical, informed use of the information resources that are now so readily available (<a href="#pag01">PAG, 2001</a>). </p>

<p>In the higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>sector, the UK Standing Conference of National and University Libraries (SCONUL) has been leading the campaign for information literacy since 1999 (<a href="#joh00">Johnson, 2000</a>). </p>

<p><strong>In the Netherlands</strong> LWSVO (National Workgroup of School Librarians in Secondary Education) assists <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>librarians in implementation of new developments in the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>library. They advocate a strong coordination between the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>library and the teachers in the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>for a better <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information literacy in the curriculum. LOOWI is a national platform for those involved in user <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and it has been also involved in arranging an Information Literacy conference <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on May 2003 (Boekhorst, 2003). Also <em>Stichting Lezen</em> (Reading Foundation) has <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>information literacy initiatives. In October 1996 the <em>Stichting Lezen</em> implemented its programme <em>School Libraries 2000</em> to improve the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>library services. Fifteen pilot projects, which were <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to provide a model for a national programme, started (<a href="#dej97">De Jong, 1997</a>). </p>

<p><strong>In Spain</strong> a working group on information literacy issues was recently set up in Catalu&ntilde;a under the name ALFINCAT. It includes a wide membership from other <span>regions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to exchange ideas, <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and good practice, and the advancement and promotion of the information literacy agenda (<a href="#gom03">G&oacute;mez Hern&aacute;ndez &amp; Pasadas Ure&ntilde;a, 2003</a>). </p>

<p>From November 1997 to May 1998, a working group was set up <strong>in France</strong> by the ministry responsible for <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> research and technology to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>training for the use of information.

<p><strong>In Germany</strong> the <em>Arbeitsgemeinschaft Informationskompetenz</em> (AGIK) was <span>founded</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>as an informal organization to exchange experiences in information literacy and to build up a minimal organizational platform for common activities in this field between German librarians.

<h3> Conferences and seminars on information literacy</h3>

<p>In recent years several <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>national, regional, and local conferences and seminars have been <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to address topics related to information literacy. For example, the first International Conference on Information Technology and Information Literacy was <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in Glasgow, Scotland, 20-22 March 2002 and the second conference was <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in June 2003. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>total of 143 people from 13 countries including librarians, information technologists and academics attended this first conference.  Rader (<a href="#rad02b">2002b</a>) and Webber (<a href="#Webb02">Webber, 2002</a>) have given good overviews of the conference and a book <em>Information and literacy: enabling learning in the 21st century</em> with selected conference papers is to be published with Martin and Rader as editors. The conference demonstrated the <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>about the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of a clear and agreed definition of information literacy or information skills in the UK. The <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to academic staff included <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>partnerships and encouraging the active promotion of information literacy programmes and the need to ensure that courses are integrated with academic programmes. Several examples of good practice were presented. </p>

<p><strong>At the Nordic level</strong>, the first international conference, <em>Creating Knowledge</em>, was <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in 1999 in Malm&ouml; to address information literacy <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in higher <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> However, the conference programme was quite broad and varied with engaging presentations, workshops and <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on a whole <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information literacy aspects. The second international conference <em>Creating <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>II </em>was arranged in Malm&ouml; in 2001 with presentations and workshops led by <span>distinguished</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>experts (for example, Christine Bruce). The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>conference <em>Creating <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>III</em> will be <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in Akureyri in Iceland in September, 2003. In the <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the conference will be <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>every second year in one of the Nordic countries (<a href="#sch02">Schr&ouml;der, 2002</a>). The Nordic seminar on information literacy (<em>Informationskompetens som utbildningsm&aring;l</em>) was also arranged in Tritonia-Vasa in February 6-8, 2003. According to the conference programme the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>discussion areas were: the importance of the guiding principles; are the Information Literacy Competency Standards in the US, United Kingdom, Australia and <span>Germany</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>similar; means of co-operation for teachers, IT-pedagogical support and librarians in order to improve information literacy in higher education; and, information literacy in <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(in basic, <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>level studies). </p>
  
<p>At national level several conferences, seminars and meetings have been arranged as well. For example, <strong>in Finland</strong> in 2000, the Undergraduate Library of the University of Helsinki organized a nationwide seminar in which Patricia Davitt Maughan from the University of California, Berkeley, USA gave a lecture on information literacy. In spring 2001 another nationwide seminar was organized in Helsinki by the Undergraduate Library and the Student Services Working Group of the Finnish Research Library Association to evaluate how well the targets would suit Finnish university <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> The same targets were discussed later at the meetings of the directors of university libraries in 2002 (<a href="#uni02">University of Helsinki, 2002</a>). The SCONUL model was presented in 2002 by Susie Andretta, from London Metropolitan University, at the <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>national information literacy seminar in 2002 in Helsinki. At this seminar a nationwide programme for the development of target-oriented information literacy <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>at all <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and polytechnics was <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#sin03">Sinikara &amp; J&auml;rvel&auml;inen, 2003</a>). </p>

<p><strong>In Denmark</strong> professional institutions and organizations have arranged several conferences in recent years ('Information competence via competent user <span>education</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>, 'The virtual educational library', 'Teaching with IT', 'Web-based learning in a library <span>perspective</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> and 'Development of pedagogic competencies') (<a href="#tru00">Trumpy, 2000</a>; <a href="#sko03">Skov &amp; Sk&#509;rbak, 2003</a>). </p>
  
<p>Several round <span>tables</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and study days have been organized <strong>in France</strong>. For example, a national study <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>was organised by the Association of French Librarians on 21 October 1999 on the information training of <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> Participants focused on directives in <span>force</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>regarding user training in university libraries, <span>accommodation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>for training sessions, co-operation with <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and other staff and evaluation of training given (<a href="#rio00">Riondet, 2000</a>). Desjardins <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to a round <span>table</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that was <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on 21 March 2000 and organized by the training unit of the <em>Ecole nationale superieure des sciences de l'information et des bibliotheques (Enssib)</em> in the <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of the Village e-book at the Salon du livre in Paris and what was devoted to the role of libraries in training users in information literacy and the means for achieving this task. Contributions focused, for example, on issues such as the types of <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>for users arising from both manipulating searches and from the structure of information on the Internet and in OPACs; the place of information retrieval in a university curriculum; and, the effect of training on the librarian/user relationship (<a href="#des00">Desjardins, 2000</a>).</p>
  
<p>Since the early 1990's presentations on user <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>have been a common <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in all professional conferences and meetings <strong>in Spain</strong>. In 2000 REBIUN (<em>Red de Bibliotecas Espa&ntilde;olas</em>), the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>for academic and research libraries in Spain <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>a workshop on the role of the library in <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and research where new developments and foci in student learning were one of the highlights. At the REBIUN meeting 'Learning and research resource centres' <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in innovative <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>processes' in Palma de Mallorca in May 2003, the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>was on new learning models for the information society and new <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>for the academic library, with information literacy as a strong <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in the agenda (<a href="#gom03">G&oacute;mez Hern&aacute;ndez &amp; Pasadas Ure&ntilde;a, 2003</a>). </p>
  
<p>Other conferences organized by European institutions and organizations have included information literacy to their programmes as well. For example, the LWW (Libraries Without Walls) conferences have paid <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to information literacy issues since 1995, while BOBCATSSS (the name BOBCATSSS is an acronym and describes the university <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in Europe. The letters stand for the first letters of city <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of the related universities: Budapest, Oslo, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Tampere, Stuttgart, Szombately, Sheffield), the Online London and EADTU conferences have included information literacy in their programmes for several years. For example, in recent years the LLS WG of EADTU has provided several sessions on information literacy during EADTU annual conferences (in Paris, <a href="#ead03">2000</a>, in Glamorgan <a href="#ead03">2002</a>) and at the International Conference on Distance Education (ICDE) (in Vienna 1999, in D&uuml;sseldorf 2001). </p>
  
<h3> Participation in information literacy movement at global level</h3>

<p>There are also several examples of initiatives and collaboration at global level where library and information professionals from Europe have been involved. Bundy notes that progressing information literacy as a global issue <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to a great extent on the strength of belief, resources and voice of local, national, and international library associations and adds that a scan of the Web-sites of a number of library associations reveals very uneven <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to the issue. Few have a policy statement as such, although some refer to the issue in the context of lifelong learning and the information society. The IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions) (IFLA) has no statement and it appears that none of the European, including the British associations, yet have one (<a href="#bun02">Bundy, 2002</a>). </p>
  
<p>However, at their meeting during the IFLA Boston conference in August 2001, the previous IFLA Round Table (RT) on User Education changed their name to the Information Literacy Section. At the meeting, the terms information literacy, user <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> and information competencies were discussed and the Executive Committee recommended the adoption of the first phrase 'information literacy' as the best <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to describe the work of the round <span>table</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> because it reflects more learning-oriented information <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> The first draft of the RT strategic plan was prepared with the audience's input. The mission statement was set up as follows:</p> 

<blockquote>The <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>purpose of the User Education RT is to foster international cooperation in information literacy in all types of libraries'. The priorities and <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>plan as well as the goals of the group are tightly connected with information literacy. One planned activity includes: 'to set up a committee to work a first draft on international guidelines on information literacy. (<a href="#ifl01">IFLA, 2001</a>).</blockquote> 

<p>It should be noted that librarians, for example from Finland, <span>Germany</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> Spain and Sweden, have been quite active in the activities of the IFLA Round Table on User Education as well as other initiatives.</p>
  
<p>The possible implementation of an international information literacy certificate (IILC) as a way of improving global information literacy will be discussed in an open session at the 69th IFLA Conference in <span>Berlin</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in 2003. According to Alvestrand (<a href="#alv03">2003</a>), Ross Shimmon, secretary general of IFLA, has said that there was a feeling that if the industry was going to make a serious attempt at making information literacy global, people need more than intuition, and a certificate would help. However, several professionals are concerned with how a certificate would <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>with context. Hilary Johnson, chair of the SCONUL committee and chief librarian at University College Northampton notes: <em>'I am not convinced you can divorce information literacy from a context in the way they seem to have managed to divorce IT from skills in the EDCL.'</em> (<a href="#alv03">Alvestrand, 2003</a>).</p>
  
<p>UNESCO has also entered into the information literacy arena: UNESCO, the US National Commission on Libraries and Information Science, and the National Forum on Information Literacy decided to arrange a 'Meeting of Experts' to be <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in early 2002 in Prague, for undertaking and planning a <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and more ambitious worldwide 'International Leadership Conference on Information Literacy'. The idea was to bring together a broad array of key professionals to capitalize on their experience and expertise in order to plan a worldwide conference. However, because of several obstacles the Prague information literacy meeting is being rescheduled and is <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to take place in autumn 2003. The NCLIS Website (<a href="http://www.nclis.gov/libinter/infolitconf&amp;meet/infolitconf&amp;meet.html">International Information
Literacy Conferences and Meetings</a>) provides thirty-one individual papers and the national case studies. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>paper from Bawden (<a href="#baw01">2001</a>) entitled 'Information and digital literacy: a review of concepts' has been provided as an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>background paper. It is <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that the results of the meeting can then be provided to the World Summit on the Information Society planned for Geneva in December 2003, and to other <span>bodies</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>worldwide, and it will be possible to <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>forward with plans for a Global Congress on Information Literacy. The papers prepared for the Meeting are clustered in the following: Economic <span>Development</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> Learning, People and Culture, People and Health, Policy, and National Case Studies. Representatives of nine European countries have been invited to the Meeting including Finland, France, Latvia, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom. It is interesting to note that representatives from Europe contribute to all clusters except the Learning Cluster and among five papers of the Policy Cluster, four originate from Europe (<a href="#mee02">Meeting of Experts, 2002</a>).</p>
  
<p>In March 2002, AOL Time Warner Foundation and the Bertelsmann Foundation sponsored a summit in <span>Berlin</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>Germany</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> entitled 'Twenty-first Century Literacy Summit'. More than 300 invited representatives from thirty-three countries and all five continents participated. As a result of the summit, a 'White Paper: 21st Century Literacy in a convergent Media World', was prepared. The <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of this White Paper is to help identify new standards of 21st Century Literacy.

The White Paper notes:</p>

<h2> Some examples of research on information literacy</h2>

<p>In the past decade, several European scholars have conducted research on aspects of information literacy. In this section only research activities explicitly claiming to have be connected with information literacy or cited by <span>prominent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>information literacy researchers were con0ered. </p>
  
<p>In the 1970s and 1980s a lot of research on information skills was undertaken <strong>in the UK</strong>. The British Library also published two important reviews of what researchers into information skills had been discovering and made recommendations to encourage more successful development of such skills in <span>schools</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> First, Irving's (<a href="#irv83">1983</a>) review analysed relevant research work in 1973-1983 and identified <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>directions. Her review ended: <em>'The research <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>had produced many stimulating and embryonic ideas' on what pupils should be taught about information skills, what hadn't been resolved was how this should be accomplished.'</em> (<a href="#rog94">Rogers, 1994</a>). The British Library's second research review <em>Perspectives on a partnership: information skills and <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>libraries 1983-1988</em> (<a href="#hee89">Heeks, 1989</a>) looked at the development of information skills in <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>library's role in this process. Heeks con0ered thirty-three official reports and research <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>published since Irving's review. The <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>was very much on the implications of the research for the <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>libraries and what Heeks called the information skills movement. It looked at the following themes: the difference between rhetoric and practice; the relationship of information to knowledge; inter-professional viewpoints; information technology; and the process of change. (<a href="#rog94">Rogers, 1994</a>). Several reports also highlighted a whole-school policy and even expressed doubts whether this approach is achievable. <span>Nevertheless</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> according to Rogers, examples of success in <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>towards whole-school policies were set out in Jack Sangers's report <em>The <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> handling information and learning project </em>(British Library research report 67), which ran from 1983-1986 and the two year project on <em>Information skills in GCSE and the Role of the Librarian</em>, which ended in November 1990 (<a href="#rog94">Rogers, 1994: 5-6</a>). </p>
  
<p>In recent years there have been several Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) funded projects concerning information literacy which have surveyed practice and provided case studies. For example, the project titled 'The Big Blue' was managed jointly by Manchester Metropolitan University Library and Leeds University Library and surveyed current practice in information skills training for <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in higher and post-16 <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> The project <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that there is still only a relatively small amount of published literature which relates to the UK experience of information skills and much of the literature describes <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information literacy programmes adopted by individual institutions. However, through an audit and case studies the Big Blue project has revealed many instances of good practice within individual institutions, but still had to point out that until the recognition of information skills as an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>graduate <span>attribute</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>has been recognised and/or addressed at national level, the inclusion of information skills in the curriculum will continue to be patchy (<a href="#tbb02">The Big Blue, 2002</a>). The JUBILEE (JISC User Behaviour in Information seeking: Longitudinal Evaluation of Electronic Information Services) at the University of Northumbria at Newcastle <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the possible impacts of Electronic Information Services (EIS) on information seeking behaviour (<a href="#jub02">JUBILEE, 2002</a>; <a href="#rad02a">Rader, 2002a</a>). The JUSTEIS Project at the University of Wales Aberystwyth Department of Information Studies, in conjunction with Information Automation Ltd's Centre for Information <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>Management, includes a general <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of end users of all electronic information services and a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of electronic information services (EIS) provision (<a href="#arm00">Armstrong, et al., 2000</a>; <a href="#jus02">JUSTEIS, 2002</a>). 
</p>

<p>In 2002 a research grant from the Arts and Humanities Research Board (AHRB) to study UK academics' conceptions of, and pedagogy for, information literacy was awarded to Webber and Johnston for three years. Work started in November 2002 at Sheffield University's Department of Information Studies. The study aims to answer the following research questions: What conceptions of information literacy are <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>by UK academics? How do these conceptions relate to previous research? What is academics' practice in educating <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>for information literacy? What is the relationship between conceptions and practice? Do differences in conception and practice correspond to differences in discipline? <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>phenomenographic method will be used for the first stages of research. (<a href="#uka02">Webber, 2002</a>). </p>

<p>There are also a few examples of research into various aspects of information literacy in the workplace. Alistar Mutch has reviewed the applicability of the information literacy concept in the private sector and the link between 'lifelong learning' and the 'learning organisation'. He proposes the adoption of a critical realist <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the nature of information literacy in this context (<a href="#mut96">Mutch, 1996</a>, <a href="#mut97">1997</a>, <a href="#mut00">2000</a>). </p>

<p><strong>In Sweden</strong> one of the earliest <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>is <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>Fj&auml;llbrant's (<a href="#fja76">

The use of phenomenography to determine varying ways of experiencing the information seeking and use process by Limberg from the Swedish School of Library and Information Studies is one of the few studies which has been widely reflected in <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>speaking world. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>research study conducted in Sweden in 1993-94 <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>twenty-five high <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>seniors' information-seeking behaviour related to fact-finding, balancing information and analysing information. Within the group of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>participating in the <span>investigation</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> three different ways of experiencing information seeking and use were identified. For some, information seeking was experienced as fact-finding, or <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>the right answer. These <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>wanted information that was easy to access, and disregarded what they con0ered to be biased information because of <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of facts. This approach to information seeking and use was associated with impoverished learning outcomes. Others experienced information seeking and use as balancing information in order to choose. These learners interpreted the information process as <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>sufficient information to allow them to form a personal standpoint on a <span>controversial</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>issue. Students experiencing information use this way still <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>answers to questions and found it difficult to manage subjective views on the issue. Students adopting a <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>approach to information seeking and use, experienced the process as scrutinizing and analysing.

<p>The dissertation of Lantz (<a href="#lan99">1999</a>), at Link&ouml;ping Univerity reported on a study of the information situations of small-company managers to arrive at an increased understanding of their information utilisation process. An interactional, <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>approach to the problems served as a theoretical construct of the study. The effects of barriers of an individual's information utilisation were seen as a dynamic <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>between the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and the organism in terms of the user's <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>system and the information barriers s/he encounters in an information <span>setting</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> The study used a <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>approach within the tradition of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>research. Case studies were made of the information situations of twenty-three managers from small manufacturing wood and <span>mechanical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>industries. Perceived information barriers were analysed at the individual, organizational and society level. The results indicated that information utilisation reflects both <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> The individual's, the manager's, information utilisation behaviour is based on and <span>controlled</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>by his <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>at hand and memory <span>representations</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>from the past. It was also shown that mediated by motivational and other affective states, the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of these <span>representations</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> of which perceived information barriers are important <span>constituents</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> guide his information utilisation behaviour. The results also indicated that educational measures seem to be a feasible way of minimising certain barriers and as the information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>continues to change, there is a need for a stable structure of support in order to bring about lasting changes. This study points to the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of breaking information barriers through information literacy. </p>
  
<p><strong>In Finland</strong>, at the Department of Information Studies at &Aring;bo Akademi University, a research project started in 1997 in which information and learning have been studied from many perspectives. The aim of this project was to study the relations between information behaviour and the learning process. The work of this project focused mainly on the following research questions: How are <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> information needs, seeking and use affected by the problem-based learning approach and by other student-oriented <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>methods? How does the individuals' personality influence his/her information behaviour and learning? Which type of personality has the ability of seeking information effectively? How does the role of the librarian change when we <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>from providing <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to support learning? Where do teachers and librarians meet in their tutorial roles? Does collaboration between teachers and information professionals affect the learning process? How does <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on information skills affect the learning process? Does provision of tailored <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>information resources affect the learning process? How can library instruction support the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> development to information literacy? (<a href="#ung00">Ungern-Sternberg, 2000</a>).The research project was composed of four parts: Eskola studied what kind of activating <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>methods are in use in Finnish <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and how <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>information behaviour is affected by these methods (<a href="#esk98">Eskola, 1998</a>). Heinstr&ouml;m's research is connected with the impact of personality on information behaviour and learning. Rosenqvist's area is the changing role of the librarian and the challenges from polytechnic <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and problem-based learning (<a href="#ung00">Ungern-Sternberg, 2000</a>). According to Eskola, in addition to the study of <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> library use, a few master and licentiate theses have been undertaken in Finland in the area of <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> information needs and uses at the Departments of Information Studies in Tampere and Oulu. For example, Rissanen has studied health care <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> information needs, uses and information literacy in a case study. Kautto has explored instruction given to <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>in seeking and using literature as a part of university <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#esk98">Eskola, 1998</a>). </p>
  
<p>Kari from the University of Tampere has examined information <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>(needs, seeking and use) in the context of paranormal information in a particular <span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> as experienced by people who are interested in the supernatural. The study is primarily theory-driven, and its conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>is grounded upon Dervin's sense-making theory. The basic elements, which are <span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> gap (need) and use, are enhanced by two new elements, construction (seeking) and barrier. This is done in an effort to develop a theory of information <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>that is more <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and unambiguous than the original sense-making theory. The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>objective of the study was to analyse the content of information <span>action</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> rather than its structure. The data was obtained by twenty micro-moment, time-line interviews conducted in Finland in 1995 (<a href="#kar98">Kari, 1998</a>). Some researchers have focused aspects of information seeking and use on the workplace and looked the use and <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information channels and sources in this context (<a href="#bys94">Bystrom &amp; J&auml;rvelin, 1994</a>). </p>
  
<p><strong>In the Netherlands</strong> Boekhorst of the University of Amsterdam completed his doctoral thesis on  information literacy. The Dutch <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>used for information literacy is <em>informatievaardigheden</em>.

<p>According to G&oacute;mez Hern&aacute;ndez &amp; Pasadas Ure&ntilde;a (<a href="#gom03">2003</a>) several doctoral dissertations <strong>in Spain</strong> are also related to information literacy. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>dissertation by Urbano in 1999 used a citation analysis <span>technique</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on the level of awareness and use of information sources by computing researchers in the University of Barcelona.

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>From this overview of the literature on information literacy activities in Europe it is apparent that much work has been undertaken on the part of librarians to deliver information-related competencies. Interest in 'information literacy' can be illustrated by the number of projects, conferences, workshops, working groups, adaptation of information literacy competency standards, <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>initiatives in many institutions, development of Web sites and Web-based tutorials, and in the area of research. However, while the majority of 'information literacy' initiatives and programmes in Europe have been initiated recently, librarians in Europe have been involved in delivering instruction in aspects of information literacy for many years. The initiatives outlined in this paper <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>only some examples in what one might call 'information literacy movement' in Europe. It is difficult to draw conclusions about information-competence developments in the whole of Europe as material published in <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>is quite rare and fragmented - many initiatives have been documented mainly in local <span>languages</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>but not in <span>English</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> However, it is possible to draw some preliminary conclusions.</p>
  
<p>First, the majority of recent initiatives come from formal <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>settings and examples in the workplace, <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and continuing <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>context are very rare. Two different paths can be followed: in some countries 'information literacy' initiatives started in the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>sector (UK, Netherlands, Spain), while in other countries academic libraries took the initiative (Scandinavia, Germany). In the mid-1980s there were several research projects on information skills in <span>schools</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> and several models have been developed and proposals made to teach aspects of information literacy. Information literacy initiatives in higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>have taken a variety of forms: stand-alone courses or <span>classes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> Web-based tutorials, course-related instruction, or course-integrated instruction. Although during earlier years much of the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>activities were <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>from the curriculum, now there are trends towards the <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of information literacy into subject areas. Some <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>have taken place into the question of whether 'information literacy' should be taught as a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>unit or integrated into the curriculum, but the majority favour the curriculum <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>model. Some institutions offer formal information literacy courses: these courses <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>from for-credit to non-credit, from required to elective.</p>

<p>There is also a shift towards increasing <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on faculty-librarian partnership and the implementation of <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>ICTs in delivering information literacy courses. However, implementation and delivery of information literacy <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span><span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on many factors: national as well as institutional policy, <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning <span>approaches</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> understandings and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of faculty and <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> and resources (budget, staffing, facilities, time). However, some specific <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of successful information literacy initiatives can be highlighted. Information literacy activities in several countries have been connected with the use of active learning methods, for example, with problem-based learning methods which presuppose that the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves collect, document and analyse the information they need to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>a problem. There must also be effective partnership: formation of partnerships between library and faculty is of the utmost importance. Several publications as well as the Websites of many higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>institutions show that there are several initiatives under way. Collaborative approach seems to be appreciated, especially in Nordic countries. Successful initiatives report on integrated 'information literacy' programmes and the <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>of the potential of <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>ICT to deliver 'information literacy' <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>is also a common <span>feature</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>
  
<p>The ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards are being <span>translated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and used in several countries. Although some researchers do not favour these 'skills-based' and 'measurable' models, <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>goals and having ways to assess whether <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>have met those goals is regarded as a good start. Several PhD studies, Masters Theses and other research projects have been conducted on aspects of 'information literacy' as well. However, most of them have focused on the educational <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
  
<p>There is little evidence of government initiatives but too heavy an <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>on technology infrastructure and basic IT skills in many countries. However, providing <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and teachers with the necessary technology to learn to access information in different ways is also important. It also seems that even some important forums have already taken the word 'information literacy' into their <span>vocabulary</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>to it as an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>competency for the 21st century, yet the majority of those concerned are librarians and information professionals. This may in part be due to the confusion caused by the varied terminologies and meanings discussed in this review. However, <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>initiatives can be <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and many researchers and institutions are developing their own <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>and models, while some EC projects <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:186px 62px 186px 62px;position:relative;">.</span>initiatives that are crossing disciplinary, institutional and national boundaries. Again, some efforts have been made to connect 'information literacy movements' at regional 
and European level as well as across the world. </p>

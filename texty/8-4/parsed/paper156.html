<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Research into access to electronic resources by visually impaired people, undertaken by the Centre for Research in Library and Information Management (CERLIM), is concerned with improving understanding of exclusion from access to digital information which can all too <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>occur when individuals do not have <span>so-called</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>'normal' vision. Advances in technology have enabled users to access resources in a variety of ways to suit their needs and requirements. This is particularly true in educational institutions, but also increasingly in public libraries, public information services and technology available in the home. For blind and visually impaired 
people, the Internet has enabled them to access the same resources as sighted people through the use of access technologies such as screen magnification, speech output and electronic Braille output. It is vital, however, to ensure access is provided fully. </p>

<p>Access can have several meanings, including physical access to <span>hardware</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as well as ensuring users can not only access or 'read' what is on the screen (be it using magnification, speech output or Braille output) but they can also interact with resources and services. This paper will describe research which has not only explored the accessibility of websites and levels of awareness in providing websites that adhere to <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for all principles, but has <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to enhance understanding of information seeking behaviour of blind and visually impaired people when using digital resources, with particular <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on the recently completed Non-Visual Access to the Digital Library project, funded by Resource: the Council for Museums, Archives and Libraries.</p>

<h2>Related research</h2>

<p>CERLIM undertook the Resource- and JISC-funded Resources for Visually Impaired Users of the Electronic Library (REVIEL) Project between 1997 and 1999 to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the state of accessible services in UK Higher Education institutions at that time. The project explored what would be needed to achieve national excellence in this field. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>model is presented in the Final Report of the Project (<a href="#bro99">Brophy 
and Craven, 1999</a>), which, if implemented, would help enable libraries to fulfil their responsibilities to provide inclusive services, ensuring that no-one is excluded because of their <span>visual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>impairment. As a result of this work, CERLIM contributed to the Resource-published <em>Library services for visually impaired 
people: a manual of best practice</em>, the aim of which is to provide &quot;a <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>guide for library managers and staff in the provision of library and information services for people with a <span>visual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>impairment&quot; (<a href="#hop00">Hopkins, 2000</a>). </p>

<p>The REVIEL project highlighted a need for more awareness among UK university libraries in the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and development of accessible library websites. As a result of this research, a supporting study was undertaken for Disability and Information Systems in Higher Education (DISinHE) to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>levels of awareness 
amongst library website designers of accessibility issues. Undertaken between 1999 and 2000, The <em>Equal Access for All </em>supporting study revealed that although there <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to be a general level of awareness of accessibility issues relating to the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and development of web pages within university 
libraries, <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>development was still required in order to ensure the accessibility of all library web pages (<a href="#cra00">Craven, 2000</a>). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>number of library staff were shown to have responsibility for the library web pages, but this was not always the case. Responsibility for the library web pages could also <span>rest</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with staff who had institution-wide web responsibilities or who managed a number of departmental pages, which also happened to include the library. This being the case, awareness raising activities were recommended to be targeted to staff (both management level and front line) of the institution as whole rather than being specific to the library and training and staff development materials also needed to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>this.</p>

<p>The study identified sources of help and advice on creating useful and accessible web sites. It produced a Good Practice <span>Guide</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> emphasising the importance of ensuring guidelines, recommendations and checking <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are in agreement with one another through the work and recommendations of the World Wide Web Consortium 
  (W3C).</p>
  
<p>There is evidence of continuing work to make interfaces accessible (see for 
example: the World Wide Web Consortium Web Accessibility Initiative (W3C/WAI)(<a href="#www00">World 
Wide Web Consortium, 2000</a>), the <a href="http://www.rnib.org.uk/">
Royal National Institute for the Blind </a> (RNIB) and the work of <a href="http://www.techdis.ac.uk/">
TechDis </a> , and on the development of interfaces <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>specifically for non-sighted people (see for example: Petrie and Morley (<a href="#pet98">1998</a>), Morley and others (<a href="#mor98">1998</a>) 
and Raman (<a href="#ram96">1996</a>)). However, there appears to be little current work published on how blind and visually impaired people <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>navigate interfaces, although some examples such as the study by Oppenheim and Selby (<a href="#opp99">1999</a>) and the work of <span>Jakob</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Nielsen have emerged in recent 
years. General work on information seeking behaviour and the use of interfaces still <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>visual capabilities which blind and visually impaired people may not <span>possess</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>
  
<p>A <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of understanding of different groups of users, such as blind and visually impaired people reinforces social and economic exclusion and will be of even greater <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in the <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as the information society develops.</p>
  
<h2>NoVA research objectives</h2>

<p>The Resource-funded Non-Visual Access to the Digital Library (NoVA) project aimed to address the issues described above by increasing our understanding of the retrieval of information by blind and visually impaired people, looking in particular at serial searching in non-serial digital library environments. Non-serial was defined for the project as web pages that displayed information using a variety of <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>such as frames, <span>tables</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> drop down menus and <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>edit boxes, rather than text displayed in a <span>purely</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>linear</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>way. </p>
  
<p>The research objectives were:</p>

<ul>
  <li> To examine current literature and draw on results from existing work in areas of accessibility, human <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>interaction</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> interface <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and information seeking behaviour.<br /></li>
  <li> To <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the information seeking behaviour of sighted and blind &amp; visually impaired people in non-serial, digital environments.<br /></li>
  <li> To evaluate results of the investigations and compare <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to searching in non-serial environments.<br /></li>
  <li> To report on <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and to make recommendations for the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of digital library <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><br /></li>
</ul>
  
<p>The <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>visually impaired is generally used to describe &quot;all those who have a seeing disability that cannot be corrected by glasses&quot; (<a href="#hop00">Hopkins, 2000</a>). This includes people who are entitled, under UK regulations, to register as blind or partially sighted. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>blind <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>can be registered as either blind or partially sighted based on the &quot;quality of distance and 0e vision as <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by consultant ophthalmologists&quot; (<a href="#hop00">Hopkins, 2000</a>). The <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of visually impaired users who took part in the NoVA research will therefore be <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to as &quot;visually impaired&quot; whether or not they had total or <span>partial</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>sight loss. This is in no way an attempt to over-simplify eye conditions, or to try and define the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as one homogenous group. It is merely an attempt to simplify the <span>terminology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>used in the report and to concentrate on the key issue of navigation where &quot;standard&quot; <span>visual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>cues are not available.</p>

<h2>NoVA research design</h2>

<p>An <span>experimental</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>was developed for the NoVA project in order to explore serial searching and retrieval in non-serial environments. Using a <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of desk research, task analysis and user interviews, the objectives of the study were to:</p>

<ul>
  <li> undertake a series of experiments with serial searching and retrieval, and <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>use of digital content, <br /></li>
  <li>to <span>map</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>serial/non-serial <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>so as to develop understanding of how serial searching, retrieval etc. can be optimised in non-serial environments,<br /></li>
  <li>to report on <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and to make recommendations for digital library system <span>design</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><br /></li>
</ul>

<p>Existing work examined in the literature cover areas of accessibility (<a href="#bro99">Brophy and Craven 1999</a>), human <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>interaction</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> interface <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and information seeking behaviour, both in general and in relation to blind and visually impaired people. Examples include work undertaken on information seeking: Marchionini and Komlodi (<a href="#mar98">1998</a>), Chen and Hernon (<a href="#che82">1982</a>), 
Choo, et al. (<a href="#cho99">1999</a>), Holscher and Strube (<a href="#hol00">2000</a>), Williamson, et al. (<a href="#will00">2000</a>) and work on human <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>interaction: Church (<a href="#chu99">1999</a>), Faulkner (<a href="#fau98">1998</a>) and Kline and Glinert (<a href="#kli95">1995</a>). General information seeking models, such as those developed by <span>Ellis</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#wils99">Wilson, 1999</a>), Wilson (<a href="#wils00">2000</a>), and Logan and Driscoll-Eagan (<a href="#log98">1998</a>), can be used by web and HCI designers to aid the development of user-friendly 
interfaces. However, whilst there is evidence of work on the information needs of blind and visually impaired people, there is less work specifically on information seeking behaviour of this group, although in recent years the work of the Nielsen Norman Group (<a href="#coy01">Coyne and Nielsen, 2001</a>), and research such 
as the Towel project (<a href="#har99">Harper et al, 1999</a>), have started to address user behaviour and usability issues. </p>
  
<h3>The sample</h3>

<p>In order to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>specific data on the way people <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>electronic sources, it was necessary to select a <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of people who were reasonably <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with using the Internet and (where appropriate) were comfortable using assistive technology. The <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>was made up of 20 sighted and 20 visually impaired people 
and was purposive, gathered partly on a voluntary basis and partly on a <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>basis. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>criterion was set to ensure that all the users included in each <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were at least <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with the Internet and with basic searching or browsing of sites.</p>
  
<p>Participants ranged in age from under 21 to over 50 years old. The visually impaired <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>included three users 21-30, eight users were 31-40, four were 41-50 and five users were over 50. The sighted <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>included three users who were under 21, ten users were 21-30, three were 31-40, two were 41-50 and two 
users were over 50. </p>
  
<p>The sighted <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were all able to read a standard (14&quot; - 15&quot;) screen. Ten of the visually impaired users had no vision at all or very little (i.e. a small <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of light perception); nine had some vision ranging from degenerative conditions to involuntary eye movements and one user could see print but needed access technology to be able to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>it. The majority of the visually impaired users in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>needed assistive technology to be able to read a standard (14&quot; - 15&quot;) size screen. Assistive technologies 
included screen readers, electronic Braille bars and screen magnification with speech output. One of the users could look at a standard size screen, but needed to use a screen reader to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the text. Others needed to be extremely close up to a standard screen to be able to read it, often with some <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as they would not be able to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a whole screen displaying different frames with different functions. </p>

<h3>Tasks</h3>

<p>Four web-based resources were used for the semi-structured tasks. These were a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>engine, a library OPAC, an online directory of resources and a commercial online shopping site. Although not all of these might be viewed strictly as digital library resources, the idea was to use a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of different interfaces, which these resources <span>offered</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The tasks were consistently set so that comparative analysis could take place between the sighted and visually impaired users. It was recognised that success in performing searches could be <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by previous knowledge or experience, either of the technology or the subject matter of the task, or by individual interpretation and approach to a task. In an attempt to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a balanced picture the tasks set covered a fairly broad subject base such as weather forecasts, shopping for clothes, travel information etc., using a &quot;simulated work task situation&quot; (<a href="#bor97">Borlund and Ingwersen, 1997</a>) to try and dispel feelings among the users that they were being tested in any way (although inevitably this still occurred to some extent).</p>

<p>To ensure everyone started from the same place, users were required to begin using the stated electronic resource. So for example, when asked to look for the national weather forecast for the UK, users were not allowed to simply type the Meteorological Office URL into the location box but had to start from the home page of the stated resource (a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>engine). Users were then allowed to choose whether they used the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>facility provided by the resource or to simply browse through the stated resource's site for relevant <span>links</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>engine, directory and the online shopping sites, for example, provided <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>from the 
home page to information required for the task, as well as offering a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>option. The OPAC was the only resource used where it was necessary to initially type something into the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>box, after which it was possible to browse through the site clicking on relevant <span>links</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
  
<p>Users were not given a time <span>limit</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to complete each task. At the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the session they were told that they could stop the task at any time and were given examples such as, &quot;if you are satisfied that you have found the information&quot;, &quot;if you are not satisfied, but think you have found all the information 
there is&quot;, &quot;if you are fed up with the task&quot;. Users were asked to <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to the observer when they wished to stop the task. This was done to help ensure completion was determined by the user rather than the observer. Once the user indicated that they wished to stop, the task was counted as &quot;completed&quot; whether or not they had found all, some or none of the information required. The reason for this was to try and simulate real life or &quot;work task&quot; information searching behaviour, where information required by a user may or may not be found from within a specific resource. &quot;Completion&quot; thus <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to the task and was not a judgment of the amount of information retrieved.</p>
  
<h3>Task recording</h3>

<p>Data was gathered using a <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of on-screen data capture (Lotus ScreenCam), sound recording and note <span>taking</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The use of sound recording was to provide a more <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>approach to transaction logging in an attempt to ascertain not only <strong>what</strong> the user had done but also <strong>why</strong> 
and <strong>how</strong> they felt about it.</p>

<p>Using a &quot;code and retrieve&quot; approach, each step of the NoVA <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>process was logged and coded to describe a particular <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>undertaken by the user. Movements from page to page were defined as serial steps. These included clicking on a link, or clicking on the back button and were coded as CO (Click 
On) and BACK. Movements within the screen were defined as <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>steps. These included actions such as typing in <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>terms (coded as TI), or scrolling up and down the screen (coded as CU and CD). </p>

<p>The observer <span>attempted</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>not to prompt subjects or give any instructions while the subject was performing the task. This <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>difficult at times, particularly when it was evident that the user was becoming distressed, as it was felt that undue stress was not a helpful way forward. Therefore, in some cases, the observer provided a &quot;hint&quot; to enable the user to continue. Nielsen suggests that this type of intervention is necessary in certain circumstances, as is prompting a user to ensure the transcription is accurately logged (<a href="#nie93">Nielsen, 1993</a>: 197).</p>
  
<h3>Pre-task and post-task interviews</h3>

<p>Users were asked a set of pre- and post-task questions. These <span>consisted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of a set of questions based on Ravden and Johnson's method of evaluating usability of human <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>interfaces (<a href="#rav89">Ravden and Johnson, 1989</a>). Questions were set in accordance with the &quot;person centred&quot; approach 
recommended by Duckett and Pratt (<a href="#duc01">Duckett and Pratt, 2001</a>) and began with a set of <strong>user profile questions</strong> to help draw up a profile of user <span>characteristics</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Questions included <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>such as age <span>range</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> use of the Internet, location of access and a brief <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of their <span>visual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>impairment (if appropriate). </p>
  
<p>The nature of a user's <span>visual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>impairment was gathered to provide a clearer picture of the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of users involved in the study rather than an indication of the problems faced by different impairments. Likewise, age and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>use were used as an indication of demographic spread rather than to analyse behaviour according to a <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>s age or ability. The aim of this was to adhere to a social model of disability which focuses on the &quot;social, economic and political barriers that 'disable' people who have impairments&quot; <a href="#duc01">(Duckett and Pratt, 2001</a>: 816), rather than a medical model which focuses on the 
disability itself and how it can be overcome to fit into society.</p>

<p>The interviews were also conducted to provide data on emotion, feelings and experience. These comprised <strong>general questions</strong>, such as how to tell a page is loading, initial comments about the interfaces and the type of information provided; and <strong>usability questions</strong>, such as their overall experience navigating around the resource. Interviews were conducted before (general) and after (usability) each task to help ensure the electronic resource and the task performed were still fresh in the user's mind before <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>
on to the next resource.</p>

<h2>Analysis of tasks</h2>

<h3>Time taken to complete task</h3>

<p>Completion of the task was counted when the user indicated this to the observer. Users were told that it was up to them to decide when they had found the required information - or when they wanted to stop searching. </p>
  
<p>Overall, visually impaired users took longer to complete each task although the amount of time taken varied between tasks. Observations highlighted that success of the task was often <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by the success in using some of the more <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of a screen reader and this depended on levels of user experience. Those who were experienced in using their chosen assistive technology made use of the different options <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and were able to have a greater <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of control in the way they interacted with a page.</p>
  
<p>The <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>engine and OPAC tasks took visually impaired users between three and five times longer to complete than the sighted users. There were exceptions of course, one visually impaired user, for example, completed the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>engine task in just two minutes using the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>facility. In this case he only 
had to listen to part of a <span>sentence</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>being read out by the screen reader to be able to understand and <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on (it should also be noted that the user's <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>terms were very specific and thus quickly retrieved relevant results). The visually impaired users were generally more efficient at completing the directory and online Shopping tasks than the Search Engine or OPAC tasks, but it still took them longer to complete than the sighted users. </p>

<p>Further <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is needed to examine the depth of searching undertaken by both <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in order to ascertain whether users stopped searching once they had found something <span>reasonable</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or whether they tried other searches or <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to check that they had found all the available information. </p>
  
<h3>Surveying the page</h3>

<p>Comparisons of <span>surveying</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>between the sighted users and visually impaired users (i.e., sighted users who looked at pages and visually impaired users who had text read out) show that there are similarities between the two groups. All users needed to spend some time <span>surveying</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a page or pages before deciding how to proceed, and the layout of the page affected their efficiency in <span>surveying</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The time spent on <span>surveying</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>differed between the two groups; for example, the sighted users could generally glance at a page, quickly scanning it for relevant information or <span>links</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Visually impaired users with screen magnification or who could look at a standard screen at close proximity could also scan pages to some extent, being able to control which part of the screen they surveyed. In contrast, visually impaired users with screen readers had to listening to text read out and this tended to take con0erably longer.</p>

<p>During the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>engine and OPAC tasks the sighted users surveyed pages on fewer occasions than the visually impaired users. Reasons derived from the visually impaired users' comments <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that pages surveyed during the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>engine task <span>contained</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>too much information, so that users had to <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>them at <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>intervals. <span>Terminology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>used on the OPAC site was unfamiliar to many of the visually impaired users, causing them to listen (or look at) pages several times before deciding how to proceed.</p>
  
<p>In contrast, the visually impaired users surveyed pages on fewer occasions than the sighted <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>during the directory and online shopping tasks. Comments from the visually impaired <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>suggest the information provided on these sites enabled them to find their way around without having to spend as much time <span>surveying</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>
  
<h3>Number of keystrokes </h3>

<p>Keystrokes logged for each task revealed that visually impaired users used 
  a <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of around sixteen different keystrokes, whereas the sighted users 
  consistently used the same six. Differences between keystrokes used by the visually 
  impaired users compared to the sighted users mainly related to the assistive 
  technologies used, which <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a variety of ways to navigate a page using 
  keystrokes such as the up and down arrow, the tab key, the return key and specific 
  control keys and short cut keys. Users interacting with standard PCs, however, 
  tended not to use control keys, relying <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on scrolling up and down the 
  page, typing in terms, selecting options and clicking on the return key.</p>
<p>In total, visually impaired users took more steps (serial and parallel) than 
  the sighted users. The Search Engine and OPAC tasks revealed the greatest difference 
  where visually impaired users took almost twice as many steps overall as the 
  sighted users. The Online Shopping task shows that visually impaired users took 
  more <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>steps than the sighted users, but took fewer serial steps (i.e. 
  movement within pages), indicating that the visually impaired users could locate 
  a relevant page quite efficiently but had to spend more time navigating within 
  a page in order to find the information. </p>
<p>The only task where visually impaired users took fewer steps overall (both 
  serial and parallel) was the Directory task, indicating that for this task visually 
  impaired users were able to locate the required information with a more efficient 
  use of steps than the sighted users. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>possible reason for this, derived from 
  observations and comments, was because those using a screen reader (the majority 
  of visually impaired users in the sample) had potentially relevant <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>such 
  as 'search', 'A-Z' and 'countries' read 
  out to them from the top menu almost as soon as they started the task. </p>
<h2>Analysis Of Pre And Post-Task Interviews</h2>
<h3>Page loading</h3>
<p>Users were asked how they could tell that a page was loading or had finished 
  loading. Visual clues were mentioned such as looking at the page loading on-screen 
  or at the browser icon <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>around, the <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>bar or messages such as 'Document 
  Done', but these were only useful if the user had enough sight to be able 
  to decipher icons or messages, or if they could use screen magnification. Those 
  using a screen reader mentioned aural clues such as listening to noises from 
  the hard drive, or waiting for the screen reader to start <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>out from the 
  top.</p>
<h3>Impressions of the interface</h3>
<p>Before commencing a task, users were asked to comment on the interface of each 
  resource, describing their first impression of the interface and what <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of 
  information they thought it was providing. Generally, both <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>commented 
  favourably if the information provided on screen was presented in a clear and 
  logical way (whether to look at in standard screen size, magnified or read out). 
</p>
<p>Users from both <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were less happy with pages that provided them with 
  too much information. The sighted users commented that pages with a large number 
  of <span>links</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> graphics and repeated menus sometimes <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><strong>&quot;cluttered&quot;</strong> 
  or <strong>&quot;busy&quot;</strong> to them, which was annoying. For visually 
  impaired users such pages were time consuming and overbearing and could discourage 
  the user from proceeding. </p>
<p>Interestingly, pages that were full of graphical <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>
  a problem for the visually impaired users as long as appropriate alternative 
  text was provided clearly describing where the link would take them. </p>
<h3>Navigating around the resource</h3>
<p>Visually impaired users found navigation of the Search Engine more of a problem 
  than the sighted users. In general the visually impaired users found it to be 
  <strong>&quot;unpleasant&quot;</strong> and with <strong>&quot;too much information&quot;</strong>, 
  whilst the sighted users found it quite easy and straightforward to navigate 
  (even if they did not like it). </p>
<p>Navigation of the Online Shopping site was less problematic for visually impaired 
  users than the Search Engine, with just under a half expressing positive feelings 
  about navigation. However, the site still had its frustrations, the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>problems 
  being the amount of duplicated information, the rather inflexible <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>facility 
  and <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the results. </p>
<p>Sighted users found navigating the OPAC site easier than the visually impaired 
  users, describing it as <strong>&quot;simple&quot;</strong> and <strong>&quot;intuitive&quot;</strong> 
  whereas comments from the visually impaired users described it as <strong>&quot;quite 
  confusing&quot;</strong> and that they had to <strong>&quot;use a lot of guesswork&quot;</strong>. 
  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>possible reason for this was that many of the sighted users were <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>
  with the layout of the site, whereas visually impaired users were less <span>familiar</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> 
  although some commented that it was an interface they could get used to if necessary.</p>
<p>The most popular site in terms of navigation was the Directory. Around three 
  quarters of the users (from both samples) expressed either positive or <span>neutral</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>
  feelings about navigation of this site, the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>problems expressed relating 
  to ambiguous or unclear descriptions (comments from both samples) and broken 
  or 'pixelated' text when using screen magnification.</p>
<h3>Getting lost</h3>
<p>Many of the users from both <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>experienced times when they were either 
  not sure where they were during a task or were unsure how to continue. This 
  did not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>cause users to give up on a task (unless it kept happening 
  or if they could not get back on track after several attempts). The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy 
  used by both the sighted and visually impaired users was to <strong>&quot;go 
  back&quot; </strong>a stage or even to <strong>&quot;start again&quot;</strong>.</p>
<p>During the Search Engine task visually impaired users had more problems telling 
  where they were than the sighted users. Over half said that they had moments 
  during the task when they felt partially or totally <span>lost</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> compared to just a 
  quarter of the sighted users.</p>
<p>Sighted users also seemed slightly better able to tell where they were during 
  the Online Shopping task (although the only two users to feel completely <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>
  were sighted). </p>
<p>During the OPAC task most of the users from both <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>knew where they were 
  and did not <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>feelings of getting <span>lost</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> However some were unsure how to 
  find the information required and were not always sure how to proceed. <span>Terminology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>
  rather than getting <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>seemed to be the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>stumbling block during this task 
  which, and as one visually impaired user commented: <strong>&quot;it needed 
  a bit of ingenuity&quot;</strong> to complete.</p>
<p>The Directory was <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the most successful site in terms of users knowing 
  where they were during the task. More sighted users expressed feelings of getting 
  <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or feeling confused than the visually impaired users, of whom only around 
  a quarter expressed any feelings of getting <span>lost</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The remaining visually impaired 
  users said it was clear where they were up to and that they back-tracked if 
  they were unsure at any time.</p>
<h2>Summary Of NoVA Research Findings</h2>
<p>Observations of users searching for information on the web reveal that, unsurprisingly, 
  people who are sighted find searching the web much easier than visually impaired 
  people. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> people who are visually impaired, but <span>possess</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>enough sight 
  to be able to see part of the screen (either up close or using magnification), 
  find searching the web easier than those whose sight is severely impaired (either 
  totally blind or very <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>sight). These <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are in <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with a study 
  conducted by the Nielsen Norman Group, which estimates that &quot;the Web is 
  about three times easier to use for sighted users than it is for users who are 
  blind or who have low vision&quot; (<a href="#coy01">Coyne and Nielsen, 2001</a> 
  p5). Findings from this study also revealed that people using screen magnification 
  had a higher success rate than those using a screen reader (although the difference 
  was not statistically significant).</p>
<p>Comparisons of time spent searching during the NoVA usability <span>tests</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>show that 
  visually impaired people have to spend more time searching for information than 
  sighted people (again this concurs with <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of <a href="#coy01">Coyne and 
  Nielsen, 2001</a>). However times can vary con0erably as the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of a site 
  can reduce the time needed if a number of simple <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are included, 
  such as a logical and meaningful menu, a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>facility and a <span>reduction</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in 
  the number of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>per page (as well as other accessibility <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>
  such as those recommended by the W3C/WAI). The acceptable <span>length</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of time spent 
  searching for information may have an impact on the success of a <span>search</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> as 
  on average users tended to stop after about 16 minutes whether they had found 
  all, some or none of the information they were looking for. </p>
<p>Logging the number of keystrokes (or the number of steps) people have to take 
  whilst undertaking a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>showed that visually impaired people take more than 
  twice the number of steps and have to interact with more than twice the number 
  of keystrokes than sighted users. The steps identified for the NoVA research 
  were broken into serial and <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>which enabled comparisons to be made between 
  the number of times people moved from page to page (or site to site) with the 
  number of times they have to <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>around a page. The studies show that visually 
  impaired users have to spend much more time navigating around a page than sighted 
  users, and have to use a greater variety of keystrokes to do so. </p>
<p>Even if the page adheres to accessibility recommendations it may have been 
  <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in a <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>way (i.e. with frames and tables). This has usability 
  issues for someone using a screen reader because they are often forced to navigate 
  in a serial or <span>linear</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>way and may have to spend more time navigating around 
  each page. </p>
<p>Observations indicated that screen readers forced users to navigate pages in 
  a serial way, which was not always appropriate for the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the page. For 
  example, pages with a large number of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for quick scanning, 
  but a screen reader will read out each link one by one which can be very difficult 
  to remember, and users often have to go back and listen to all the <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>again 
  in order to find (or not find) a <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>one. This makes the navigation process 
  con0erably longer and users expressed feelings of frustration - especially 
  if they were looking for something fairly simple. This can lead to frustration 
  and fatigue, and may <span>cause</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>them to stop altogether, which may result in users 
  missing out on potentially useful information and in extreme cases can discourage 
  them from using the web altogether. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>comment from one visually impaired user 
  was that &quot;at present is it a chore, a struggle and a bore to use the Internet&quot;.</p>
<p>Users who were more experienced in the use of assistive technology were better 
  able to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>within the page for specific information, <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>alphabetically, 
  navigate through <span>tables</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and frames and set preferences to avoid repeated <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>
  out of navigational <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>at the top of the page, but this was not the case 
  for all users. </p>
<p>It should be noted that users in the NoVA research were looking for information 
  prescribed by the task and therefore this could have <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>their motivation 
  to stop (i.e. the importance of <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the information may not have been as 
  great as information needed for other reasons). In real life information searching 
  situations, pages that prompt people to stop searching because they are complex 
  or cumbersome to navigate can still be a serious problem. Web designers need 
  to be aware that people will not carry on searching or browsing a site if they 
  have to spend too long or find it too <span>complicated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>- they will simply go elsewhere.</p>
<h2>Conclusions and Recommendations</h2>
<p>For successful browsing of sites, observations identified that hypertext <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>
  need to be placed in a logical order and given meaningful titles. Ideally the 
  page should not contain a long <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>links</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> but if this is <span>absolutely</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>necessary 
  then it should at least be in alphabetical order (or an alternative <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in 
  alphabetical order should be offered). The number of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>also had a bearing 
  on success, as the greater the number of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>per page the longer it took someone 
  to browse, particularly if using a screen reader. Ideally pages should not be 
  cluttered with <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(unless it is something like a site map), as a shallow 
  and deep structure (i.e. fewer <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>per page but with more pages per site) 
  has been identified in previous research as being the preferred approach for 
  someone who is blind or visually impaired (<a href="#bra99">Brazier and Jennings, 
  1999</a>). For web sites where it is not possible or <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to offer this

  facility as an alternative to browsing through <span>links</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
<p>For users who prefer to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a page rather than browse through it, a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>
  box should be placed in a <span>prominent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>place (such as near to the top of the screen). 
  This is preferred to providing a link to a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>search page as users were 
  sometimes confused by this, assuming &quot;search&quot; would be a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>box 
  and not a hypertext link. The <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>box should be simple and not too small 
  (an option to go to an <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>search may also be <span>offered</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> along with tips 
  on formulating <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>terms and queries) and if the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>facility is available 
  on all pages it should always be placed in the same position.</p>
<p>Observations showed that <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>varied between assistive technologies 
  and not everyone used the most up-to-date versions of <span>software</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Different types 
  of assistive technology presented different <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and problems to accessing 
  a web page. Observations identified problems with screen magnification such 
  as pixelated text (the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>problem in the usability tests), but enabled users 
  to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a page that had been <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in a <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>way with relative ease. 
  Screen readers presented many problems for users, such as not always <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>
  out every link or only <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>out what was on screen if it was partially minimized 
  or presented in a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>window. However, screen readers were the most popular 
  <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of assistive technology for the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of visually impaired users and, 
  if used to their full potential, could provide users with a number of <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>
  to aid navigation. </p>
<p>Observations during the NoVA usability <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>highlighted the fact that expertise 
  with the assistive technology used had a big impact on the success of the task. 
  Users who were aware of the different options <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by some of the more <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>
  screen <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>technology were able to have a greater <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of control in the 
  way they interacted with a page. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>greater <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>therefore needs to be given 
  to the provision of training for users, trainers and anyone who provides open 
  access computers with assistive technology.</p>
<p>Models of information seeking identified in the literature have been compared 
  with the information seeking tasks undertaken by users in the study and whilst 
  the <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the study did not allow time for in-depth analysis, models 
  identified as being particularly appropriate for <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis were the behavioural 
  model developed by <span>Ellis</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#wils99">Wilson, 1999</a>) and adapted by 
  Wilson (<a href="#wils00">2000</a>), and the Search Process Model by Logan and 
  Driscoll-Eagan (<a href="#log98">1998</a>). These models allow a <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of flexibility, 
  <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>into account <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>identified in the research that show searching 
  behaviour <span>differs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>according to the user, the task in hand, the resources used 
  and (in the case of visually impaired users) the assistive technology used. 
</p>
<p>Although awareness of web accessibility is increasing, visually impaired users 
  are still faced with huge problems when trying to navigate around some web sites. 
  As one visually impaired user commented:</p>
<blockquote>Sighted people just go click, click, click and there's the answer 
  .... while I'm still looking for the first bloody link.</blockquote>
<p>The overall aim of this study was to increase understanding of serial searching 
  in non-serial digital library environments, with particular <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to retrieval 
  of information by blind and visually impaired people. Although this has been 
  <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(and is reported in the Final Report of the study), there is a need 
  for further exploration into the information seeking behaviour of visually impaired 
  users, drawing on issues raised as a result of the study. Recommendations for 
  further research include:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Learning styles: how learning styles impact on visually impaired users' 
    access to information.<br /></li>
  <li> Motivations for searching: how the usability of a site might impact on 
    the motivation to continue (or stop) searching.<br /></li>
  <li> Information seeking models: further exploration of the use of information 
    seeking models to analyse the information seeking behaviour of blind and visually 
    impaired users, to help improve accessibility and usability of web sites.<br /></li>
  <li> The feasibility of developing a <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>checking tool which provides a 
    <span>map</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the stages necessary for searching by a user with screen reader technology 
    (i.e. examining <em>process </em>issues) should be <span>investigated</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Continued research into user behaviour will help inform web and <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>designers 
  of specific user issues relating to the information seeking behaviour of visually 
  impaired people, <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>accessibility a step further by focusing on the 'person 
  centred' rather than a 'system centred' approach and helping 
  to improve the information seeking experience of visually impaired people in 
  non-serial web-based environments.</p>

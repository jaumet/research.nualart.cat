The technique was       compared with the conventional n-gram technique using adjacent characters as n-grams. Several types of words and word pairs were studied.       English, German, and Swedish query keys against their Finnish spelling variants and Finnish morphological variants were matched using a target         word list of 119 000 Finnish words. In all cross-lingual tests done, the targeted s-gram matching technique outperformed the conventional       n-gram matching technique. The technique was highly effective also for monolingual word form variants. The effects of query key length and the                   length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) of the variants on the performance of s-grams were analyzed."

<H1>CLIR Research at the University of Tampere: issue Editorial</H1>

<H4><A href="mailto: pirkola@cc.jyu.fi">Ari Pirkola</A>&nbsp;<BR>Department of Information Studies<BR>&nbsp; University of Tampere<BR>Finland</H4>
<br><br>
<P>Cross-language information retrieval </I>(CLIR) refers to an 
information retrieval task where the language of queries is other than that of 
the retrieved documents. A user may present a query in his/her native language 
and in response the system retrieves documents in another language. Query 
translation can be done using thesauri, corpora, dictionaries or machine 
translation systems. An overview of different approaches to CLIR is in Oard and 
Diekema (<A href="#oard98">1998</A>). </p>

<P>This special issue of <I>Information Research</I> presents recent CLIR 
research done at the <I>University of Tampere</I> (UTA). We have adopted the 
dictionary-based approach. In <I>dictionary-based cross-language retrieval</I>, 
queries are translated by means of electronic dictionaries by replacing source 
language query keys with their target language equivalents. The main problems 
associated with dictionary-based CLIR are (1) untranslatable query keys due to 
the limitations of general dictionaries, (2) the processing of inflected words, 
(3) phrase identification and translation, and (4) lexical ambiguity in source 
and target languages. The category of untranslatable keys involves compound 
words, special terms, and cross-lingual spelling variants, i.e., equivalent 
words in different languages which differ slightly in spelling, particularly 
proper names and technical terms. </p>

<P>Earlier CLIR research done at UTA is summarized in Pirkola <I>et al.</I>. (<A 
href="#pirkola01">2001</A>). We have devised a <I>query structuring</I> 
technique. Many studies have shown that it is an effective disambiguation 
method, in particular in the case of long queries. We have tested different 
translation methods using <I>dictionary combinations</I> of general and domain 
specific dictionaries. Earlier CLIR research at UTA also involves the 
development of <I>morphological typology</I> of languages for IR. A set of 
computable variables characterizing the morphological features of natural 
languages were developed to be used in CLIR system development and evaluation. </p>

<P>The articles presented in this special issue deal with n-gram based matching 
of cross-lingual spelling variants and monolingual morphological variants, 
compound word processing in CLIR, and target language query disambiguation based 
on word frequency statistics of a document collection. </p>

<h2>N-gram matching for untranslatable keys</h2>

<P>General dictionaries only include the most commonly used proper names and 
technical terms. Most of them are untranslatable. A common method to handle 
untranslatable words in dictionary-based CLIR is to pass them as such to the 
final target language query. In many languages proper names and technical terms 
are spelling variants of each other. This allows the use of n-gram matching to 
find the target language correspondents of the source language query keys. In 
n-gram matching, query keys and index terms are split into the substrings of 
length n. The n-gram sets of keys and index terms are compared, and the best 
matching words are then used as query keys. </p>

<P>In their paper, Pirkola, Keskustalo, Lepp&auml;nen, K&auml;ns&auml;l&auml;, and J&auml;rvelin examine 
the effectiveness of digrams combined both of adjacent and <I>non-adjacent 
</I>characters of words in cross- and monolingual word form matching. They 
present a novel n-gram matching technique (called the <I>targeted s-gram 
matching </I>technique), in which n-grams are classified into categories on the 
basis of the number of skipped characters. The n-grams belonging to the same 
category are compared with one another, but not to n-grams belonging to 
different&nbsp; categories. The effectiveness of the technique is examined 
empirically. The results show that for Finnish-English, German-English, and 
Swedish-English cross-lingual spelling variants the technique outperforms the 
conventional n-gram matching technique using adjacent characters as n-grams. </p>

<h2>Compound words in CLIR</h2>

<P>Natural languages are productive systems that unlimitedly generate new 
compounds words. Some languages, such as Finnish, German, and Swedish are 
characterized by high percentage of compounds. Typically translation 
dictionaries of such languages include the lexicalised compounds. Most compounds 
are untranslatable, however. It is thus obvious that effective dictionary 
look-up and the searching of compound words in CLIR cannot solely be based on 
full compounds but also on their component parts. For good retrieval 
performance, compound splitting with a morphological analyzer and separate 
translation of component words are necessary. To promote phrase recognization, 
the component translations are recombined with a proximity operator in the 
target language query. </p>

<P>In her paper, Hedlund considers linguistic features of Finnish, German, and 
Swedish compound words, as well as CLIR compound processing, i.e., the 
decomposition of full compounds into their component parts, the normalization 
and translation of the component parts, and the recombination of component 
translations with proximity operators. In the paper, the effects of compound 
processing on CLIR performance are tested. </p>

<h2>The use of average term frequency in CLIR</h2>

<P>In their paper, Pirkola, Lepp&auml;nen, and J&auml;rvelin examine the utilization of 
average term frequency in CLIR. Dictionaries typically give many mistranslated 
words for source language keys. Many of the mistranslated words are general 
words whose average term frequency is low and document frequency high. The 
opposite holds for more specific terms which often are important keys in 
queries. These facts as a starting point, the researchers developed a query key 
goodness scheme (called the <I>RATF formula</I>, where RATF stands for 
<I>relative average term frequency</I>). The use of the RATF formula in CLIR is 
tested empirically. Query keys are weighted based on their RATF values. The 
assumption is that in this way good keys are given more weight than bad keys. 
Also other key weighting methods associated with RATF which particularly are 
suited for CLIR are tested. The results indicate that RATF-based CLIR queries 
often perform better than undisambigauated CLIR queries, but the results also 
indicate the limitations of the use of RATF in CLIR. <BR>&nbsp; </p>

<blockquote>Compound words form an important part of natural language.
From the cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) point of view it is
important that many natural languages are highly productive with compounds,
and translation resources cannot include entries for all compounds. Also,
compounds are often content bearing words in a sentence. In Swedish, German
and Finnish roughly one tenth of the words in a text prepared for information
retrieval purposes are compounds. Important research questions concerning
compound handling in dictionary-based cross-language information retrieval
are 1) compound splitting into components, 2) normalisation of components,
3) translation of components and 4) query structuring for compounds and
their components in the target language. The impact of compound processing
on the performance of the cross-language information retrieval process
is evaluated in this study and the results indicate that the effect is
clearly positive.</blockquote>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) deals with the problem of presenting
a query in one language and retrieving documents in one or several other
languages. The use of natural language in topics and documents makes it
obvious that many of the research questions deal with aspects of word morphology
and semantics (<a href="#Strzalkowski99">Strzalkowski <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>; <a href="#Smeaton99">Smeaton 1999</a>).
Compound words form an important part of natural language, since compounding
is a major way of forming new words. From the information retrieval (IR)
point of view, compounds may be content bearing words in natural language
sentences and therefore important for the retrieval result. Compound words
have been discussed in the main forums for research and evaluation on cross-language
information retrieval systems, the TREC conferences and the CLEF evaluation
forum <a href="#BM1">(1</a>). The problem with compound handling for cross-language
information retrieval is acknowledged for many languages, but we still
lack research results on the importance and effects to the retrieval result
of compound handling in natural language queries. In this study compound
words are analysed from the cross-language information retrieval perspective.
Methods of handling compounds in an automated process as well as the effects
of compound handling on retrieval results are presented.</p>

<p>Since natural language cross-language information retrieval is faced
with the task of identifying, normalising, translating and matching query
words to the database index, linguistic tools and linguistic analysis are
in use. Natural language analysis tools are also extended in information
retrieval and cross-language information retrieval applications also to
a sub-word level, e.g., morphological analysers are used for the decomposing
of compounds and normalisation of words (<a href="#Sparck99">Sparck
Jones 1999</a>). Normalization of words is a way to improve recall also
in monolingual information retrieval. By reducing the number of word forms,
more successful matches can be made (<a href="#Strzalkowski95">Strzalkowski
1995</a>). Stemming algorithms, able to produce word stems, are used for
the same purpose (<a href="#Porter80">Porter 1980</a>).</p>

<p>A general introduction to compounds and their relevance from an information
retrieval perspective is presented in Section 2. In dictionary-based cross-language
information retrieval, stemming or normalisation of words to base forms
using morphological analysis programs is necessary to be able to match
the right dictionary entry. Typically in Germanic languages (for example,
Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, German and Dutch) the compounds are joined
by special elements, "fogemorphemes" (<a href="#Hedlund01a">Hedlund
<em>et al.</em> 2001a</a>). However, splitting compounds into constituents using
morphological analysis programs does not necessarily produce lexical base
form words due to the use of "fogemorphemes", inflection, and word stems
to join compounds. Section 3 provides a description of compound formation
in three compound languages, Swedish, German and Finnish, the first two
being Germanic languages while Finnish is a Fenno-Ugrian language.</p>

<p>If one cannot translate a compound as a whole, one does not normally
get a one-to-one translation for each component in a compound, but rather
several alternative translations. Also, a component might remain untranslated
due to limitations in the lexicon of the morphological analyser or a translation
dictionary. It may also be a proper name or a spelling variant of a proper
name, or a spelling error. Components might also remain untranslated as
described above due to fogemorphemes and inflection.</p>

<p>For compounds containing more than two components we can in many cases
identify compounds within the original compound. For example the German
compound "<i>Universit&auml;tshochhaus" </i>contains the compound "<i>hochhaus</i>"
(<a href="#Warren78">Warren 1978</a>).</p>

<p>Compound based structuring and the use of proximity operators have been
tested for several language pairs at the University of Tampere by Pirkola
(<a href="#Pirkola98">1998</a>), and Hedlund <em>et al.</em>

(<a href="#Hedlund01b"> 2001b</a>; <a href="#Hedlund01c">2001c</a>).
Methods for component processing, handling fogemorphemes and the use of
proximity operators are presented in Section 4, followed by a discussion
in Section 5 on the relevance of the findings and their importance to cross-language
information retrieval research.</p>


<h2>Compound definitions, categories and relevance from an information retrieval perspective</h2>

<p>Compounds can be defined according to orthography (<a href="#Akmajian97">Akmajian
<em>et al.</em> 1997</a>), namely compounds where the components are written together
and compounds in the form of phrases. The way to form compounds, that is,
joining words together into one word or having them separated as a phrase
is a language dependent feature. Swedish, German, Dutch and many other
Germanic languages belong to the former type, likewise Finnish (a Fenno-Ugric
language), while English and French are examples of the latter one. In
this study, the term <i>compound</i> refers to a case where the components
are written together. The term <i>phrase</i> refers to a case where components
are written separately.</p>

<p>What is important for purposes of information retrieval is the categorisation
according to the part of speech of the components. The combinations are
numerous, we can identify noun - noun (raindrop), adjective - noun (bluebell),
adjective - adjective (light green), noun - verb (heart-broken), preposition
- verb (over-ride) as common combinations but also many others. The part
of speech of the compound is normally defined on the basis of the last
component (<a href="#Malmgren94">Malmgren 1994</a>; <a href="#Akmajian97">Akmajian
<em>et al.</em> 1997</a>). From the information retrieval point of view nouns and
combinations containing nouns are often content-bearing words and therefore
mo! st! important. The syntactic structure of compounds, components within
components, and the left- or right-branching structure are used for compound
handling strategies in this study. Compounds also have a paradigmatic structure,
e.g., berry is a hyperonym of several types of berries (blueberry, strawberry).</p>

<p>Compounds are used to form new words in a language and are therefore
productive. The word formation process is complex and different stages
can be identified. We have <b>occasional compounds</b> that are used to
express a specific thing or process, e.g., (<i>skolbokshylla, </i>a Swedish
word for a shelf containing school books). When forming a new concept as
a compound, the semantic structure is often <b>transparent </b>or <b>compositional

</b>(<a href="#Malmgren94">Malmgren
1994</a>). The meaning of the compositional compounds can be derived from
the meanings of their components, e.g., <i>Handelsvertrag, </i>a German
word for trade agreement where the components are <i>Handel </i>(trade)
and <i>Vertrag </i>(agreement).</p>

<p>When a compound is frequently used in a language the denotation of the
original transparent compound is sometimes transformed into a special concept.
In Finnish the word refrigerator is <i>j&auml;&auml;kaappi </i>(<i>j&auml;&auml;

= </i>ice and <i>kaappi =</i> cupboard), which is no longer a cupboard
containing ice, but has the special meaning of refrigerator. The compound
is stable and is no longer an occasional compound.</p>

<p>Compounds where the meaning of the compound cannot be derived directly
from the meanings of the components are <b>opaque </b>or<b> non-compositional</b>,
e.g., the English word <i>strawberry </i>and the Swedish word <i>jordgubbe</i>

(meaning strawberry). The word for towel in German <i>Handtuch</i> (hand
cloth or towel) is opaque to a certain degree but we can identify a semantic
relationship to the components forming the compound. This is quite a usual
pattern for compounds and completely opaque compounds are not very common
(<a href="#Fleischer92">Fleischer &amp; Barz 1992</a>). Opaque compounds
denote in many cases common concepts and are therefore <b>lexicalised</b>
and can often be found in dictionaries.</p>

<p>From the information retrieval point of view and especially for the
translation process in cross-language information retrieval using dictionaries
the categorisation presented above is important. Occasional compounds rarely
appear as entries in translation dictionaries, transparent compounds may
appear as entries in comprehensive dictionaries or dictionaries created
for a special domain. The word <i>Handelsvertrag </i>(trade agreement)
is most certainly appears in a dictionary of economics, whereas frequent
opaque and lexicalised compounds often appear as entries even in small
general translation dictionaries.</p>

<p>For the above-mentioned reasons we need ways to handle compounds in
dictionary-based cross-language information retrieval when they cannot
be directly translated. A solution is to split the compounds into components
and translate them separately since the components can be seen as contents
bearers from the information retrieval point of view. This holds for many
transparent and occasional compounds. In many cases the splitting of non-compositional
compounds and translating the components often increases ambiguity, and
adds no value to the retrieval performance. The automatic translation process
(below) is designed to work in a way similar to human understanding
of language. If a compound word is found in the dictionary it will be translated,
and only if not will the process of splitting it into components and translating
them take place.</p>

<h2>Compound formation in Swedish, German and Finnish</font></h2>

<p>The simplest form of compound formation is to join two word stems, base
forms or inflected forms, e.g., the Swedish word, <i>livb&aring;t, </i>(lifeboat)
of <i>liv </i>(life) and <i>b&aring;t </i>(boat). This new word can in
turn be joined to form other words, e.g., <i>livb&aring;tsbes&auml;ttning</i>

(lifeboat crew). The German word <i>Welthandel </i>(world trade) is formed
from <i>Welt</i> (world) and <i>Handel </i>(trade) and is a part of a compound
<i>Welthandelsorganisation</i>(world trade organization). Similarly the Finnish word <i>Lentokoneonnettomuus</i>
(air plane accident) is formed of the three components <i>lento </i>(flight)
<i>kone</i>(machine) and <i>onnettomuus </i>(accident). Note that in Swedish and German the
fogemorpheme "s" is used to join the constituents (see Figure 1). Several components in
a compound usually indicate that the compound is occasional. In English compounds in the form of phrases
are common, as can be seen in the translations of the examples above.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p128fig1.jpg" width="670" height="492" border="0" alt=""></div>

<div align="center">Figure 1. Examples of compound noun formation in Swedish, German and Finnish</div>

<p>The use of fogemorphemes to join compound is typical of the Germanic
languages. In Swedish the fogemorpheme types are as follows:<br>
<br><i>- (omission)__ flick(a)namn</i> (maiden name)
<br><i>-s______r&auml;tt<b>s</b>fall </i>(legal case)
<br><i>-e_____ flick<b><u>e</u></b>barn </i>(female child)

<br><i>-a_____ g&auml;st<b><u>a</u></b>bud </i>(feast, banquet)
<br><i>-u_____ gat<b><u>u</u></b>belysning </i>(street lighting)
<br><i>-o_____ m&auml;nnisk<b><u>o</u></b>k&auml;rlek</i> (love of mankind)
<br>&nbsp;

<p>Sometimes the component preceding the fogemorpheme is a stem, e.g.,
<i>gat(a)</i>
sometimes a base form, e.g., <i>r&auml;tt. </i>From the information retrieval
point of view, proper weighting of index terms and effective matching require
that fogemorphemes be handled and correct base forms of component words
identified.
<p>In German the most common fogemorpheme types are:<br>
<br><i>-s_____ Handel<b><u>s</u></b>vertrag </i>(trade agreement)
<br><i>-n_____ Affe<b><u>n</u></b>haus</i> (monkey house)

<br><i>-e_____ G&auml;st<b><u>e</u></b>bett </i>(guest bed)
<br><i>-en____ Fotograph<b><u>en</u></b>ausbildung </i>(training of photographers)
<br><i>-er____ Gespenst<b><u>er</u></b>haus </i>(ghost house or haunted
house)
<br><i>-es____ Freund<b><u>es</u></b>kreis </i>(circle of friends)

<br><i>-ens___ Herz<b><u>ens</u></b>brecher </i>(hearthbreaker)
<br><i>- (omission)__ Sprach(e)wissenschaft </i>(linguistics)</p>

<p>The morpheme boundaries of the constituents in a compound are called
fogemorphemes in Swedish, Fuge-elements in German. They mark the elements
of one constituent and the following constituent in a compound and are
mostly connected with nouns and sometimes verbs as the first element of
a compound. For the use of fogemorphemes some rules can be established
but there is no complete scheme for how the components are connected (<a href="#Fleischer92">Fleischer
&amp; Barz 1992</a>). They are historically often derived from plurals,
from oblique case suffixes and combinations of the two.</p>

<p>Although there are no fogemorphemes in the Finnish language, compound
splitting can still produce components in inflected forms or in the form
of derivatives. For example the compound noun <i>tupakastavieroituskurssi

</i>(course
to break the habit of smoking) includes the components <i>tupakasta
</i>(an
inflected form of <i>tupakka = </i>tobacco), <i>vieroitus </i>(wean, a
derived form of <i>vieroittaa </i>= wean, to break a habit) and <i>kurssi
</i>(a
base form for course).</p>

<p>To give an indication of the frequency of compounds in text for different
languages a sample of 100,000 words of newspaper text was collected for
each language (Swedish, Finnish and German) in this study. The text corpus
was processed in a way similar to building up a document database index.
Stop words, that is, frequent words, e.g. articles and pronouns in the
text were eliminated. Then the text was processed by a morphological analyser,
and the criteria for a compound was that it could be separated into constituents
by a morphological analyser. The test indicated that for Finnish 8.7%,
for Swedish 9.8% and for German 10.2% of the words are compounds.</p>

<p>We can clearly see common patterns in compound formation in the three
different languages. The Germanic languages, Swedish and German, naturally
have more in common, but for information retrieval or cross-language information
retrieval purposes solutions for how to handle compounds may to some extent
be language independent. In information retrieval and cross-language information
retrieval we need to identify compound components for translation, and
that means considering how to handle fogemorphemes, word stems and inflected
word forms. In the following section compounds are processed for a bilingual
translation process.</p>

<h2>Compound processing for bilingual cross-language information retrieval</h2>

<p>The problems with compounds and compound splitting in Germanic languages
(German, Dutch, Swedish) were mentioned as important in several papers
presented at the Cross-language Evaluation Forum (2001). Generally compound
splitting and the translation of components is found to improve retrieval
results (<a href="#Savoy01">Savoy 2001</a>; <a href="#Kraaij01">Kraaij
2001</a>; <a href="#Riplinger01">Riplinger 2001</a>; <a href="#Hedlund01c">Hedlund
<em>et al.</em>2001c</a>).</p>

<p>In this section problems and solutions to three important questions
concerning compounds in dictionary based cross-language information retrieval
are discussed. They are 1) normalisation, 2) translation of components
and 3) query structuring of components in the target language. Since the
impact of compound processing on the actual query process is of interest,
evaluation results for this way of processing compounds will be presented.</p>

<h3>Normalisation of components</h3>

<p>Morphological analysers used to decompose compounds into constituents are
effective, but do not necessarily present the constituents in base forms.
This is especially the case with analysers for Germanic languages with
fogemorphemes, but also words containing components that are stems or inflected
word forms are not automatically normalised and presented in base forms.
<p>Fogemorpheme algorithms to transform the output of morphological analyzers
to base form words have been tested for Swedish - English translations
using CLEF 2000 Swedish test queries (<a href="#Hedlund01b">Hedlund et
al. 2001b</a>). The algorithms are able to handle only the most common
fogemorphemes. Table 1, presents the translation results of a sample of
10 compounds including fogemorphemes is presented.</p>

<p>The algorithm fails to normalise the component <i>samarbets</i> (samarbet
is a word stem) to the right base form <i>samarbete</i> (co-operation)
and for the word <i>bek&auml;mpning</i> the dictionary did not provide
any translation. In some examples, the sense of the Swedish compound does
not transform into a correct English phrase although components are found
in the dictionary. We obtain nonsense combinations like "aviation plane
accident","article building roof", "goods building roof". The reason for
this is that the Swedish compounds contain non-compositional compounds
as components <i>flygplan</i> (aeroplane) and <i>varuhus</i> (department
store). This phenomenon is discussed later in Section 4.2. However, the
algorithm developed and used for handling fogemorphemes, obviously reduces
the number of non-translated components.</p>

<p>Two different automatic test runs, (<a href="#BM4">4</a>) one using
the fogemorpheme algorithm and one without it were performed with the CLEF
2000 test set of Swedish topics and the English document database provided
by CLEF. The average precision rates over 11 recall levels from 0 to 100
for the eleven queries containing fogemorphemes indicate a slight effect
on the result (Table 2).</p>

<p>For individual queries the effect depends on whether the translated
compound components can express the sense of the original word in the translation.
For non-compositional compounds the effect of compound splitting and fogemorpheme
handling does not have any effect, or the effect is negative, since additional
translations add noise to the query. However, since we are dealing with
constituents of compounds the actual effect on the search result also depends
on other factors, such as to what extent the constituents are important
topic words. A similar algorithm for German has been developed and used
in dictionary-based cross-language information retrieval tests (<a href="#Hedlund01c">Hedlund
<em>et al.</em> 2001c</a>).</p>

<p>The inflected word forms appearing as constituents, e.g., the Finnish
word <i>ymp&auml;rist&ouml;n|suojelu </i>(environment protection), where
the first component is the genitive form of <i>ymp&auml;rist&ouml; </i>(environment),
also need to be normalised to base form in order to match the entries of
a translation dictionary. A morphological analyser can be helpful in this
case, by normalising the compound components to base forms in a two-stage
process. The original compound is first decomposed into components and
then the single components are normalised.</p>

<p>By applying these two features to a system for compound processing the
majority of the compounds can be handled for translation. The unsolved
problem with component normalisation is word stems and other irregularities
in compound formation; they cannot be handled easily in an automated process.</p>


<h3>Component translation and structuring of queries</h3>

<p>A problem with splitting compounds in cross-language information retrieval
is to find an optimal solution as to how to combine the translation alternatives
in the final query structure. This is especially true for multi-compositional
compounds (three or more components). Multi-compositional compounds are
quite frequently used in text. For example, the Swedish word <i>metangasfyndigheter
</i>(deposits
for methane gas) is composed of three components, <i>metan gas fyndigheter
</i>(deposits).
A general Swedish - English dictionary gives the following translations
(Table 3).</p>

<p>A solution using structuring of the translation alternatives for Finnish
to English CLIR was originally developed by Pirkola (<a href="#Pirkola98">1998</a>).
It includes the translation of every component and combining each translation
equivalent to each other using a proximity operator. The proximity statements
are joined using the syn-operator of the InQuery retrieval system. Different
grouping strategies of components in combination with a proximity structure
have been used in later CLIR studies by Hedlund <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#Hedlund01b">2001b</a>;
<a href="#Hedlund01c">2001c</a>).</p>

<p>For the example key above, the initial query structure used in Hedlund
<em>et al.</em> (<a href="#Hedlund01b">2001b</a>) combines all the component translations
in a synonym structure using a strict word order operator "OD" and a proximity
operator 5 allowing the window size to span enveloping 6 words (<a href="#BM2">2</a>).
See Figure 2. For proximity operators see Section 4.3.</p>

<blockquote>#syn(#od5(methane gas deposit) #od5(methane gauze deposit)).</blockquote>

<div align="center"><img src="p128fig2.jpg" width="328" height="211" border="0" alt=""></div>

<div align="center">Figure 2: Query structure for the three component compound</div>

<p>This construction when matched to a document database index requires
that all words in the construction in this exact order match the document
index. It would thus not be able to retrieve a paraphrased version of the
concept, e.g., "deposit of methane gas" or the word pair "methane gas".
In the worst case this might affect the retrieval result negatively due
to no matches for this concept.</p>

<p>The syntactic structure of a compound can almost always be divided into
two main constituents. These may in turn be made up of compounds or other
complex units (<a href="#Malmgren94">Malmgren 1994</a>; <a href="#Warren78">Warren
1978</a>). The structure is either left branching or right branching (see
Figure 3). An alternative, according to the above mentioned structure is
to group the components into pairs of consecutive components in order to
form meaningful pairs. This has been and tested by Hedlund <em>et al.</em>(<a href="#Hedlund01c">2001c</a>).</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p128fig3.jpg" width="671" height="242" border="0" alt=""></div>

<div align="center">Figure 3. Left branched and right branched compound structure.</div>

<p>The previous example grouped into consecutive pairs would be as follows.
Note that also the word order operator is changed to unordered window (UW):</p>

<blockquote>#syn(#uw5(methane gas) #uw5(methane gauze) #uw5(gas deposit)
#uw5(gauze deposit).</blockquote>

<blockquote>More formally this is expressed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Compound word = <i>CW </i>[<i>comp<sub>1</sub></i>+<i>comp<sub>2</sub></i>+<i>comp<sub>3</sub></i>+...<i>comp<sub>n</sub></i>]</blockquote>

<blockquote>Consecutive pairs, <i>(i,i+1)</i> are formed, <i>i</i>=1...<i>n</i>-1</blockquote>

<blockquote>where <i>n </i>is the number of components.</blockquote>

<p>The other aspect, also discussed in Section 3, is that compounds in many
cases also contain components that themselves are compounds. These are
naturally consecutive. In the above example both the components <i>metan</i> and <i>gas</i> form
the compound <i>metangas</i> and the components <i>gas</i> and <i>fyndighet</i> form the compound <i>gasfyndighet </i> (gas deposit).  In an earlier study by Hedlund <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#Hedlund01c"> 2001c</a>) our attempt was made to translate all component pairs directly by looking them up in a translation dictionary. For example, if the words

<i>metangas</i> and <i>gasfyndighet</i> can be translated to methane gas and gas deposit, the query formulation
would be like this:</p>

<blockquote>#syn(#uw5(methane gas) #uw5(gas deposit)).</blockquote>

<p>Another problem with compounds is that not all components are included in a dictionary, for example in Section 4.1, Table 1, the Swedish compound <i>brandbek&auml;mpningsolyckor</i> (accidents in fire fighting). The components are <i>brand</i> (fire) <i>bek&auml;mpning</i> (fighting) <i>olyckor</i> (accidents, conflagrations). In this case the word <i>bek&auml;mpning</i> is not translated by a sample dictionary. Combinations including a word in a foreign language
do not usually retrieve any documents.</p>

<blockquote>#syn (#uw5(fire bek&auml;mpning) #uw5(bek&auml;mpning accident)
#uw5(bek&auml;mpning conflagration))</blockquote>

<p>Moving the untranslatable component outside the proximity construction
can be helpful for the matching process.</p>

<blockquote>#syn(bek&auml;mpning #uw5(fire accident) #uw5(fire conflagration)).</blockquote>

<p>The idea of still having it as part of the SYN construction is that if it is a proper name or a loan word the matching with the document database could still take place.</p> 

<p>The phenomenon of untranslatable constituents in compounds is of immediate
interest for several source languages used in dictionary-based bilingual
cross-language information retrieval. In a test with Finnish queries in
an English document database (47 test queries from the CLEF 2001 collection)
the effect is hardly noticeable in the average precision over recall values
for all the queries. However, for some individual queries containing untranslated
compound components the effect is greater (see Table 3).</p>

<h3>Proximity operators and window size</h3>

<p>Compounds in German, Swedish and Finnish are usually translated into English using a phrase construction, e.g., the German compound <i>Fussballweltmeisterschaft</i> is translated as "world soccer championship", the Swedish <i>Eutanasifall</i> as "incidents of euthanasia", and the Finnish <i>Tietokonevirus </i>as "computer virus" <a href="#BM3">(3</a>). The importance of using phrases in and problems with phrase identification for CLIR is discussed in Ballesteros and Croft <a href="#Ballesteros97">(1997</a>).</p>

<p>Windowing techniques and the span for the text window or window size have been discussed for use in information retrieval by Jacquemin (<a href="#Jacquemin96">1996</a>) and Haas and Losee <a href="#Haas94">(1994</a>). In the study by Jacquemin a linguistic approach is taken and the author stresses that the words included in the window should be lexically and syntactically related or constitute of a correct partial noun phrase. Haas and Losee focus on an optimal window size and confirm that limiting the span of the words to between three and five is a good value. Zhou (<a href="#Zhou99">1999</a>) has documented phrasal terms in English documents. The findings show a clear predominance
of two-word phrases (75.9%), while three-word phrases were not very common (14.4%). A window size of five words and a free word order would according to the findings of Zhou cover most (roughly 95%) of the phrases. <p>These results give some background knowledge on the processing of compounds for bilingual CLIR when the source language is a compound rich language and the target language in most cases uses a phrase instead of a joint compound. A direct translation by looking up a compound in a bilingual dictionary would give a phrase as translation equivalent, e.g., <i>Welthandelsorganisation</i> (world trade organisation). The translation can be marked as a phrase #2(world
trade organisation). This meaning that the exact sequence of words, in this word order, has to match the document database, in order to retrieve relevant documents on this subject.</p>

<p>Enlarging the window size and allowing for any word order #uw5(world trade organisation) means that a document containing the phrase &quot;organisation for world trade&quot; would be retrieved. But we would not get a match for the phrases &quot;trade organisation&quot; or &quot;world trade&quot;.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if the source compound word is split into the constituents <i>Welt,
Handel</i> and <i>Organisation,</i> and these are grouped according to the rules in Section 4.2., e.g., <i>Welt+handel </i> and <i>Handel+s+Organisation</i> we could get direct translations of the component pairs, forming the phrases
&quot;world trade&quot; and &quot;trade organisation&quot;.</p>

<p>Proximity operators and window size can also be used in cases where no direct translations for the whole compound nor for constituent pairs can be obtained. If in the above case the split components: <i>Welt </i>(world, universe), <i>Handel</i> (trade, business), <i>Organisation </i>(organisation), and the combinations that can be made, are marked as phrases we would get the following combinations, using a synonym structure:</p>

<p>#syn(#uw5(world trade organisation) #uw5(world business organisation) #uw5(universe trade organisation) #uw5(universe business organisation))</p>

<p>Both the proximity operators #od and #uw have been used in cross-language
information retrieval tests in the studies by Hedlund <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#Hedlund01b">

2001b</a>; <a href="#Hedlund01c">2001c</a>) for the CLEF campaigns 2000
and 2001. The actual effect of changing the word order operator and the
window size is small. A test with Finnish - English bilingual CLIR (47
Finnish topics, English document database) showed no actual effect in the
average precision values over all recall levels 0 to 100 for all the 47
queries (see Table 5).</p>

<p>The positive effect is noticeable only for three individual queries (queries 45, 63 and 86 in Table 5). The test, however, shows that the free word order operator (#uw) might be a better choice in an automated system since for 44 queries the result was better or equal and the largest negative result was an average precision drop of 0,0015 (query 48 in Table 5).</p>


<h3>Effects of compound processing in bilingual cross-language information retrieval</font></h3>

<p>To evaluate the effect of compound handling in an automated process for
bilingual dictionary based CLIR several tests with German CLEF 2001 topics
and the English document collection were performed. The test runs were
performed by using different translation resources for the same 47 German
topics (see also the study by Hedlund <em>et al.</em> <a href="#Hedlund01c">( 2001c</a>).
The resources were 1) a comprehensive dictionary, containing translations
for many compounds, 2) the same dictionary, except that every compound
word was first removed from it. This limited dictionary thus contains no
direct translations for compound words. A direct translation through a
comprehensive dictionary has a higher average effectiveness (see runs 2
and 5 in Table 6). However the test with a limited dictionary also indicates
that the compound! h! andling process works fairly well.</p>

<p>In order to test the compound handling process further, additional tests
were made (Table 6.). A baseline for German - English bilingual CLIR was
established.</p>

<p>Run 1 in Table 6 is a baseline for German - English CLIR - no compound
splitting or translation of components was performed. The compounds that
could be translated directly using the translation dictionary were used
in a similar way as for any other single word, that is, a synonym structure
for translation alternatives was used.</p>
<p>Run 2 in Table 6 is a test run including the compound processing features
described in Section 4. That is, splitting of compounds into constituents,
normalisation of constituents to base forms, translation using a comprehensive
dictionary and a structured query construction using an unordered proximity
operator and a window size of 5 + n (n = spaces between words in the construction).</p>
<p>Test run 3 in Table 6 includes the best possible translation alternatives
for the compounds in the query. This means that ambiguities in the translations
provided by the dictionary were manually eliminated. It is, however, disambiguation
based solely on the translation of individual compound words in the topic,
not on phrases and multi-word concepts or semantic structures in the topic
sentences.</p>

</table>

<p>Test runs 4 and 5 in Table 6, were performed with the limited dictionary.
Run 4 does not include the compound process and since the dictionary does
not contain any translations for compound words, no compounds were translated
in this run. They are included in the query as such. Test run 5 was performed
using the compound process as described in the case of test run 2.</p>

<p>As expected, the manual disambiguation of compounds, test run 3, performed
well. Likewise, run 4, where compound translation was eliminated by not
including compounds in the dictionary and by not including any compound
handling process, got the lowest score. But surprisingly test run 2, where
the compound process was tested using a comprehensive dictionary was the
most effective, although the difference from test run 3 is very small.
An explanation for this is that the compound process for some queries adds
more weight to the compounds in a query using many alternative translations
and combinations of components. Test runs 1 and 2 allow a comparison for
how well the compound process works as a complement to the comprehensive
dictionary. The result for the run with the process included is clearly
better. This is also true for test runs 4 and 5 where the effect of the
process is compared using a limited dictionary not containing translations
for compounds. The conclusion is! t! hat the compound process is effective
for handling compounds.</p>

<h2>Discussion and conclusion</h2>

<p>The importance of compound processing in dictionary-based cross-language
information retrieval was investigated in this study. We found that around
ten percent of remaining content words in running text are compounds for
the three languages studied. This can be reformulated even more impressively:
it means that more than twenty percent of morphemes in running text are
in compounds! Compounding is a way to form new words and concepts. Compounds
are often occasional. Studying compound processing in cross-language information
retrieval is important, since we know that translation dictionaries, even
comprehensive ones, are limited and cannot hold entries for all compounds.
Compounds and their features are described in this study from the information
retrieval and cross-language information retrieval point of view, and therefore
not all linguistic features for compound formation are considered in this
study. The linguistic reality is much more complex than described here.</p>

<p>The compound handling process is implemented as a component into an
automated cross-language information retrieval system. This makes it possible
to evaluate the final process as well as individual steps in the process
using conventional evaluation measures, the average precision over different
recall levels. The topics and the document database were provided by the
international CLEF evaluation forum, which ensures the availability of
the test material.</p>

<p>The solutions proposed in this study rely on the morphological and syntactic
structure of compounds. For normalisation of compound components the features
of fogemorphemes in Germanic languages, as well as the inflected components
or components in the form of word stems have to be taken into account.
The left- or right-branching structure for the compound components form
the linguistic basis for the novel <i>grouping strategy</i> with pairwise
combination and translation of consecutive components.</p>

<p>The query construction phase has to take into account the features in
the target language. This involves the use of proximity operators and phrase
construction, in this study due to the fact that the target language in
the document database language is English.</p>

<p>The evaluation results of this study indicate that compound processing
as a whole has a clearly positive effect on retrieval results. Each step
in the process has a relatively small impact on the result. However, summing
up each of them adds to the positive effect of the system. One can naturally
discuss whether general conclusions should be drawn on the basis of this
relatively small test sample. Test situations do not completely cover the
complexity of natural language information retrieval, and additional test
sets with different topics and different document databases could yield
other results. In this study the document database contains newspaper text,
which implies that the topics created are adapted to this content. Scientific
articles or other types of texts would use different types of topics and
the concepts and vocabulary would be different.</p>

<p>The relative importance of a system processing compounds for dictionary
based cross-language information retrieval naturally depends on the number
of compounds present in queries as well as the available translation resources.
A direct translation of compounds is clearly more precise and therefore
effective. Using comprehensive dictionaries we are able to directly translate
more compounds than with limited and small translation dictionaries. But
on the other hand, no dictionary can hold entries for all occasional compounds
in a language, so there will always be a need for systems handling compounds
even if their function in some cases is to work as a complement to a direct
translation.</p>

<p>The analysis of compounds and their features from the cross-language
information retrieval point of view in this study could be extended to
semantic analysis to determine, for example, paradigmatic relations and
to syntactic analysis to determine syntactic structures of phrases. This
kind of information could be in use in information retrieval and cross-language
information retrieval applications to determine valuable keys. The descriptions
provided by the morphological analysis program like part of speech, gender,
etc. could also be valuable for disambiguation of translation alternatives.</p>

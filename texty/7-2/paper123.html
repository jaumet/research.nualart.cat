                <h2><a name="Intro"></a>Introduction</h2>

				
                <p><em>Early Canadiana Online/Notre Memoire En Ligne</em> (ECO) is a digital 
                collection of Canadiana<sup><a href="#endnote1">1</a></sup> published 
                before 1900. The collection consists of over 3,000 English and 
                French language books and pamphlets. It is particularly strong 
                in literature, women's history, native studies, travel and exploration, 
                and the history of French Canada. This material is also available 
                in rare book collections in the original paper format and in academic 
                libraries on microfiche. ECO has full text of all material in 
                a searchable ASCII file and provides individual GIF images for 
                each page of an item. ECO was developed by the Canadian Institute 
                for Historical Microreproductions (CIHM) in partnership with Laval 
                University Library, the National Library of Canada and the University 
                of Toronto Library. A grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation 
                and funds from numerous other agencies supported the development 
                of the ECO site. </p>
				
                <p>In April 1999 we conducted a user study of <em>Early Canadiana Online</em>. 
                This study was carried out within the first few months of the 
                site becoming available . The feedback gathered in the study was 
                extremely positive (<a href="#duf00">Duff &amp; Cherry, 2000</a>). However, users identified a number of areas 
                for improvement and, based on these findings, we made 26 recommendations 
                for changes to ECO. Some, but not all, of these changes have been 
                made. We also suggested that a follow-up survey be conducted at 
                a later date. </p>

				
                <p><a name="2ndNote"></a>One year later we conducted the second user 
                survey. Motivation for the second study was threefold. First, 
                we wanted to see if there were any changes in the nature of use, 
                or type of user<sup><a href="#endnote2">2</a></sup>. Second, we 
                wanted to explore the use of ECO in teaching and research. Finally, 
                we wanted to investigate satisfaction levels in more detail and 
                to gather suggestions for further improvements to ECO. </p>
				
				
                <h2>Literature review</h2>
				
                <p>Few studies have evaluated digital library collections from the 
                user’s perspective. The lack of user studies is surprising considering 
                the increasing interest in, and number of, digital library projects. 
                Saracevic and Covi (<a href="#sar00">2000</a>) point out that &quot;a great many things are 
                being done and explored, but evaluation is conspicuous by it absence 
                in the majority of published work on digital libraries, be it 
                research or practice&quot; (p. 341). </p>
				
                <p>The majority of digital library projects funded under the auspices 
                of the Digital Library Initiative (DLI) have included research 
                on the use of these collections. The studies have tended to take 
                a fairly broad approach, using a variety of research methods including 
                surveys, participant observation, usability testing, ethnographic 
                studies, focus groups and transaction log analysis (<a href="#bis99">Bishop, 1999</a>; <a href="#bis00">Bishop <em>et al.</em>, 2000</a>; <a href="#but99">Buttenfield, 1999</a>; <a href="#hil00">Hill <em>et al</em>., 2000</a>) . Neuman and 
                Bishop (<a href="#neu00">2000</a>) suggest that different methods of data collection or triangulation 
                are crucial for one to obtain a holistic picture of the use of 
                digital libraries. </p>

				
                <p>Previous research suggests that the development of a good interface 
                requires knowledge of how the collections will be used and the 
                types of tasks the digital library supports (<a href="#bis99">Bishop, 1999</a>).  The variety of tasks 
                carried out by various communities often leads to different expectation 
                of the system . The usefulness of a digital library depends on 
                the existing beliefs of the users and their previous experience (<a href="#bis00">Bishop 
<em>et al.</em>, 2000</a>)
                as well as the socio-technical environment in which the libraries 
                are implemented (<a href="#kil98">Kilker &amp; Gay, 1998</a>). </p>
				
				<h2><a name="resdes"></a>Research design </h2>
				
                <p>This study used a single method of data collection to gather information 
                about the use of one digital collection. It employed a <a href="p123qre.html">web-based 
                questionnaire</a>.  We used Perseus <i><a href="http://www.perseusdevelopment.com/" target="_blank"> Survey Solutions</a></i> software 
                to design the instrument and to administer the survey. </p>

	
                <h3>Design and testing of the questionnaire</h3> 
				
                <p>The online questionnaire had 26 questions, grouped into five sections: 
                (1) questions about the person's use of Early Canadiana materials 
                in general; (2) detailed questions about how the person used an 
                item from <em>Early Canadiana Online</em> in the current session; (3) use 
                of the <em>Early Canadiana Online</em> web site as a whole; (4) use of 
                <em>Early Canadiana Online</em> in teaching and scholarly research (if 
                this did not apply, the user skipped to the next section); and 
                (5) general questions about the person's use of computers and 
                the Internet, and demographics. The questionnaire was available 
                in English and French. </p>
				
                <p>The questionnaire used in the first study included questions about 
                use of Early Canadiana materials in original paper and microfiche 
                formats in addition to the World Wide Web (WWW) format. In the 
                second study we focussed on the WWW format only. Based on the 
                responses to the first study, we clarified some of the wording 
                and modified the choices available for some questions. We added 
                a section on the use of ECO for two tasks (i.e., teaching and 
                scholarly research) and another section on the use of the ECO 
                web site as a whole which included satisfaction ratings for six 
                features of the site. Finally, in the demographic section we added 
                questions related to the size of the communities in which the 
                respondents lived and their country of residence. </p>

				
                <p>We pre-tested the revised questionnaire with five people and made 
                minor changes in wording to four questions and dropped one of 
                the choices in two questions.</p> 
				
                <h3>Data collection</h3>
				
                <p>The questionnaire was available on the ECO web site from May 19, 
                2000 to June 12, 2000. Respondents in the survey were offered 
                an entry for a draw with a chance to win one of five $100 cash 
                prizes.</p> 
				
                <h3>Data analysis</h3> 
				
                <p>The response set from each user arrived as an email message. The 
                email messages were uploaded to an Access database through <i>Survey 
                Solutions</i>. A preliminary report of the data was generated 
                through <i>Survey Solutions. </i>The data set was exported to 
                SPSS 10.0 for more detailed analysis.</p> 
				
             <h2> Findings </h2>

				
                <p>We present our findings in the context of the research questions 
                which guided the collection and analysis of the data. The research 
                questions were: </p>
				
                <ul><li> Has the user group or the nature of use of ECO changed since the first user survey?</li> 
                <li>How is ECO being used in teaching and research?</li>
					  <li>How satisfied are users with features of ECO, and how can these features be improved?</li></ul>
                    
                <h3>User group and nature of use of ECO</h3> 
				
                <h4>User group</h4><a name="3rdNote"></a> 
				
                <p>One hundred and fifty-nine people responded to the user survey<sup><a href="#endnote3">3</a></sup>. 
                Of the 159 respondents, 83% completed an English questionnaire 
                and 17% completed a French questionnaire. Table 1 shows the profile 
                of respondents in terms of gender, age, and area of interest. </p>

                </table>

                
               <p> Over half of the respondents were women (59%). In terms of age, 
                over half of the respondents were forty or over (62%); 30% were 
                in the age group 25-39; and 8% were under 25. In terms of primary 
                area of interest, the two largest groups were history (33%) and 
                genealogy (29%), followed by native studies (8%) and Canadian 
                studies (7%). </p>
				
                <p>The majority of respondents lived in Canada (72%); 22% lived in 
                the United States. The majority lived in medium-sized cities or 
                large metropolitan centres (75%). The majority of respondents 
                (69%) were accessing the ECO site from a computer at home, while 
                23% were using a computer at work. The respondents were experienced 
                Internet users with 79% having used the Internet for more than 
                two years; 50% used the Internet 11 or more hours per week; 48% 
                rated their knowledge of the Internet as excellent, while 42% 
                rated their knowledge as fair. </p>
				
               <p>Half of the respondents were regular users of Early Canadiana 
                materials in some format with 29% reporting that they used the 
                materials monthly, 18% weekly, and 3% daily. On the other hand, 
                14% used Early Canadiana materials rarely, and over one-third 
                (36%) were first time users. It appears that these first time 
                users had been introduced to Early Canadiana materials though 
                the WWW. Figure 1 shows how frequently respondents used Early 
                Canadiana materials in any format (original paper, microfiche, 
                or WWW). </p>

               <h4> Nature of use of ECO</h4> 
			   
                <p>We explored the nature of use in terms of how people use ECO documents 
                and how they used the ECO site in general. </p>
				
                <p>One section of the questionnaire focussed on how the respondent 
                used an item from <em>Early Canadiana Online</em> in the current session. 
                The questionnaire asked how users found the item, their reason 
                for using the item, how they used it, the parts of the item they 
                used, whether they printed any portion of the item, and whether 
                they would need to consult the original paper or microfiche format 
                of the item.</p>
				
                <p>Figure 2 shows how respondents found the Early Canadiana item. 
                Almost three-quarters of the respondents found the item by using 
                the ECO search function; 10% percent followed a link from another 
                site; and 9% had used the item before and bookmarked it.</p> 
				
               
				<div align="center"><img border="0" src="p123fig2.gif" width="542" height="255" align="absbottom" ></div> 
                 <div align="center"><br><strong>Figure 2. How respondents found the item used in the current session 
                (n=134)</strong></div> 
				
                <p>Approximately half (51%) were using the item for personal interest/hobby 
                or genealogy. Twenty-one percent were using the item for scholarly 
                research, 12% for professional purposes, and 6% for teaching. 
                Only 5% read the entire item online; 29% read parts of the item 
                online, while 30% read some of the item online and printed some, 
                or all, of the item. </p>

				
                <p>Over half (59%) of the respondents reported using the table of 
                contents; almost one-third (31%) used the introduction; and about 
                one-quarter (24%) used the index. Illustrations, graphs, tables/data, 
                and citations were each used by slightly less than 20% of users. 
                Less than ten percent (9%) of the respondents used the conclusion 
                of the document. It is important to note that the collection contains 
                many pamphlets and works of fiction and therefore many of the 
                items used may not have contained some of these features. Almost 
                half (49%) of the respondents printed some part of the item. For 
                many (35%), this amounted to only a few pages. Well over three-quarters 
                (82%) of respondents reported that they would not need to consult 
                either the original paper or the microfiche format of the item 
                just used. One user commented, &quot;having access to facsimiles 
                [sic] of each page obviates the necessity of consulting the original 
                paper source.&quot;</p>
				
                <p>Another section of the questionnaire focussed on the use of the 
                Early Canadian Online site in general. It gathered information 
                about how the respondents learned about the ECO site; how often 
                they visited the site; how much time they had spent on the site 
                on that day; and how satisfied they were with specific features. 
                In addition, it asked how ECO might affect their work, research, 
                education, and leisure activities.</p> 
				
                <p>Almost half (49%) of the respondents first learned about the Early 
                Canadiana Online site by surfing the WWW. Eighteen percent learned 
                about the site from an email discussion list or newsgroup, and 
                15% had a personal referral. Of the remainder, 9% learned about 
                the site from a publication, 5% from promotional material, and 
                4% from other sources (Figure 3).</p>

                <p>Almost half of the respondents are regular users of the site (monthly, 
                weekly, or daily use). 17% of the respondents spent more than 
                an hour on the site in the current session.</p>

				
				
               <h4> How is ECO being used in teaching and research?</h4> 
				
                <p>A section of the questionnaire asked about use of Early Canadiana 
                Online in teaching and scholarly research. If this did not apply, 
                the user skipped to the next section. Sixty-two people responded 
                to this section. As shown in Table 2, 38 respondents used ECO 
                in their research; 24 respondents recommended ECO as a resource 
                for students; 19 used ECO as a resource for their thesis or dissertation; 
                12 used page images from ECO in presentations and talks; and 11 
                used ECO to develop course material. </p>

                <p>For teachers and researchers at institutions with small libraries 
                ECO provides the means to do research or offer courses which require 
                Early Canadiana materials. For example, one respondent stated, 
                &quot;I am at a university with a limited budget for microfilm 
                acquisition, never mind the original documents. I might not be 
                able to do specialist research from this university, were it not 
                for the version of early canadiana online [sic] from the WWW database.&quot; 
                A teacher commented that &quot; it [ECO] will provide me with 
                an additional place to search for Canadian content for my courses--i 
                teach ata [sic] small community college so the importance of resources 
                such as yours which supplement our relatively small library are 
                invaluable to ourselves and to our students--and we are grateful 
                for them…&quot;. ECO also provides source material for Canadian 
                Studies courses taught outside Canada. &quot;Being a Canadian 
                who works in the United States, it's another search opportunity 
                and another source to direct students to for class assignments 
                and research.&quot; </p>

				
                <p>ECO gathers source materials together and makes them available 
                to users regardless of location. A researcher commented on the 
                gathering function, &quot;It will allow me to more easily pursue 
                my research in material on my topic that is located all over the 
                place, and usually difficult to access (rare book rooms with limited 
                hours). It will also make it easier to share ‘finds’ and discuss 
                with colleagues.&quot; One person commented on location in terms 
                of convenience, &quot;I can find things instantly, from my office. 
                This is useful when I'm preparing lectures or advising students. 
                Also, my students find it more interesting to access material 
                on-line than on microfiche.&quot; Another commented on location 
                in terms of geography, &quot;ECO will allow me to continue my 
                doctoral research next year even though I will be living in the 
                UK where sources for 17C Canadian history are not readily available.&quot;</p> 
                
                <p>ECO facilitates discovery of new resources. As one graduate student 
                stated, &quot;It has been a fantastic resource for my Master's 
                thesis research - I have found articles here I didn't even know 
                existed. The search capabilities allow me to find information 
                in sources I may otherwise have overlooked.&quot; ECO also helps 
                users retrieve relevant information from material that has not 
                been indexed. One respondent stated, &quot;The capacity to key 
                word search document speeds up the process of searching through 
                books without indexes; prior to this I've had to scan page-by-page 
                19th-century titles.&quot;</p>
				
                <p>Another question asked what would make ECO a more useful resource 
                for teaching or research. In response, one person suggested links 
                to &quot;information about the texts and their authors&quot;. 
                Another suggested that ECO provide access to the collection by 
                genre, e.g., novels and poetry. Two respondents suggested that 
                ECO include non-textual materials (e.g., illustrations). Several 
                commented on aspects of the print function, with one suggesting 
                &quot;a print-on-demand, just-in-time delivery service at a reasonable 
                cost. This should be partnered with one of the new e-publishing 
                houses such as Trafford.&quot; </p>

				
                <p>To explore how the tasks of teaching and research affect the use 
                of ECO we compared the responses provided by those who used ECO 
                for teaching or research with data from other users. We found 
                significant differences in two areas: one related to participants' 
                use of an item; the other related to the ECO site. In terms of 
                use of an item, although only nine percent of respondents used 
                the conclusion of the item, three-quarters of these respondents 
                (9 of 12) used ECO for teaching and research. One question asked 
                respondents, &quot;Now that you have used this item in the World 
                Wide Web format, will you need to consult it in the original paper 
                or microfiche format?&quot; There were three choices: Original 
                paper, Microfiche, or Neither. Significantly fewer respondents 
                who used ECO for teaching and research chose Neither (chi-sq = 
                3.904, df = 1, p = .048). </p>
				
                <p>In terms of the ECO site, we found significant differences in 
                how people learned about the ECO site, how frequently they used 
                the site, and how satisfied they were with the ECO search function. 
                Of those who used ECO for teaching and research, more than expected 
                found out about the site by personal referral. Of the remaining 
                respondents, more than expected found out about the site by surfing 
                the WWW or an email discussion list (chi-sq = 21.190, df = 5, 
                p = .001). Of those who used ECO for teaching and research, more 
                than expected used the site on a frequent basis, i.e., monthly, 
                weekly or daily (chi-sq = 21.321, df = 4, p &lt; .001). Finally, 
                although the levels of satisfaction with ECO features were high 
                overall (as discussed in the next section), of those respondents 
                who used ECO for teaching and research, more than expected were 
                &quot;Dissatisfied&quot; or &quot;Very Dissatisfied&quot; with 
                the ECO search function (chi-sq = 9.039, df = 3, p = .029). 
				
                <h4>How satisfied are users with features of ECO, and how can these 
                features be improved?</h4>

				
                <p>Overall, users were satisfied with features of Early Canadiana 
                Online. The survey asked users to indicate how satisfied they 
                were with response time, browse capabilities, comprehensiveness 
                of the collection, print function, search capabilities, and display 
                of document pages. Over 90% of the respondents indicated that 
                they were <i>Very Satisfied</i> or <i>Satisfied</i> with five 
                of the six features.</p>
				
                <p>For the sixth feature, the print function, 85% were <i>Very Satisfied</i> 
                or <i>Satisfied</i>. Of the 57 respondents providing comments 
                about the features, 15 people commented on the print function. 
                People complained that printing was &quot;very slow and cumbersome&quot;, 
                &quot;painfully slow&quot;, and that they wished to download or 
                print multiple pages or the entire document. For example, one 
                respondent commented that &quot;when printing out a whole work 
                it is very slow to do so page by page. It would be very useful 
                to be able to download one whole work at once.&quot; Another stated, 
                &quot;To print a page at a time is very time consuming, especially 
                when you want the PDF version. It would be nice if it were available 
                in larger ‘chunks’.&quot; Two people said that they would like 
                to be able to print the page without extraneous information such 
                as headers and search criteria. ECO provides an option to view 
                and print a PDF version of each page image (i.e., without any 
                extraneous information) however it seems that some users are not 
                aware of this option. The print function was also a focus of serious 
                concern for respondents in the first survey. The recommendation 
                which we rated as highest priority was that ECO should support 
                printing of an entire document or multiple pages of a document. 
                However, this recommendation has not yet been acted upon. Obviously 
                the problems persist.</p>

				
                <p>Some respondents commented on the navigability of the site, requesting 
                the creation of links from the Table of Contents and back to the 
                Table of Contents. For example, &quot;Having a hyper-linked Table 
                of Contents would be very helpful&quot;, and &quot;I would like 
                to see an option button at the bottom of every text page which 
                allows me to return to the Table of Contents page for that document.&quot; </p>
                
                <p>Many respondents expressed support for expanding the database, 
                e.g., &quot;I hope you are continuing to add more resources – 
                the concept of <em>Early Canadiana Online</em> is excellent.&quot; Some 
                respondents made specific suggestions for additions, e.g., &quot;more 
                regional resources to balance what is already in place&quot;, 
                &quot;more on Loyalists and the settlement of Upper Canada&quot;, 
                and &quot;more social history, settlement history&quot;. Some 
                even recommended specific periodicals to add to the site, e.g., 
                <i>Canadian Magazine</i> and the <i>Bystander</i>, and the addition 
                of archival records such as the employee records of the Grand 
                Trunk Company. Many respondents in the first survey made similar 
                comments. </p>

				
                <p>We asked users to comment on what they liked best about Early 
                Canadiana Online. Most frequently mentioned themes were accessibility, 
                searchability, and appreciation of the scanned images.</p>
				
                <p>ECO provides ready access to materials that are otherwise difficult 
                for some users to access because of distance and the restrictions 
                of rare book collections. For example, one user liked, &quot;Being 
                able to read portions of these documents online, without having 
                to go to the library, without having to read microfiche, without 
                having to order and wait for receipt of items through interlibrary 
                loan.&quot; Another user associated the improved access with saving 
                time and money, &quot;I like the fact that I am able to access 
                material that has been previously available on[ly] in places such 
                as the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library. This cuts down on both 
                research time and expenses.&quot; Many users explicitly commented 
                on the Canadian content. For example, &quot;Provides good access 
                to historical materials on Canada that are not available otherwise&quot; 
                and &quot;Excellent selection of first hand accounts of life in 
                early Canada.&quot;</p> 
				
                <p>ECO provides full-text search on OCR text and many respondents 
                commented on the search capability of the system. &quot;The search 
                service acts (miraculously) as a gigantic index to 3000 printed 
                volumes. This is a major advance for historical researchers.&quot;</p> 
                
                <p>Users indicated that they liked the scanned images because using 
                them is similar to using the original material. One user stated, 
                &quot;I love to look at the real pages for it is just like reading 
                the original book. Having the picture of the whole book page by 
                page is really fascinating.&quot; Another commented, &quot;seeing 
                original documents makes history ‘come alive’.&quot; Other users 
                liked ECO because it provided &quot;untampered source material&quot;. </p>

                
                <p>The comments from the survey also revealed some unanticipated 
                uses of the ECO collection, e.g., a toponymist uses ECO to pinpoint 
                the date and origin of place names; one person uses ECO to help 
                learn his native language; and another uses ECO as a source of 
                knitting and crocheting patterns. These users may be some of the 
                people who have been introduced to Early Canadiana through the 
                WWW. </p>
				
                <h2>Discussion </h2>
				
                <p>Overall, the findings from the second user survey parallel those 
                of the first survey (<a href="#duf00">Duff &amp; Cherry, 2000</a>). The profiles of the respondents in the two 
                surveys are remarkably similar except in the following areas. 
                Fewer people completed a French questionnaire (17% in the second 
                survey vs 26% in the first survey); there was a higher percentage 
                of female respondents (59% in the second survey vs 47% in the 
                first survey); and respondents were slightly less heavy users 
                of the Internet (30% of respondents in the second survey used 
                the Internet more than 15 hours per week compared to 46% in the 
                first survey). </p>
				
                <p>As in the first survey, we found that users continue to use the 
                traditional methods to access the content of an item. For example, 
                an increasing percentage of respondents reported use of the table 
                of contents (59% in the second survey vs 26% in the first survey) 
                and the index (24% in the second survey vs 17% in the first survey). 
                In the second survey, a larger percentage of respondents reported 
                that they printed some part of the item (49% in the second survey 
                vs 30% in the first survey).</p>
				
                <p>In the second survey we explored a new area, the use of ECO in 
                teaching and research. The findings indicate that ECO can give 
                teachers and students with limited budgets or at institutions 
                with limited budgets access to rare, highly valued research material. 
                The findings also reveal how respondents who use ECO for teaching 
                and research differ from other respondents in how they used an 
                item, how they learned about the ECO site, how frequently they 
                used the site, and how satisfied they were with the ECO search 
                function. These differences may be a result of the types of tasks 
                they carry out or the culture of teaching and research.</p>

				
                <p>In both surveys, users were very satisfied with ECO and very enthusiastic 
                about it. They pointed out that ECO overcomes barriers of rare 
                book libraries with limited hours and faulty or cumbersome microfiche 
                equipment. Academics at small institutions noted that ECO provides 
                valuable resources for Canadian history which their libraries, 
                with limited budgets, could not afford. Other respondents noted 
                the advantages of a single access point to materials that are 
                held in rare book libraries across Canada and the advantages of 
                ECO’s full-text search function which enables them to search the 
                content of historical materials that are not indexed.</p>
				
                <p>Our overall assessment based on the findings of the second user 
                survey is that ECO is well received and has a great potential 
                to attract new users and increase appreciation of Early Canadiana 
                materials. However, despite the enthusiasm for ECO, some problems 
                identified in the first user survey were noted again. For example, 
                users continue to complain about the print function which does 
                not allow printing of multiple pages or the entire document. Similarly, 
                some enhancements suggested in the first survey were requested 
                again in the second survey, e.g., the creation of links from the 
                table of contents to the text of a document. </p>
				
                <h2>Implications for digital libraries </h2>
				
               <p> The study reported here addresses the use of one digital collection. 
                However, its findings are relevant to research on the use of digital 
                libraries in general. The findings suggest that digital library 
                research should take into account the types of tasks carried out, 
                as well as the culture, of different user groups. Furthermore, 
                digital libraries of historical materials have the potential to 
                attract new user groups who will use the collection to support 
                unexpected tasks. The findings also indicate that it is important 
                to study the use of digital library collections over time to reveal 
                changes in both the users and their uses. Web-based surveys provide 
                an efficient and effective way to gather such data. These surveys 
                can be conducted on a regular basis (e.g., annually) or to gather 
                feedback when changes are made to the collection or site. Comparing 
                survey data across time and triangulating survey data with other 
                sources of data (e.g., logs, interviews) will provide us with 
                a more complete understanding of the use of digital libraries. 
                Only with this fuller understanding will we be able to develop 
                integrated digital environments for scholars, and assess how such 
                environments might affect the scholarly process.</p>

                <p><a name="endnote2">2&nbsp; </a>First, the original survey 
                covered a time period when publicity for the <em>Early Canadiana Online</em> 
                site was heavy. We felt that this publicity might have affected 
                the volume of use, the nature of use, and the type of users. The 
                second survey was conducted one year later during a more typical 
                period (i.e., publicity regarding the launch of ECO was over, 
                and consequently there might be fewer users who were simply curious 
                about the site).<br>

                <p><a name="endnote3">3&nbsp; </a>We are unable to determine 
                how representative the respondents in this survey are of the population 
                of ECO users. The number of respondents is small compared to the 
                number of hits that ECO receives, however we have no way of determining 
                who uses ECO, or how often they visit the site. We note, though, 
                that the number and types of respondents in this survey are similar 
                to the respondents in the previous study.<br>

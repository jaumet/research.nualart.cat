<h2>Reijo's initial <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the review </h2>

<p>Tom has written a thoughtful review about my book entitled Everyday Information Practices: <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>Phenomenological</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Perspective (Scarecrow Press, 2008). In particular, he <span>raises</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>well-founded questions about the conceptual and <span>terminological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>issues regarding the relationship between information behaviour and information practice. </p> 

<p>As Chapter 2 of my book suggests, the <span>exact</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>definition of the concepts of behaviour, <span>action</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> activity and practice is very difficult, due to their generic nature. Hence, no wonder that there is no consensus among philosophers, psychologists and sociologists about how to specify them. Probably, these terms will remain semantically open in the <span>future</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> too. This will not make it easier for us how to select and justify &quot;umbrella terms&quot; such as information behaviour/ human information behaviour and information practice. </p>

<p>One of the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>critical points in the book review <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the &quot;straw man&quot; argument by which I prefer &quot;practice&quot; to &quot;behaviour&quot;. In this context, Tom comments on the &quot;straw man&quot; argument concerning behaviourism. While characterizing behaviourism, I drew on <span>George</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Graham's article published in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. I found it easy to <span>agree</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with Graham in that the behaviourist approach seems to hopelessly restrictive.</p>  

<p>Since &quot;behaviourism&quot; seems to be a &quot;dead horse&quot; in the pychological discourse, I do not <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the limitations of behaviourism to undermine the credibility of the concept of &quot;information behaviour&quot;. As Tom rightly points out, Schutz criticized behaviourism but employed the concept of &quot;behaviour&quot; in a broad sense. In my view, Schutz's way to approach the concept of behaviour comes close to Tom's definition: &quot;'Human behaviour'... is about how people act in the world, and it is well <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that a <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>s actions have both <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and social dimensions&quot;.  </p>

<p>Further, while commenting on the stimulus – <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>mechanism</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Tom <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to a quotation taken out from page 142 of my book: &quot;Overall, the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>confirm the results of earlier studies suggesting that health and consumption related issues tend to trigger most processes of problem-specific information seeking in everyday contexts&quot;. However, I would like to understand the &quot;triggers&quot; here more broadly, not merely as stimuli since this view reminds us of the behaviourist approach. For example, consumption issues (as triggers of information seeking) are not reducible to immediate stimuli experienced and reacted to in the supermarket. The triggering factors may also incorporate <span>values</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> interests and norms that orient habitual ways to prefer individual products, for example.</p> 

<p>Thus, it seems to me that in the book review, the role given to the &quot;straw man&quot; argument related to behaviourism is more <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>than it may deserve. Overall, I'm less interested in refuting &quot;information behaviour&quot; by drawing on arguments such as the limitations of behaviourism. The gist of my critical notions is that so far we <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>detailed discussion about how to define &quot;behaviour&quot; in the context of seeking, retrieving, using, sharing, organizing and managing of information. However, my <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>interest lies in the positive <span>characterization</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>composed of specific information actions. Therefore, I would not define information practice as &quot;a <span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of behaviour&quot; as Tom suggests ; -) Information practice may be <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in its own right, as summarized in the model of everyday information <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> presented on page 65 of my book. </p>

<p>However, Tom's questions about how to relate &quot;habituated behaviour&quot; and &quot;information practice&quot; and how <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information behaviour become habituated and why, are highly relevant. Interestingly, we face here the question about &quot;action&quot; because it seems to be a constituent of behaviour and as well as practice. Tom wrote: &quot;'Human behaviour' on the other hand, is pretty unequivocal: it is about how people act in the world, and it is well <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that a <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>s actions have both <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and social dimensions&quot;. If we replace &quot;human behaviour&quot; with &quot;information practice&quot;, the end result might be quite same, at least in the <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>world of everyday life. </p>

<p>Tom illuminates the nature of habituated behaviour by <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>an example of a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>calling in on the newsagent for his copy of The Times. In the light of this example Tom wonders why &quot;the author does not address this <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>chapters and I suspect that this is because instances of information behaviour of various <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>play such a small part in the everyday world of the individual that there is little occasion for how they are performed to become habituated&quot;. Again, this is a good point. On the other hand, my book <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>examples of habituated information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>such as the deeply ingrained habit to read morning newspaper while having breakfast (p. 102). Tom is right in that I have not explored how such ways to seek information became habituated (unfortunately, my <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>data were insufficient for this purpose since I concentrated on current habits). Overall, Tom's idea that practice may be defined as &quot;habituated behaviour&quot; captures very well the fact that  <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are constituted by relatively <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and sometimes even routine actions. However, as I <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in Fig. 3.3. (p. 65), <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>may also incorporate non-routine elements (actions). Practices are not not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>composed of  frozen habits since habituated actions evolve, too. From this <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> defining practice as habituated behaviour may narrow its meaning.</p> 

<p>All in all, Tom's review captures very well the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>points of my book. I learned a lot while scrutinizing the review. We define and <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot;umbrella concepts&quot; somewhat differently but this may enrich discussion in our field and keep it alive. Information behaviour and information practice are closely related. They incorporate common elements such as &quot;action&quot; but still they are not reducible to each other. Behaviour draws more <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the tradition of <span>psychology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(or social psychology) while the conceptualizations of practice draw more on sociology (Bourdieu, Giddens) and social philosophy (Schutz, Schatzki, Wittgenstein). From this <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> information behaviour and information practice complement each other. </p>

<p>To clarify the meaning of key concepts, it is important to continue the analysis of conceptual issues by scrutinizing how information behaviour and information practice are related and how they may be <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as diverse (complementary) aspects of a common <span>phenomenon</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Given the myriad of <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to behaviour and practice in <span>psychology</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> sociology and philosophy, I'm somewhat sceptical about the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to find a <span>rigorous</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>definition of these concepts. Probably, this state of affairs will be reflected in the attempts to define information behaviour and information practice as well. <span>Nevertheless</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> we should go on, step by step to explore these exciting concepts and try to identify their similarities and differences. Apparently, such endeavour would help us to clarify the self-portrait of information research, too.</p>

<p>Reijo's <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is helpful in <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the debate on and we begin to converge, I think.  However, there are one or two places where I think that further clarification is necessary.  First, Reijo notes, &quot;<span style="font-style:italic;";>the <span>exact</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>definition of the concepts of behaviour, <span>action</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> activity and practice is very difficult, due to their generic nature.</span>&quot;  However, to my understanding, these concepts are not generic.  The generic concept is behaviour – hence, for example, the 'behavioural sciences' – we do not <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the 'action sciences' or the 'practice sciences': the others are elements of behaviour – actions, activities – or a <span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of behaviour – practice.  Our behaviour in the world is composed of <span>cognitive</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> physical and social activities, which, in terms of activity theory, are composed of actions.  The <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of consensus to which Reijo <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>seems to me to have more to do with ideological differences, fads and fashions, to which the human and social sciences are prone, rather than because of any <span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>semantic problems.</p>

<p>Reijo also notes, &quot;<span style="font-style:italic;";>I do not <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the limitations of behaviourism to undermine the credibility of the concept of 'information behaviour;</span>&quot;, but, in his book, it is these limitations that are put forward as the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>reason for rejecting the concept of behaviour in favour of practice.  The section on pages 21 to 23 is concerned <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with this argument, and my point was that this is a rather laboured argument because behaviourism does not have the strength of support it did in, say, the 1950s.</p>

<p>In referring to my comment about &quot;triggers&quot;, when I draw <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the pervasive nature of behaviourist ideas, Reijo comments: &quot;<span style="font-style:italic;";>However, I would like to understand the &quot;triggers&quot; here more broadly, not merely as stimuli since this view reminds us of the behaviourist approach. For example, consumption issues (as triggers of information seeking) are not reducible to immediate stimuli experienced and reacted to in the supermarket. The triggering factors may also incorporate <span>values</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> interests and norms that orient habitual ways to prefer individual products, for example</span>.&quot;  There is a problem here:  I am no behaviourist (in spite of the fact that some commentators (not Reijo) appear to align me with that school) but &quot;stimulus&quot; is much more widely <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>within behaviourism than Reijo suggests.  For example, within behaviourist learning theory, <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and social norms, play a key role – there is no suggestion within behaviourism that the individual is some kind of isolated organism, unaffected by the surrounding society.  Rather, it is <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that learning is a social process as much as it is a <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>process.  What Reijo calls &quot;triggering factors&quot; would be <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in behaviourism as stimuli and <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and other elements would be <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to be part of those stimuli.  However, I drew <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the statement, to point out that, whatever <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>position vis-à-vis behaviourism, the fact is that the concepts have become deeply embedded in our discourse. </p>

<p>Again, Rejio comments, &quot;<span style="font-style:italic;";>Behaviour draws more <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the tradition of <span>psychology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(or social psychology) while the conceptualizations of practice draw more on sociology (Bourdieu, Giddens) and social philosophy (Schutz, Schatzki, Wittgenstein). From this <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> information behaviour and information practice complement each other.</span>&quot;  This may be the opinion of the practice <span>theorists</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>mentioned by the Reijo in his text, but I think it would be rejected by many sociologists, political scientists and social anthropologists today, who do not <span>limit</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>their understanding of 'behaviour' to the <span>psychological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>use of the <span>term</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> The sociological literature is full of references to behaviour, without <span>limiting</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the concept to a <span>psychological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>context.  Indeed, sociology could not study social behaviour as a <span>purely</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>psychological <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>without being charged with reductionism. This leads me to the belief that the practice <span>theorists</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves are <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>up the straw man argument, simply to bolster their own <span>positions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>– and, given the era in which practice theory emerged (Bourdieu's Outline of a theory of practice was published in 1972), it was, perhaps, understandable, since Bourdieu, Schutz, Schatzki and others were reacting against what had been until then, a prevailing orthodoxy.</p>

<p>The <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that practice <span>theorists</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>have is that by deliberately opposing the concept of behaviour, they lose all <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of developing a distinctive, coherent theory. As Reijo notes, practice theory has its own problems of confusing and conflicting <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and, rather than clarifying, its application appears to further confuse.  Quite significant differences exist among the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>protagonists of practice theory – perhaps Bourdieu can be credited with its <span>invention</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and he <span>wrote</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of social <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and from his early work on a theory of practice derived his possibly better-known concepts of habitus and social capital.  Giddens also sees society as being the result of structured <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> while both Bourdieu and Foucault are also interested in the embodiment of practice – that is, how the body is used in the <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of a practice and how the practice shapes the use of the body.  Needless to say, there are other practice <span>theorists</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>who would <span>hold</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>different views of what 'practice' may be.</p>

<p>This leaves us with a problem – if we are to adopt 'practice' in place of 'behaviour' – which theory of practice will we use, and how will we use it to explore what I call 'information behaviour?  We cannot tell this from Reijo's work at this stage of its development, since his <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>work was conducted within the <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of phenomenological sociology – a <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>I'm very happy to see – and use of the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>'practice' does not seem to perform any analytical purpose. As Reijo notes, his results provide further support for previous work – virtually all of which was carried out as explorations of information behaviour.</p> 

<p>Reijo concludes that, &quot;<span style="font-style:italic;";>To clarify the meaning of key concepts, it is important to continue the analysis of conceptual issues by scrutinizing how information behaviour and information practice are related and how they may be <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as diverse (complementary) aspects of a common <span>phenomenon</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></span>&quot;  Clearly, I have ideas on how that might be <span>achieved</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>  However, although I would conceive of the concepts as related, I would not see them as aspects of a common <span>phenomenon</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>In my understanding the common <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is human behaviour, which is composed of <span>cognitive</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> physical and social actions, which constitute activities.  For example, &quot;information searching&quot; is an activity which includes a variety of actions to accomplish the task or operation – actions such as logging on to a <span>computer</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> launching a Web browser, entering a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and so on. Before the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the Web, the actions would have been different: visiting the library, locating an abstracting journal, searching the subject index, noting item numbers on paper, searching for those item numbers, recording potentially relevant items, and so on.   Bourdieu sees things similarly when he talks of the '<span style="font-style:italic;";>elementary <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of behaviour... in the unity of an organized activity</span>'. In fact, examining some <span>representations</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of practice theory, there is a very close resemblance to activity theory.  Of course, Bourdieu could not acknowledge this as he was presenting an anti-Marxist view of relationships in society.</p>

<p>I would define a practice, on the other hand, as a customary activity and, in Bourdieu and others this formulation is <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to socially determined and/or socially sanctioned activities – where the social aspect may be explicit (as in legally sanctioned activity) or implicit, as in social mores.</p>

<p>In other writings on practice theory, <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are seen as characteristic routines and habits.  I would associate routines with work tasks, and habits with personally constructed behaviour. On this definition, work <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>would be associated with routines and everyday <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with habits.</p>

<p>Reijo notes: &quot;<span style="font-style:italic;";>However, as I <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in Fig. 3.3. (p. 65), <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>may also incorporate non-routine elements (actions). Practices are not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>composed of frozen habits since habituated actions evolve, too. From this <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> defining practice as habituated behaviour may narrow its meaning.</span>&quot;</p>

<p>I do not see this as a significant issue: like all aspects of human behaviour routines and habits are malleable, the adoption of the terms does not imply that the actions incorporated are never subject to change. Circumstances alter cases, as the saying goes and there are many City of London bankers and traders whose eating and drinking 'habits' will have changed significantly in recent months.</p>

<p>With this model there is no opposition of practice and behaviour:  behaviour is the totality of human activity in society, while, on the individual level, <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are aggregations of routines and/or habits towards the accomplishment of some goal.  <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> on the other hand are discussed in terms of how the structures of society result from practice. If we wish to incorporate the notion of social determination or sanction, we are <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>looking at a higher level of aggregation with the aim of understanding how our relationships with information are constructed in society and what role they play in society.  Some practice theory at this level is concerned with power distributions and there might be fruitful areas to explore in the relationship of information and power.</p>

<p>It will be obvious that I do not view behaviour and practice as being in opposition, but neither do I view them as having equal theoretical <span>status</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> If we are to use practice as an analytical concept we need to define it rigorously – not for all time, of course, but at least for the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of any given <span>investigation</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>  If we wish to emphasise the social dimension of practice, it would give <span>rise</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to different questions than if we chose to explore routines or habits and, as I hinted in my review, by introducing practice as an analytical concept we can begin to ask interesting questions, such as: How does habitual behaviour in respect of information develop? What role does information play in the development of work routines?  How do changes in habitual information seeking occur?  And so on.  However, those questions cannot <span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>if we simply propose that the word practice should replace the word behaviour in our discourse.</p>

<p>I shall now give Reijo the last word: we publicized the discussion in the hope that others might join in and comment.  That appears to have been a vain hope, but I imagine that someone is making a note of the URL for <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in a paper!</p>

<h2>Reijo's reply</h2>

<p>Tom's reply to my comment is very sophisticated and it elaborates well the complex relationships between behaviour and practice, as well as their <span>constituents</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Given the complexity of these issues, my comment below should not be seen as &quot;a final word&quot; about this theme. I hope that our dialogue will serve as an <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to a broader discussion about the key concepts used in our field.</p>  

<p>As our dialogue indicates, we emphasize the need to clarify the meaning of the concepts of information behaviour and information practice. Studies focusing on the definition of the above concepts would scrutinize their <span>semantic</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>similarities and differences. <span>Conceptual</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>analyses are helpful in that they can <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>how the concepts overlap or converge, for example. </p> 

<p>On the other hand, <span>purely</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>semantic <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or the scrutiny of <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>may not lead us very far, after all. Therefore, it is equally important to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the discursive nature of  concepts by investigating their <span>origin</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and legitimacy. I have discussed this <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in more detail in an article entitled &quot;<span style="font-style:italic;";>Information behaviour and information practice: reviewing the 'umbrella concepts' of information-seeking studies</span>&quot; (<span style="font-style:italic;";>Library Quarterly</span>, vol. <span style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;>77</span>, no. 2, 2007). I <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that the above &quot;umbrella concepts&quot; cannot be conceived of as semantically <span>neutral</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>constructs because <span>ultimately</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> the definition of concepts draws on various discourses. Discourses are ideological in that they win over the <span>speaking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>subjects by formulating a positive associative content for concepts so that they can legitimize themselves. From this <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> information behaviour and information practice are not &quot;ideologically innocent&quot;; both concepts incorporate the discursive power to name and legitimize. </p>

<p>Interestingly, one of Tom's comments is very indicative of this issue. He suggests that &quot;<span style="font-style:italic;";>the generic concept is behaviour – hence, for example, the 'behavioural sciences' – we do not <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the 'action sciences' or the 'practice sciences': the others are elements of behaviour – actions, activities – or a <span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of behaviour – practice</span>&quot;. Later on, Tom writes: &quot;<span style="font-style:italic;";>In my understanding the common <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is human behaviour which is composed of <span>cognitive</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> physical and social actions, which constitute activities<span style="font-style:italic;";></span></span>&quot;. Obviously, the <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that behaviour is a more generic (or common) category than <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or practice suggests the existence of a discursive formation that legitimizes behaviour as generic. However, this may not be a value-neutral <span>postulate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>because all classifications imply <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of some <span>kinds</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Therefore, classifications tend to be sites of discursive struggles. In the above case, the relationship between generic (behaviour) and specific (practice) is constructed and legitimized within the discourse on behaviour. We may think that in a similar vein, information practice can be constructed as a more specific category than information behavior. Tom's comment provides support to this assumption: (information) practice is conceived of as an element or <span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of (information) behaviour. The power to name of this kind may <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the view that the concept of information behaviour is fairly well <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in information studies, while the concept of information practice is perceived as its challenger. </p> 

<p>Tom provides useful clarifications to the issue of behaviourism. I will not comment on it here because as a whole, behaviourism seems to be a <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>theme with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the <span>characterization</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information behaviour. Instead of behaviourism, it might be more fruitful to shift <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to behavioural sciences and <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in greater depth on how to characterize the <span>attribute</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot;behavioural&quot; related to information. However, thinking Tom's reply, I found more interesting his critique towards the practice theories. Tom writes: &quot;<span style="font-style:italic;";>The <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that practice <span>theorists</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>have is that by deliberately opposing the concept of behaviour, they lose all <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of developing a distinctive, coherent theory</span>&quot;. Again, we may identify a site of discursive struggle here. However, as to the development of the theory projects of Bourdieu and Giddens, for example, it seems to me that they have not primarily been driven by the motive of &quot;<span style="font-style:italic;";>deliberately opposing the concept of behaviour</span>&quot;. Rather, Bourdieu and Giddens were interested in renewing sociological theory by proposing conceptions such as habitus and structuration. </p> 

<p>I <span>agree</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with Tom's view that the current practice theories are far from coherent. On the other hand, this <span>criticism</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>may be applicable to the theories of behaviour as well. Which of them would be most relevant for the development of the models of information behaviour? There may be no obvious candidates. Tom asks a similar question: &quot;<span style="font-style:italic;";>if we are to adopt 'practice' in place of 'behaviour' – which theory of practice will we use, and how will we use it to explore what I call 'information behaviour?</span>&quot;  </p>

<p>I employed Schatzki's practice theory and in my view it provides a useful <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for the conceptualization of everyday information <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> However, in my view, we should not substitute practice for behaviour in the above context. Both information behaviour and information practice can be constructed as equally legitimate, without attempting to reduce one to another. In fact, Tom provides constructive examples of  how to define practice in its own right as customary or habitual activity. On the other hand, he writes: &quot;<span style="font-style:italic;";>I do not view behaviour and practice as being in opposition, but neither do I view them as having equal theoretical status</span>&quot;. This suggests that in the end, behaviour should be given a privileged <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>over practice because the former is the generic and common <span>phenomenon</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Interestingly, in this way we are back with questions of power to name. </p> 

<p>Tom concludes his reply with a request: &quot;<span style="font-style:italic;";>if we are to use practice as an analytical concept we need to define it rigorously – not for all time, of course, but at least for the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of any given investigation</span>&quot;. This suggestion is highly relevant and it might be broadened to include information behaviour, too. Thus, researchers should not take any umbrella concepts as given. To this end, they should generate a self-reflexive and critical attitude to the definition and <span>justification</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of concepts. This attitude is highly desirable, independent whether researchers prefer information behaviour or information practice as an umbrella concept that reflects best their meta-theoretical and methodological <span>commitments</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>Comment from <span>Michael</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Olsson</h2>

<p>I have not yet had the opportunity to read Reijo's book, so my comments must perforce be based on the debate here and my <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of Reijo's previous work in this area, such as his 2007 LQ article. So I may be somewhat ill-equipped to wade into this debate – however, since Tom has invited others to comment, I thought I'd chime in with my two penn'orth.</p>

<p>At the outset, it seems to me that it might be useful to point out that one of the things that makes this debate between Tom and Reijo so interesting – but also so complex - is <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>their fairly high level of agreement. Implicit in their discussion, for example, seems to be an <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that information research is <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>sociological. While this is a viewpoint I wholeheartedly share, I wonder if, in an inter-disciplinary field which over the last few decades has seen much influence from <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>science, <span>psychology</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> HCI, communication, this view is <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as widely <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as the debate so far might imply? I also wonder if <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of 'behaviour' in our own field have given as much <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the social as the sociological debate Tom <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to? It seemed to me on <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Reijo's LQ article that one of the key <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>he was identifying with an emergent 'information <span>practices</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> paradigm was a more overtly sociological approach to information research.</p>

<p>Of course, even if we <span>agree</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that information research is, as I remember Tom telling me as an impressionable Ph.D student, &quot;essentially applied sociology&quot;, there remains the question as to what kind of sociology it is. Perhaps one of the <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>we face in understanding the implications of 'practices' <span>theorists</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>like Bourdieu, Giddens, Foucault etc for our field is that their work is largely macro-sociological in orientation, looking at long-term historical/cultural/epistemic trends, whilst information research is <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>micro-sociological. It does strike me however, and I believe that this is part of Tom's point, that information research into these issues must perforce be very different - in methodology, in <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>– from that of much work in sociology etc usually associated with a 'practices' orientation. Indeed Reijo's own <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>work is an example of this.</p>

<p>Perhaps if there is a distinction to be made between an 'information behaviour' and 'information <span>practices</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> paradigm, it is a subtle one of orientation: the former sees the object of research as the individual information seeker/user (often characterised in terms of their <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>structures) and examines how they may be <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by social factors; while the latter sees information users as 'social beings'.</p>

<p>I was particularly struck by the fact that in the course of the discussion Tom has raised three <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>areas that have been largely unexamined by information researchers: the information use; the relationship between information and power; and the embodiment of knowledge. Why is it that these key issues have been largely unexplored in our field? Are these questions that, as Reijo suggests, an 'information <span>practices</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> orientation equips us better to engage with? Certainly my own research in this area has been heavily <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by Foucault. – exploring, for example, Foucault's 'battle for <span>truth</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> as it is played out in the everyday lives (behaviours? practices?) of individuals in their <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with information.</p>

<p>Dervin has been known to describe Sense-Making as a &quot;methodology between the cracks&quot; and perhaps something similar is needed here? <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>'sociological' approach to information research which draws on multiple <span>traditions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to explore these under-examined issues?</p>

<h2>Comment from Mary Cavanagh</h2>

<p>I would like to wade into this friendly debate about the concepts of behavior and practice. Before I proceed with a comparative discussion of these terms from my current (read emerging) <span>analytic</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>perspective, I will first <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to comments made by both Professors Savolainen and Wilson in their commentaries already posted. The <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of my argument will very quickly be exposed. I will also acknowledge up front that I have not (yet) read <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Savolainen's book and therefore I cannot comment on his use of the terms in that work. I have, however, recently completed my doctoral thesis titled 'Making the invisible visible: the public library <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>service as epistemic practice'; I am closely attuned to and interested in the notions of behavior and of practice in the <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>field of library and information science.</p>

<p>That the works of Bourdieu and Giddens are deemed to be &quot;so 19 th century ... as to be totally untenable in the 21 <span>st</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot; seems to me to be an argument about an apparent simplicity in Bourdieu and Giddens, not about the idea of practice and its contemporary <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>which emerged only partially from these earlier ideas of structuration and practise – <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>please the recent <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of (yes primarily) sociologists such as Knorr-Cetina, Schatzki, Gherardi and Antonocoupolou or even <span>Latour</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>s actor-network theory. Understanding how subjects and objects variously act, interact and/or behave together, both habitually and unpredictably across time-space fields is a much more complex <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of study and argumentation. Moreover understanding precisely what is, behaviourally, a subject or an object in our technology-girded, online societies is also a wider debate (Knorr-Cetina, Wittel, Turkle).</p>

<p>I accept that behaviour as a concept incorporates social, <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and physical dimensions and also want to <span>agree</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Savolainen's observation that behaviour draws more <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on (social) <span>psychology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>while practice draws more on sociology and social philosophy. Perhaps there's some basis for that difference, some rationale that matters to our <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information seeking, <span>finding</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> using and sharing. Perhaps we should follow this difference a little further and see what we learn.</p>

<p>And given that words &quot;triggers&quot; and &quot;stimuli&quot; provoke such strong responses and counter-responses from both Wilson and Savolainen suggests to me that the terms are not nearly as 'transparent' or definitionally <span>rigorous</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as any behavioural or a practice-theorist might believe. I would also throw the word &quot;mechanisms&quot; (from management / organizational literature) into this conceptual bowl of soup.</p>

<p>Like both writers, I also do not view behaviour and practice as being in opposition – I view behaviour and practice (without the adjective 'information') as slightly different and differently 'pitched' concepts. I would like to introduce a view from organizational studies via Gherardi because I think it could add to this discussion. She defines practice initially as the <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot;where doing and knowing are one and the same&quot; – and of course this looks very much like the social/cognitive/physical idea of behaviour just noted ;-). The distinctive <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of practice, however, which Gherardi adds and then emphasizes is the dimension of material connectivity or relationship that binds activities and behaviours together in material ways – similar to <span>Latour</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>s process of translation. Practices are <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of subject-object activities that become habitualized and habitualizing at the same time as they are destabilized and destabilizing. Activities are constantly changing and thus the notion of practice while perhaps more visible through rules and routines is more accurately 'structured' by its <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>stance towards change and learning. Practice is the &quot;'figure of discourse' that allows the processes of &quot;knowing' at work and learning in organizing to be articulated&quot; (Gherardi, 2007, xiv). Behaviours on the other hand are not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>constituted by the same array of <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>between subjects and objects institutionalized across the time-space field. Practices are made up of behaviours. I acknowledge this is a fine distinction – requiring much more research within our <span>discipline</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>- but which I <span>table</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for further talk and study.</p>

<p>From my <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> I understand behaviours as more individual and mentalistic, discrete, not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>material and they tend to be more susceptible to a process of unitization or transactionalization, even as they are situated in complex social <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Whereas <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are more difficult to bound, and rarely 'end' or 'begin'. In my study of public library <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>service I spent 170 hours at four different <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>'desks' <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>notes on 480 <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>interactions including all the activities, behaviours, and talk that occurred between and among <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>staff and library users. I <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>many, many behaviours and activities (putting pencils be0e public internet machines, <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>books on and off book trucks, using the <span>computer</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> answering the telephone, standing up and talking to patrons), but I also <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>a complex array of actions and <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that entailed specific relationships between and among subjects and objects – at its most basic, the <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>between patrons and library staff around questions which are asked and then answered. I argue that these <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are micro-practices and that the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>service as a whole is more visible in its entirety when <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as a practice. Like Savolainen, I also use the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>'everyday' to characterize the public library <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>service. And is a 'reference <span>interaction</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> also <span>identical</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>conceptually to an 'information behaviour'? I think it would be difficult to argue this. I moved to practice-based theory because that's what my data and analysis were suggesting – that the more relevant <span>ontological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>unit of study is not the information behaviour but rather, the practice – for understanding how knowing and learning <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>at the public library's <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>desk.</p>

<p>We could say that the difference between these terms is simply a historical-political turn by <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of academics. However, the renewed prevalence of practice-based study and theorizing in the philosophy, organizational and managerial studies suggests that it is a concept which is useful where behaviour simply is not, and is not enough. From an information studies <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> I would argue for the relevance of practice-based theory as another lens through which we can learn more and learn differently about the field of information. And I am now waiting for Savolainen's book to arrive in my mail.</p>

<h2>Comment from 'David'</h2>

<p>A fascinating debate :)</p>

<p>I was interested in Reojo's last statement that researchers should:</p>

<p>&quot;...prefer information behaviour or information practice as an umbrella concept that reflects best their meta-theoretical and methodological <span>commitments</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot;</p>

<p>My tentative view is that in practice much of the research conducted within the two different concepts doesn't differ in any significant way (ontologically, epistemologically or methodologically). Indeed, I thought that Practice Theory in its home <span>discipline</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of sociology is in its nature a 'broad church' encompassing a wide <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of meta-theoretical and methodological perspectives?</p>

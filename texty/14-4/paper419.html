<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The <em>research-practice gap</em> is a widely experienced phenomenon in a number of fields of professional activity, including not only librarianship but also education (e.g., <a href="#car97">Carnine 1997</a>), social work (e.g., <a href="#hen06">Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>) and nursing (e.g., <a href="#mul01">Mulhall 2001</a>).  The problem, if it is perceived as such, seems to be the result of the gradual divorce of practice from training for the profession.  Most of these fields have evolved from apprenticeship systems, through training (often directed by professional bodies), to the establishment of degree programmes, research and doctoral studies. In the process, the norms of practice are replaced by the norms of the academy and the split becomes institutionalised.</p>

<p>In librarianship, as long ago as 1984 <a href="#bli84">Blick</a> presented an almost confrontational view of the problem and since then the subject has been addressed in a variety of ways (e.g., <a href="#had04">Haddow and Klobas 2004</a>; <a href="#mcc89">McClure 1989</a>; <a href="#man82">Mancall <em>et al.</em> 1982</a>).  Powell <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#pow02">2002</a>) investigated the involvement in research of American and Canadian librarians and the extent of use of research results in their practice and discovered that though many regard research literature as irrelevant to their jobs, a significant majority reads research literature and conducts research themselves. There is also a range of studies looking for the ways to close the gap.   McKechnie <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#mck08">2008</a>) investigate how information seeking research community communicates its findings to the practicing librarians and information specialists. Interest in the subject is growing, as witnessed by the establishment of the journal <em><a href="http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fejournals.library.ualberta.ca%2Findex.php%2FEBLIP&amp;date=2009-12-07">Evidence Based Library and Information Practice</a></em>.</p> 

<p>Library and information science research has developed in Sweden mainly over the last decade. It is young in comparison with other countries, but, as elsewhere, discussions about the applicability of research results in the professional practice are intense. The University of Bor&aring;s, the largest library and information research institution in Sweden, has organized regular meetings between professional librarians and researchers to highlight  issues of communication between these two groups for several years. The participants of these meetings have emphasised the need for more meeting spaces, communication channels for better information dissemination, ways to identify the most relevant research issues for practice, and the need to find funding sources for research (<a href="#hog07">H&ouml;gskolan i Bor&aring;s 2007</a>).</p> 

<p>We have conducted a project that aimed to address the issue by bringing Swedish library practitioners and researchers into a common project using the Delphi technique.  The aim was to determine the areas of research that would provide the evidence for future action and to establish the priorities among these research areas.</p>

<p>The project was directed towards all Swedish libraries without regard to their type, community served, region, etc. However, we were aware that the differences between library sectors defined as library systems comprised of one library type might be very significant. Special libraries serve the needs of a clearly defined group of users, while public libraries address heterogeneous communities. Academic and school libraries exist in the educational sector, but the age and interests of their readers may be worlds apart, not to speak of the parent organizations' goals and environment. Therefore, our research questions anticipated that there would be differences in the research interests of librarians from the different sectors:</p>

<ol>
<li>How far can consensus be achieved on the importance of research issues among the representatives of different library sectors and in which areas?</li>
<li>What differences are there in the perception of library research priorities among representatives of different library sectors?</li>
<li>What differences are there in the perception of present and future library research issues?</li>
</ol>

<h2>The Delphi process</h2>

<p>The Delphi method resulted from work at the RAND Corporation during the 1950s and 1960s and was designed as a forecasting technique. The intention was to attempt to forecast the effect of new technologies on the conduct of war, but the method was quickly adapted to other areas and to a variety of decision-making purposes.</p> 

<p>Dalkey (<a href="#dal69">1969</a>) defined the method in a RAND Corporation report: </p>

<blockquote>The Delphi technique is a method of eliciting and refining group judgements... The procedures have three features: (1) Anonymous response-opinions of members of the group are obtained by formal questionnaire. (2) Iteration and controlled feedback- interaction is effected by a systematic exercise conducted in several iterations, with carefully controlled feedback between rounds. (3) Statistical group response-the group opinion is defined as an appropriate aggregate of individual opinions on the final round. These features are designed to minimize the biasing effects of dominant individuals, of irrelevant communications, and of group pressure towards conformity. </blockquote>

<p>Dalkey noted that the rationale for the method was the notion that '<em>two heads are better than one</em>', and we might note that the method generally involves rather more than two heads.</p>

<p>The strength of the method, with its anonymous responses and multiple rounds, is the possibility to elicit ideas and opinions from persons experienced in a particular field, to allow these individuals to learn about each others' ideas and to develop consensus and understanding of the priorities and strong differences. Both researchers and experts are assumed to modify their initial impressions in this process.</p>

<p>Following its development at RAND, the method was not without its critics. For example, Sackman (<a href="#sac74">1974</a>), also from RAND, suggested that the method should not be employed until it was more scientifically grounded. In spite of criticisms, however, the method continued to be developed and applied in a variety of fields.</p> 

<p>Delphi studies in librarianship and information science have been used for a variety of purposes. Some early investigations are now of only historic interest, since the forecast period has passed or because the issues discussed have become less salient.</p>

<p>The Delphi technique has been used for a variety of managerial purposes in libraries, e.g., in quite an early study Pierce and Andrew used the method '<em>to obtain consensus between librarians, faculty and administrators on a set of objectives for a university library's resource allocations…</em>' (<a href="#pie84">1984</a>: 35).  Ludwig and Starr (<a href="#lud05">2005</a>) explored the future of the library as a place, with '<em>An expert panel of health sciences librarians, building consultants, architects, and information technologists…</em>' (315). In another study, Cole and Harer (<a href="#col05">2005</a>) identified aspects of quality measures for academic library services. Howze and Dalrymple (<a href="#how04">2004</a>) used the Delphi method to determine the content of an information literacy programme and, in a related area, Green (<a href="#gre00">2000</a>) employed the method to select Web sites appropriate to adult learners in the field of business studies. Recently, a re-organization of the Institute of Library Science at Humboldt University in Berlin was based on the Delphi study involving an international group of expert opinions (<a href="#jan05">J&auml;nsch <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>).</p> 

<p>Forecasts of possible futures have also been produced: for example, Feret and Marcinek (<a href="#fer05">2005</a>), in a follow-up to an investigation carried out in 1999, polled thirty-six experts in twenty countries on the future of the academic library and the academic librarian. Research issues were not covered in the study, but the areas of concern identified are suggestive of research possibilities: for example, the role of the library in the overall university infrastructure, the role of co-operation in the digital age, changes in the required competencies of library staff, and so on. Forecasts have also been limited to specific countries, such as the investigation carried out by Baruchson-Arbib and Bronstein (<a href="#bar02">2002</a>), which surveyed views of the future of the library and information profession in Israel. This study also identified areas relevant to the investigation reported here: changing professional competencies, the varying roles of traditional and virtual libraries and the impact of the user-centred approach to service. Petuchovait&#279; (<a href="#pet04">2004</a>) investigated the development priorities in public librarianship in Lithuania. Potential research directions also may be derived from her results. An early study in Sweden (<a href="#swe71">Statskontoret 1971</a>) explored possible developments in a variety of information functions, the early date, however, means that the projections to the mid-1980s are no longer of great interest. A later Finnish study (<a href="#kos89">Koskiala and Huhtanen 1989</a>) forecast developments in information technology use for 1996 and 2010. A number of the forecasts for 2010 ring true in 2008: for example, the proposition that, by 2010, 90% of scientific and technical information will be in electronic form and that small circulation journals will be electronic only. The method used in this study was to bring together thirty-two Finnish experts in two consecutive sessions and to supplement their views with those of eleven foreign experts.</p>

<p>The technique has also been used in other fields to determine research needs, for example, Kirkwood <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#kir03">2003</a>) employed it in determining research needs in a UK National Health Service hospital. The authors note that the method proved useful and it is interesting to see that at least three research areas could well be replicated in libraries, i.e., recruitment and retention of staff, staff stress and morale, and staff training and education.</p> 

<p>A recently published study by Eldredge <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#eld09">2009</a>) uses the Delphi method in establishing a research agenda for the Medical Library Association. As a result of the Delphi process a list of top twelve research questions was derived. The questions are formulated in such a way as to be suitable for immediate investigation. In this way, the authors provide a research agenda suitable for the implementation of the research policy of the Association.</p>


<h2> The Swedish Delphi study</h2>

<p>This review of previous Delphi studies in librarianship shows that most are directed at the solution of pressing problems or determining the development directions of a variety of institutions (different kinds of libraries, specialised library sectors, library and information science education departments, etc.).  It is one of a few techniques available for seeking consensus and other methods generally involve face-to-face group activity. The close involvement of the professionals as panel members in these studies provides valid outcomes and forms a basis for further research and the Delphi method . </p>  

<p>The review suggests that the Delphi method is very suitable for conducting a project, which has not only to produce solid research results, but must also build the trust of the professional communities, which are in the position of using these results directly in their activities. As in many other cases, in this study the Delphi method was adapted to suit its purpose. The aim was not only to reach consensus, but also to highlight the differences of research interests among library sectors. Consequently, special attention was paid to the selection of panel members and in formulating the research issues for evaluation. The panel members participated in two survey rounds assessing the importance of the research issues presented to them. Finally, a group of panel members was invited to a workshop to achieve the final result, the identification of the top research priorities for Swedish librarianship as a whole.</p> 

<h3>Selection of panel members</h3>

<p>Most Delphi studies, as Howze and Dalrymple (<a href="#how04">2004</a>) note, use a panel of experts dispersed over large areas or bring together those with different backgrounds and perspectives. Their own project was directed in one organization to reach a consensus among a relatively homogenous group of participants. It also aimed to solve a '<em>real-life library problem</em>' (p. 3). Our study brings together a group of the library professionals from different types of libraries in Sweden. The group is dispersed geographically over the whole of Sweden and to some extent their location was taken into account to represent regional aspects of libraries. Their background is homogenous in respect that they are all acknowledged authorities in the professional field, but they were deliberately chosen from different types of libraries as we expected that the contextual, functional and structural differences of libraries would influence research priorities. Swedish librarians nominated the panel members after we sent a call through the channels of professional communication. Thus, we ensured that the panel members were perceived as <em>experts</em> by their peers.</p>  

<p>Initially 125 librarians were invited to participate, equally distributed over the different library sectors, and ultimately we formed a panel of ninety-seven members who had accepted the invitation, distributed over the different sectors as follows: </p> 

<ul>
<li>Regional and regional librarians  	18 </li>
<li>Public librarians 	15 </li>
<li>Academic and research librarians 	24 </li>
<li>School librarians 	23 </li>
<li>Special librarians 	18 </li>
</ul>
 
<p>It may seem that the balance in the panel is shifted to the side of public libraries as county and regional and public libraries are represented by thirty-three experts. However, in the Swedish library system, county and regional librarians fulfil advisory and strategic development functions in the region and do not manage physical libraries. Their role in the system is quite specific. Nevertheless, we employed means allowing us to avoid any  bias in further stages of investigation. </p>

<h3>Identification of the research issues</h3>

<p>The help of librarians was also enlisted in formulating the research issues for the questionnaire. The practicing professional and researchers may understand research and research questions differently; however, in this project, the aim was to represent the point of view of working professionals, not the researchers. Therefore, we sought to identify issues of concern to professionals rather than identify very specific, immediately researchable questions.</p>

<p>Approximately 150 research issues were received from all library and information sectors. In addition, the list was enhanced by scanning a variety of sources: discussion lists on library and information matters (e.g., BIBLIST in Sweden, LITA-L, ACRL-FRM and CENTRALHEADS in the USA and LIS-LINK in the UK), Swedish, Danish, English, German and French professional journals (e.g., <em>Biblioteksbladet</em>, <em>Bok og Bibliotek</em>, <em>Scandinavian Public Library Quarterly</em>, <em>Library + Information Update</em>, <em>Library Journal</em>, <em>Information Outlook</em>, <em>School Library Media Research</em>, <em>Bibliothek Forschung und Praxis</em>, <em>Bulletin des biblioth&egrave;ques de France</em> and others). As a result the initial list consisted of 200 items. </p>

<p>The next step was to reduce this list to manageable proportions by scanning it, identifying eight broad thematic areas and then grouping the ideas into cognate categories. Wilson's (<a href="#wil01">2001</a>) Venn diagram (see Fig. 1), which shows the connections between elements that define the scope of librarianship, was employed for this purpose. Each category was then reviewed with a view to identifying a researchable theme that would cover all, or a number of, the items. Seemingly similar topics may appear in several areas covering specific research aspects of a complex issue. </p>

<div align="center"><img src="p419fig1.png" width="589" height="420" alt="Figure 1: Wilson's Venn diagram " /></div>
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 1: Wilson's Venn diagram </strong></div>

<p>The eight broad thematic areas were:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Library policy and legislation issues [The contextual framework of the diagram above]</li>
<li>Research issues relating to the acquisition, organization, digitization, etc., of library and information resources and collections. [Section BD in Figure 1]</li>
<li>Users  [Section ABD]</li>
<li>Technology and tools for library resource management  [Section BCD]</li>
<li>Library management I - strategy and co-operation  [Section D]</li>
<li>Library management II - management of library work [Section CD]</li>
<li>The changing profession [Section AD]</li>
<li>Service delivery and development [Section ABCD]</li>
</ul>
 
<p>Allocation of the areas in the Venn diagram is conditional. It is assumed that the blue area refers to a library as an organization; therefore all library-related issues are situated within the blue-lined area, although, in fact, in many cases they will also be found outside it.</p>  

<p>As a result, sixty-four research topics formed out of 200 smaller research questions were distributed across eight broad research areas. Swedish translations of the research topics, including the exemplifying research questions, were refined during several pre-testing exercises with the librarians and library researchers acting as advisors to the research team. The full list of sixty-four themes can be found in the <a href="#app">Appendix</a>.</p>  

<h3>Results</h3>

<h4>The first survey</h4>

<p>The first round questionnaire was distributed to the panel members by e-mail on the 16th April 2008. The panel members were asked to rank the significance of each of the sixty-four research topics on the scale of 1 to 10 (least important to most important) and to return their completed responses either by e-mail or by ordinary mail by May 8. On May 6 an e-mail message was sent to all panel members reminding them of the due date for return. This resulted in further returns and some apologies for having to withdraw from the panel because of illness or unexpected work pressures.  </p>

<p>Seventy-eight responses were received by the final due date, a response rate of 80% of the original panel, or of 86% when the six withdrawals were taken into account. Given how the panel was chosen and their prior agreement to participate, we had hoped for a 100% response rate; however, the achieved rate is very satisfactory for a study of this kind. The responses were distributed over the different sectors as follows: </p> 

<ul>
<li>Regional and regional librarians 	18 (100%) </li>
<li>Public librarians 	13 (87%) </li>
<li>Academic and research librarians 	19 (79%) </li>
<li>School librarians 	15 (65%) </li>
<li>Special librarians 	13 (72%)</li>
</ul>

<p>The top twenty topics, shown by overall rank, with the associated rank in each sector are shown in Table 1.</p>

<p>A Spearman rank correlation test was carried out and, although the significance levels cannot be used, because of the non-random selection of panel members, the results show quite high levels of agreement between Regional, Public and School ranks and between Academic and Special library ranks.</p>

<p>Table 1 above shows that the highest overall ranks were attributed to the research issues relating library work to education. The research on assessing the library role and work is also placed high on the agenda in the first survey round. Library services and some economic issues have also attracted attention as priority research areas.</p>  

<p>On the other hand the topics related to library as a profession and a number technology related topics were ranked very low (see Table 3)</p>

<p>The bottom of the table also shows more agreement between the panel members from different library sectors about low priority of the issues.</p>

<h3>The second survey</h3>

<p>The second round questionnaire was composed of forty-two research topics, which were selected using the rankings from the first round. This decision was prompted by the fact that during the first round the participants achieved almost unanimous consensus on the items of very low priority. Only the top twenty items from each library sector were selected. This allowed an equal representation of the interests of each sector in the second round questionnaire.  </p>

<p>The selected items were listed in one sequence according to their numbers of the first questionnaire, without the division into the sub-sectors used in the first round. The panel members were again asked to score the priority of each item, but were provided with information on how the topic had been ranked in the first round. They were also asked to indicate what priority they believed the topic would have five years from now. The form of the questions is shown in the example (Fig. 2).</p>

<p>The amount of work involved in responding to the Delphi questionnaire during the first round proved to be somewhat overwhelming for several respondents and we received some requests to take some names out of our list. Thus, ninety-two questionnaires were sent out during the second round at the end of August 2008. Four messages were returned, as delivery to the indicated addresses failed. One person was unable to answer. The overall response rate after two reminders by the end of September was 70%. Across the sectors the response rates were as follows:</p>  

<ul>
<li>County and regional librarians  13 (sent 18) (72%) </li>
<li>Public librarians 	14 (sent 16) (88%) </li>
<li>Academic and research librarians 	14 (sent 24) (58%) </li>
<li>School librarians 	12 (sent 20) (60%) </li>
<li>Special librarians 	11 (sent 14) (79%) </li>
</ul>


<p>As noted above, panel members were asked to rate the importance of topics for the present and for five years in the future.  Given our interest in policy for the future of libraries, we report here the results of the ranking for the future significance of investigations (Table 4).</p>

<p>The table shows that regional and public librarians shared fewer topics with the overall top twenty, while academic, school and special librarians shared more.  The range in the first survey was from 50% to 85%, while in the second round it was 65% to 75%.  The shift in special librarians' judgements from 50% agreement with the top 20% to 70% agreement is particularly noteworthy.  It suggests that, in thinking about the future, their judgements were closer to their colleagues in other sectors.</p>

<p>Five topics were new to the top twenty: these were, <em>Digital resources management</em> (ranked 30 in the first round), <em>Web 2.0 applications in libraries</em> (21), <em>Library co-operation with other institutions</em> (31), <em>Developing search/retrieval systems</em> (36) and <em>Strategic planning of library services</em> (29).  Interestingly, three of these five new topics were technology-related: as noted early such topics were generally ranked lowly in the first round survey.</p>

<p>The main issues that have risen in the top twenty list were, <em>Marketing library and information services</em> (from 11th to 6th), <em>Impact of the promotion of reading</em> (15th to 7th) <em>Implication of user studies</em> (14th to 8th) <em>Impact of digitisation projects</em> (18th to 10th) and <em>Strategic development of new services</em> (20th to 11th).  The implication here appears to be that panel members were giving future priority to research areas with strategic implications, something that emerged in the workshop, as explained below.</p>

<p>There were also two issues that have fallen but that have remained in the top twenty:  <em>The library as creative space</em>, which fell from 8th to 18th position and <em>Evaluation of services</em>, which fell from 9th to 19th.  The main 'fallers', however, were those that dropped out of the top twenty altogether.  These were, <em>Developments in scholarly communication</em>, <em>Reading research</em>, <em>Guidelines for information literacy programmes</em>, <em>Library integration and collaboration</em> and <em>The impact of digital services.</em>  These topics, however, are still fairly highly ranked; all are in the top thirty topics.</p> 

<p>The results revealed some differences between the present and future significance of research issues.  Some issues change their position in the list as the topics are perceived as somewhat more significant for the future research, e.g., <em>Marketing library and information resources</em> becomes 6 (future) instead of 9 (present); Strategic development of new services – 11 instead of 14; Economic significance of libraries – 13 instead of 15; Implications of user studies – 8 instead of 12; etc. The others are ranked a little lower for the future: Librarian and education – 9 instead of 6; Web 2.0 application in libraries – 14 instead of 10; Library as creative space – 18 instead of 13, Reference service in the digital age – 16 instead of 7, etc.</p> 

<p>The issues <em>Guidelines for information literacy programmes</em>, <em>Design of library Websites</em> and <em>Digital media in research</em> disappear from the top twenty priorities for the future (though the latter falls only to the 21st position) and three new issues are included: <em>Impact of digitization projects</em> (10 instead of 21); <em>Evaluation of services</em>, and <em>Strategic planning in libraries</em>. </p>

<p>The final stage of the study was to organize a workshop with participation from the different sectors. This modification is usual for many Delphi studies (de Meyrick 2003). The workshop was introduced into the Delphi process as an interactive element of face-to-face negotiations for seeking consensus following the recommendations of de Loe (1995). According to Loe, when there is no pressure to seek consensus the need to critically evaluate the suggestions diminishes.</p>  

<p>The Workshop took place in Gothenburg on 21st November 2008, with sixteen participants. </p>

<p>It was evident from the two rounds of surveys that the dominant factor in assessing the priority of the research topics was the library sector within which the panel member worked. Consequently, when it came to devising the workshop, we decided to recognize the differences when drawing up the list of topics to be reviewed.</p>

<p>We began by selecting those topics that appeared in the top ten topics of at least two sectors in the rankings of both current significance and future significance.  This resulted in 13 topics and a 14th was added by the inclusion of <em>Selling the library</em>, which was the only other topic to occur in the top ten of both sets of ranks.  The fourteen topics are shown in Table 4.</p>

<p>The workshop participants were divided into four groups in such a way that people from different sectors worked together. Each group was presented with a set of cards bearing the expanded version of the topic areas listed above. They were asked to arrange the cards in order of priority using the 'Diamond nine' technique (expanded to cope with fourteen items). Figure 3 shows the layout, indicating that the groups had to decide upon an order of priority for each item from '<em>Very high priority</em>' to '<em>Very low priority</em>'. </p>

 <p>In a second round, the four groups were combined into two and were asked to reach agreement on priorities, using the same technique.</p>

<p>Finally, in the feedback session, the two groups reported their priority judgements and stated their arguments for the choice of the '<em>Very high priority</em>' item. The priority judgements were given scores from 5 for Very high priority to 1 for Very low priority and the scores summed to provide a final priority order for the top ten items.  The result is shown in Table 6. </p>

<p>Where scores are tied, the items have been ranked according to the degree of agreement between the groups, thus, <em>Children and libraries in the digital age</em> appears in fourth position because the two preceding topics show closer agreement between the groups.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>The first round questionnaire survey revealed both a degree of consensus on the significance of the research themes listed and differences in perceived needs in the different library sectors (i.e., regional, public, academic, school and special libraries).  The most surprising result, from the investigators' point of view, was the low ranking given to professional issues topics, for example <em>Librarianship as a profession</em> (ranked 55), <em>Job satisfaction and identity</em> (59), <em>Public image of librarians</em> (63) and the <em>Role of professional associations</em> (64).  Such matters are discussed in the professional journals, and at conferences in Sweden (e.g., <em>DIK Forum</em>, <em>Biblioteksbladet</em>, M&ouml;tesplats inf&ouml;r framtiden) and books are published on these issues (e.g., the latest one being H&auml;ggstr&ouml;m <em>et al.</em> 2008) and, consequently, it was surprising to find them ranked so low.</p>

<p>Equally surprising was the low ranking of most technology-related topics, given their prominence in the professional discourse in many countries. For example, <em>Evaluation of digital library software</em> (ranked 46), <em>Implications of new technology</em> (51), <em>Virtual reality</em> (58) and <em>Implementing wireless networks</em> (62). There was some variation by sector in this regard, but overall, the topics ranked low.</p>

<p>It is clear that the second round survey did not bring about any further consensus among the respondents, especially when thinking about future priorities. The differences between the libraries remained.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p419fig4.png" width="726" height="334" alt="Table 7: Differences between future priorities of academic, special, and public libraries" /></div>
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Table 7: Differences between future priorities of academic, special, and public libraries</strong><br /> <span style="font-size: 80%;">Note: Red=issues not shared with any other library sector;<br /> green=issues shared with academic sector; <br />black=issues shared with other sectors.</span></div>

<p>Table 7 shows that special libraries sector shares with other sectors only half of its top ten priorities, while public libraries have most in common with others. Academic libraries have only one topic that is not among the top ten of others (<em>Economic significance of libraries</em>).</p>

<p>The very process of selecting items for inclusion in the workshop, for example, meant that some topics ranked within the top ten of a sector, could not be included in the final list of fourteen topics. Thus, <em>Economic significance of libraries</em>, which was in the top ten of the Academic librarians' priorities, was not shared with any other sector and, consequently, did not get into the final list. Table 8 below shows the topics that were excluded in this way and their position in the sector's top ten. Note that no such topics existed for Public libraries, as all of the top ten of that sector were included in the final fourteen.</p>

</table>

<p>This suggests that the most <em>disadvantaged</em> sector in the process was Special libraries, since half of its top ten topics failed to make it into the final fourteen. </p> 

<p>The panel members also assessed differently the present and the future significance of some research issues. It may be argued that some of them are perceived as '<em>being solved</em>' in the future (e.g., information literacy and Website design). The growth of significance of such issues as <em>strategic planning</em>, <em>cooperation with other institutions</em> and <em>strategic development of services</em>, is most probably related to the vision of uncertain, complicated and more competitive future.</p>

<p>Taking the Delphi process, we believe that it provided a useful means of eliciting expert opinion on the priorities to be assigned to potential research areas.  The work was extremely time-consuming for the panellists (which explains some of the drop-out), but the fact that the great majority stayed with the process and undertook the work is testimony to the perceived importance of the project.  Distributing a questionnaire to the profession at large would probably not have achieved the same result, in terms of response rate, or, indeed, in the reliability of the judgements made.</p>

<p>It should not be thought, however, that the Delphi method is a '<em>quick and dirty</em>' research method:  the determination of research topics alone occupied a significant proportion of the total research effort and this first stage was critical to the overall success of the method.</p>

<p>Of course, the method takes a snapshot in time of the opinions of a particular group of people and, given the pace of change in the sector, it is unlikely that the resultant agenda of research topics will remain relevant for more than a year or so.  Given this fact, however, we now have a basis for further investigation over time, to move from a snapshot study to a longitudinal investigation. We are currently exploring how this might be done. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Regarding the substantive results of the project, the first point to make is that, clearly, the different sectoral interests of librarians makes total consensus virtually impossible to achieve through the survey stages of the Delphi process. Some level of consensus was only reached in the workshop, when debate on the issues could take place and, in effect, negotiation about priorities was possible. The very process of selecting items for inclusion in the workshop, for example, meant that some topics ranked within the top ten of a sector, could not be included in the final list of fourteen topics. Thus, <em>Economic significance of libraries</em>, which was in the top ten of the academic librarians' priorities, was not shared with any other sector and, consequently, did not get into the final list of fourteen topics. Table 8 above shows the topics that were excluded in this way and their position in the sector's top ten. Note that no such topics existed for Public libraries, as all of the top ten of that sector were included in the final fourteen.</p>

<p>The second point is that the priorities, over all, reveal a strong relationship to notions of change, impact and evaluation, which, we believe reflects the extent of uncertainty in the professional community as to the future nature and direction of library and information services. This is revealed, particularly, when we look at the top priorities of the different sectors.  For example, the top ten topics in each sector give a total of twenty-seven topics, nine of which can be characterised as dealing in one way or another with change and a further eight as being concerned with evaluation and/or impact. In other words, librarians are looking for guidance in uncertain times and seeking advice on how to measure and promote the impact of their services.</p>

<p>The public, regional and school libraries are more concerned with relation of libraries to education and society at large, while academic and special libraries emphasize the changes in scholarly and industrial communication and impact of new technologies.</p> 

<p>The third point relates to the differences between future and present significance of research issues. Though most of them remain on the same level, the differences show the rising future significance of research helping to survive in more competitive society among diversified information and culture mediators and providers.</p>

<p>It is also important to point out the value of research in lobbying research councils and government agencies to support research in the field. Sweden, like most countries, has no research funding body, which has resources specifically to support library, and information research. Consequently, in seeking support, researchers are in competition with other disciplines, usually in the social sciences area. In this area, the priorities set for the allocation of resources rarely relate to library or information priorities. The work reported here, however, provides the Svensk Biblioteksf&ouml;rening with a basis for negotiation with the government and the responding research councils.</p>

<p>Finally, the research has implications for teaching, research and practice in general. Swedish library and information practitioners now have, at the very least, the basis for a debate with researchers about what research is of relevance to them and academic institutions have guidance on how they might direct their research efforts to satisfy the needs of practice. </p>

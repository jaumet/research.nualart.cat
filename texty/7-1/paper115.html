<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Small and private companies have traditionally been a big challenge for 
information professionals and other individuals involved in competitive 
intelligence (CI) gathering. These companies do not have to report their 
financial activities to government agencies and they are often neglected in the 
coverage of commercial business information publishers (<a href="#liu00">Liu, 2000</a>). With the 
growth of Internet economy, more than 3,000 new Internet start-up companies have 
been created in the U.S.(<a href="#cen00">Center for Research in Economic Commerce, 2000</a>). Many 
of these companies are small, private and, as supported by recent events among 
dot-com companies, also prone to organizational changes such as mergers, 
acquisitions and dissolutions. Consequently, collecting up-to-date competitive 
information on Internet start-up companies can be rather complicated. </p>
<p>In this paper we report findings from a study of CI activities involving 
Internet start-up companies in the telecommunications industry. The CI gathering 
was conducted by graduate students in library and information science in the 
context of a class project for a real business client, itself a small Internet 
start-up company. The primary objective of the study was to provide empirical 
insights into the applicability of specific types of secondary information 
resources to finding competitive intelligence information on small Internet 
start-up companies. An additional objective was to identify the characteristics 
of research strategies applied in the collection of CI on Internet start-ups 
from the perspective of current conceptual frameworks of information-seeking 
behaviour provided in the library and information science literature. </p>

<h2>Background </h2>
<p>Much of the competitive intelligence literature is focused on practical 
issues in CI gathering, such as techniques of intelligence gathering from both 
primary and secondary information resources. For example, classic work by Fuld 
(1988) provides a general overview of the types of competitive intelligence an 
organization can gather and process. He suggests a number of secondary resources 
that organizations can use to start monitoring their competitors, including 
commercial databases, trade publications, newspapers, and public filings. </p>
<p>More recently, various CI authors focused on the use of Internet resources 
for conducting competitive intelligence research. <a href="#mcr00">McRae</a> (2000) addresses the 
specific techniques that allow competitive intelligence professionals to 
maximize their results on Internet search engines. <a href="#vib00">Vibert</a> (2000) discusses how 
Internet resources can assist organizations in finding specific types of 
competitive intelligence and recommends the use of specialized Internet portals 
such as legal information portals, regulatory information portals, and specialty 
business information portals. According to <a href="#kas99">Kassler</a> (1999) another very valuable 
source of CI is a company website. These websites promise to be especially 
important resources on information on small and private companies. As <a href="#liu00">Liu</a> (2000) 
explains, information on companies such as small banks, high-tech companies, 
furniture stores, printing companies, etc., has been traditionally difficult to 
find because they do not have legal obligations to provide financial reports to 
the government and because they are commonly neglected by commercial publishers. 
With the emergence of e-commerce, however, many small companies have created 
their websites, which provide a wealth of useful information including company 
history, description of products and services, contact information, press 
releases, etc. Liu argues that due to the emergence of these websites the role 
of traditional information producers in providing basic business information is 
increasingly diminishing. </p>
<p>However, the Internet is also seen as a &quot;double-edged sword&quot; for CI gathering 
-- while it offers a wealth of information, it is often difficult to determine 
the origin of the information (<a href="#kas99">Kassler, 1999</a>). For example, many authors caution 
that information gathered from company websites should be accepted with 
reservations because information provided could be, intentionally or 
unintentionally, incorrect (<a href="#gro00">Gross, 2000</a>; <a href="#dis99">Dishman &amp; Nitse, 1999</a>). Therefore, 
common advice for competitive intelligence and other business information 
professionals is to search in multiple sources in order to validate data. <a href="#oja98">Ojala</a> 
(1998), for example, suggests a combination of Web searches with online 
database. Her comparative case study of competitive intelligence research on the 
Web and Dialog identified that these resources complemented one another and that 
they were both needed for most thorough intelligence gathering. </p>
<p><a href="#kle99">Klein</a> (1999), however, suggests that researchers may be missing out on vital 
data if they solely rely on the Internet and online databases. He recommends 
that CI research in secondary sources need to be supplemented with primary 
research, such as field interviews. But the comprehensive search approach in CI 
gathering that combines primary and secondary research may not be an option for 
organizations with very limited financial and human resources. These 
organizations often have to rely only on affordable secondary resources. But is 
this approach in CI gathering the best approach when dealing with &quot;difficult&quot; 
research topics, such as finding information on small and newly-created 
companies? We were curious to find out how the above practical recommendations 
from CI literature about secondary information resources may be applied to the 
CI processes involving small Internet start-up companies. To address this issue 
we formulated our first research question: What secondary resources are useful 
for gathering competitive intelligence on Internet start-up companies? </p>
<p>While the competitive intelligence literature offers an abundance of 
prescriptive suggestions where and how one should gather competitive 
intelligence, little is yet known about the characteristics of 
information-seeking processes applied in CI gathering. The literature in library 
and information science (LIS) provides a number of models and categorizations of 
information-seeking activities in both non-electronic and electronic information 
environments. Classic examples include conceptual models of information seeking 
by <a href="#kuh93">Kuhlthau</a> (1993), <a href="#bat89">Bates</a> (1989), and <a href="#mar97">Marchionini</a> (1997). </p>
<p>In Kuhlthau's Information Search Process (ISP), the information user moves 
through six stages - initiation, selection, exploration, formulation, 
collection, and presentation of information. Each of the stages is characterized 
by interplay of the user's thoughts, feelings, and actions. Moving through these 
stages, an information user transitions from a state of ignorance and 
apprehension about the task at hand to a state of understanding and clarity. 
<a href="#bat89">Bates </a>(1989) explains her &quot;berrypicking&quot; model of information retrieval through 
the metaphor of picking huckleberries and blueberries in the forest. In this 
model of information-seeking behaviour, the information user goes to multiple 
sources and collects bits of information from each in order to gather all of the 
information needed. </p>
<p><a href="#mar95">Marchionini</a> (1995) describes information seeking as both systematic and 
opportunistic. His model of the information-seeking process includes a number of 
subprocesses starting with problem definition and concluding with problem 
resolution. Individual subprocesses can initiate each other sequentially and can 
also appear and disappear as activity modules, depending on the outcomes of the 
user's search activities. Work by <a href="#erd97">Erdelez</a> (1997) expands on the opportunistic 
quality of information acquisition and provides a conceptual framework for 
information encountering, or the unexpected discovery of useful or interesting 
information. Information encountering refers to situations when the information 
user is looking for information on a particular topic, but instead finds 
information relating to another topic. This behaviour can be experienced in 
various types of information environments, including the Web (<a href="#erd00">Erdelez, 2000</a>). 
The uniqueness of accidental discovery of information has been furthermore 
recognized and explored by <a href="#tom00">Toms</a> (2000) and <a href="#wil98">Williamson</a> (1998). </p>

<p>The conceptual frameworks of information-seeking behaviour in the LIS 
literature can be applied within the context of different subject areas of 
users' information needs, including these that drive the information-seeking 
process of CI gathering. The secondary objective of our study was to investigate 
applicability of these frameworks in conducting CI research on Internet start-up 
companies. Thus, our second research question: What information-seeking 
strategies are used for gathering competitive intelligence on Internet start-up 
companies in secondary resources? </p>

<h2>Methodology </h2>
<p>The data for this study were collected in the context of a course assignment 
given to students taking the graduate course in Information Resources in 
Business at a school of library and information science. For this assignment, 
students were asked to find specific types of competitive intelligence 
information for a real client &ndash; a telecommunications start-up company. Each 
student compiled a competitive intelligence report on one of 14 competitor 
companies provided by the client, and wrote a narrative report on the 
information-seeking process he/she used while collecting CI. In the narrative, 
the students were asked to provide chronological, evaluative statements about 
their research steps and to identify the specific types of information resources 
they have used. </p>

<p>Twenty-five students participated in this study. Each student had experience 
in performing basic library reference research with paper-based and online 
resources. The students received in-class training in conducting basic business 
information research using commercial online service providers Dialog and 
Lexis-Nexis and had free access to these services under educational agreements 
with the service providers. Several students had a special interest in 
competitive intelligence research, as they were hoping to work in competitive 
intelligence positions after completing their LIS education. </p>

<p>The students were asked to conduct multi-faceted competitive intelligence 
research similar to the work that competitive intelligence professionals do, but 
limited to secondary resources. Each student was assigned a Internet start-up 
company in the telecommunications industry to research. A manager of the client company provided the names of the companies and a list of  questions for students to 
research. These questions covered the following topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<i>General company information</i> (the company's full name, address, phone and 
fax numbers, URL, contact e-mail addresses, Standard Industry Classification (SIC) 
code, the names of the company's key officers, and the number of employees)</li>
  <li><i>Patents and trademarks</i> held by the company</li>
  <li><i>Business alliances</i> (e.g., partnerships with companies providing various 
types of telephone service plans) and </li>
  <li> <i>Venture capital funding</i>. </li>
</ul>
<p>In order to answer the first research question (What secondary resources are useful 
for gathering competitive intelligence on Internet start-up companies) we 
conducted a content analysis of the narrative portion of students' reports of 
how they conducted their research. These reports were coded for the: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Type of resource used </li>
  <li>Number of unique resource types used </li>
  <li>Number of successful and unsuccessful attempts to find information with a 
  specific resource, and </li>
  <li>Order in which the resources were used.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data were analyzed by the means of descriptive statistics.</p>
<p>Research question two (What information-seeking strategies are used for 
gathering competitive intelligence on Internet start-up companies in secondary 
resources), was also addressed by performing content analysis of students' 
research narratives. The objective of the content analysis was to identify the 
key themes reported in the students' self-evaluative statements. To assure the 
validity of our interpretations of the students' information-seeking activities, 
we also conducted a follow-up group interview with the students. </p>

<h2>Findings </h2>
<p>For clarity of presentation,  our findings are grouped into three main 
sections. First, we will discuss the overall findings on the use of various 
types of secondary resources for CI gathering on Internet start-up companies. 
Then we present findings addressing the use of resources for the collection of 
specific types of CI, requested by the client. Finally, we will summarize the key 
themes that characterize the students' information-search process during the CI 
activities. </p>
<h3>Overall use of resources </h3>
<p>We coded and counted every instance of resource use that was identified in 
students' narrative reports. Data analysis revealed that students used eight 
types of resources to accomplish their competitive intelligence assignment. 
These resource types can be grouped into four major categories: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Web-based resources (company website, search engines, government 
  websites, other business websites) </li>
  <li>Commercial online databases (Lexis/Nexis, Dialog) </li>
  <li>Print resources </li>
  <li>Other resources (a few that did not fit the above three categories).</li>
</ul>
The frequencies of the reported usage of individual resource types are 
summarized in Figure 1. 

<div align="center"><img border="0" src="p115fig1.gif" width="538" height="354"></div>
<div align="center"><b>Figure 1. Use of Resources</b></div>

<p>From a total of 189 reported uses of individual resources 58% (110) referred 
to web-based resources. Commercial online databases were used in 36% (68) of the 
search attempts, and print resources in only 5% (9). Among the individual 
resource types, company websites account for 29% (55) of resources used by 
students, Lexis/Nexis (24%, 45), search engines (22%, 24) and Dialog (12%, 23). 
In only two instances did students reach for other resources - a business CD-ROM 
database and a telephone (in order to verify a correct phone number). </p>
<p>We were also interested in finding out on how many unique types of secondary 
resources the students relied upon to collect competitive intelligence on their 
assigned Internet start-up company. For example, if the student reported using a 
company website five times and the online databases two times we coded such 
behaviour as the use of two unique resource types, i.e., “company website&quot; and 
“online database&quot;. Figure 2 summarizes the total use of the unique resource 
types. </p>

<div align="center"><img border="0" src="p115fig2.gif" width="334" height="243"></div>
<div align="center"><b>Figure 2. Use of Unique Resource Types</b></div>

<p>The lowest number of reported unique resource types used was two and the 
highest was seven. Students, on average, relied on four unique resource types. 
It is also interesting to mention that some students did not report any use of 
resources that were widely relied upon by other students. For example, three 
students did not report the use of company's website, and three students did not 
report the use of any online databases. By examining the overall pattern of 
unique resource used by these six students we noted that they &quot;compensated&quot; for 
the lack of use of one resource type (e.g., online databases) by more extensive 
uses of other types of resources (e.g., web-based resources) and vice-versa. </p>
<p>The students were asked to indicate if they were successful in finding 
information needed in the resources they consulted. On average, there were 5.5 
successful search experiences and less than two negative experiences reported 
per student. The company website was by far the most effective resource. Among the 22 students who reported using company's website in their research, <u>all</u> reported finding at least part of the information needed for the project there. Students commented on the fact that the company website proved to be &quot;the greatest resource,&quot; &quot;the most informative cache of information,&quot; or &quot;primary source&quot; of competitive intelligence information. One student even speculated that the company she was conducting research on may be &quot;marketing itself for a buyout&quot; because it provided a great deal of information about itself on its website. The students were successful in 66% (31) of attempted uses of Lexis-Nexis, and in 73% (19) uses of Dialog. They were least successful in collecting CI from print resources; of the nine students who used print, none found needed information. </p>

<h3>Use of resources for specific type of CI </h3>

<p>Another way of looking at the study data is to report on the resources 
students used to complete the client's request for CI on four topics: general 
company information, patents/trademarks, business alliances, and venture capital 
funding. Figure 3 summarizes the findings.</p>

<div align="center"><b>Figure 3. Use of Resources for Specific Types of CI</b></div>
<div align="center"><img border="0" src="p115fig3.gif"  width="520" height="361"></div>

<p>In order to collect the general company information on the Internet start-up 
companies that were the focus of the CI assignment, students consulted all eight 
unique resource types identified in Figure 1. Most often utilized resource was 
the company website, accounting for 36% (21) of all the instances of uses 
reported. The next most often used category of resources was online databases 
Lexis/Nexis and Dialog, which represented 30% (17) of reported uses. 
Interestingly, general company information was the only topic in the CI 
assignment where students used print resources (8, 14%), i.e., company 
directories. Related to collection of general company information students also 
reported rather low, but successful, use of search engines and other business 
websites. </p>

<p>Finding patent and trademark information related to their Internet start-up 
companies was the most challenging aspect of the CI assignment. As indicated in 
Figure 3 above, students concentrated their search efforts on online databases 
and government websites. The large majority (72%, 23) of these attempts were 
unsuccessful. Many students, however, commented that they were uncertain whether 
the lack of their success should be attributed to the deficiencies of their 
search strategies or to the fact that the Internet start-up company they were 
researching really had not filed any patents/trademarks. It is interesting to 
note that the company website, which was a highly-used resource for all four of 
the CI topics students were researching, was reportedly used only in two 
instances for finding patent/trademark information. Another interesting finding 
is that none of the students reported using a search engine. </p>

<p>In order to find CI on business alliances and venture funding the students used all 
the resources identified in the Figure 1, except the print resources. They also 
reported a very high rate of success (91%) in finding information on this topic. 
The students most often reported using company website, and secondly online 
databases (particularly Lexis/Nexis). Also, alliances was the topic with the 
highest overall use of search engines. Finally, alliances and venture funding, 
combined, had the highest reported usage of other business websites, including 
websites of other competitor companies. </p>

<h3>Information-seeking strategies </h3>

<p>Students' research narratives provided the main source of data on the 
specific search activities they performed to accomplish the task of using 
secondary resources for finding CI on their Internet start-up companies. The 
assignment instructions asked students to provide a two to three page chronological 
narrative describing their search steps and explaining their thought processes 
for the selection of resources. After completing a preliminary reading of 
students' assignments we noted there was a difference in the amount of 
reflection found in individual narratives. For example, some statements were 
rather &quot;dry&quot; and did not provide much more than an enumeration of chronological 
steps in their search process. In contrast, some other statements provided very 
detailed accounts of students' thoughts and feelings experienced during the 
search process, but were less specific about the particular order in which the 
search steps were performed. The format and scope of data presented below 
reflects these differences. </p>

<p>Our first task regarding analyzing the students' information-seeking 
strategies was to identify the order in which they used specific types of 
information resources. Due to the limits of the data collection, we were able to 
analyze the order of the resource use for only the first two search steps. 
Twenty-two of the 25 participants identified in their narratives the first two 
resources they have used. Sixty-five percent (15) of the students started their 
search with a company website, while the remaining 35% (7) started with search 
engines (2), print resources (3), and government websites (2). The second step 
in the search process for the majority of students (54%, 12) was to use online 
databases. </p>

<p>We also identified the combinations of first and second resource use in the 
students' search strategies. The largest number of students (36%, 8) first used 
the company website and then searched the commercial databases. A distant 
second combination was company website (first step) and search engine (second 
step), performed by 14% (3) students. There were seven other types of 
combinations for first and second resources (e.g., print/company website, search 
engine/online databases, etc.) that were present in the strategies of only one 
or two students. </p>

<p>Besides analyzing the content of the students' search narratives for patterns 
in the order of the resource use, we also looked for themes that described 
students' information-seeking activities. Three themes were identified: 
exploration, verification, and haphazard search approach. The themes were 
confirmed in a follow-up interview with the students. </p>

<h4>Exploration </h4>

<p>The most dominant theme in the beginning stage of the search process was 
students' need to gain more understanding about the companies that were focus of 
the CI assignment. These exploratory search activities were also used to confirm 
that the company name that was provided is actually a correct and complete name 
of the company, and to get a general sense what kind of information may be 
available. The initial stage was characterized by the use of very simple search 
techniques, such as browsing in various areas of the company website and 
typing the company name in the search window of a search engine. Some exemplary 
comments indicate students need to &quot;get acquainted&quot; (participant #20), &quot;to gain sense&quot; (#23), and to &quot;get educated&quot; (#19) about the topic of their research. A notable outcome of this exploration stage was a sense of surprise with the amount of relevant information the students were able to find. The most illustrative 
statement of this experience is: &quot;Little did I know that the company site would 
end up having a great deal of information I needed.&quot; (#25) </p>

<h4>Verification </h4>

<p>Once the baseline information had been collected, the students' next major 
activity was to verify the currency and accuracy of the information. Students 
were primarily concerned about the trustworthiness of the information that they 
collected on company websites. As one student summarized it: &quot;Information on 
corporate websites must be regarded with some skepticism.&quot; (#21) While the need 
to verify information collected on the Web was explicitly mentioned by eight 
students, many others performed search activities from which we could imply that 
their focus was on verification. These activities primarily occurred in the 
fee-based online databases and were characterized by more structured use of 
search techniques, including selection of specific databases and formulation of 
advanced search queries (e.g., use of the Expand command on company name field 
in Dialog). In contrast to the positive feelings of surprise that accompanied an 
unexpected amount of information available on the company website, students were 
rather reserved about the outcomes of their online database searches. Their 
comments revealed many unsuccessful attempts to retrieve any relevant 
information, and retrieval of information that was a duplicate of information 
they had already collected. Here are two illustrative examples: </p>


<blockquote>&quot;Next I performed a XY (online service name omitted) search, eager to use the 
information I received in the class from XY demonstration. Unfortunately, 
although XY is an excellent resource for company information, it only had a few 
news articles. I searched all the company information folders..., but nothing 
was returned from my queries.&quot; (#3) <br><br>
&quot;After compiling all the information from Nexis/Lexis and Dialog, I found 
that most of the information, especially business alliances and press releases, 
was already on the XY website.&quot; (#11) </blockquote>

<p>Our overall impression is that the verification stage was not a productive 
and emotionally rewarding experience for the students searching for CI on 
Internet start-up companies. </p>
<h4>Haphazard search approach </h4>
<p>A theme that was consistent throughout all of the students' narratives was a 
lack of linearity in their information collection strategies. Students reported 
taking leads from one source to find information elsewhere, such as finding an 
older version of the company's name that was then used in a successful trademark 
search (#21) and finding additional contact information for the company by 
following a link for the trade association membership (#12). The students also 
commented on &quot;pulling together&quot; information from various sources in order to 
complete their report. An excellent summary of the haphazard nature of the 
search process is provided in this statement: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;...doing this research was very much like putting a puzzle together. I took 
tiny bits of information from one source and used them to find more information 
elsewhere. I also felt that I stumbled over very useful information, especially 
in browsing through news articles, that led me in new directions I had not 
thought of originally.&quot; (#16)</blockquote>



<h2>Discussion </h2>
<p>According to our study findings, free Web-based resources proved to be the 
most frequently used and the most useful sources of secondary information for 
addressing competitive intelligence questions on small Internet start-ups. In 
particular, the students relied on information found on the websites of the 
companies they were researching, thus supporting statements by <a href="#kas99">Kassler</a> (1999) 
and <a href="#liu00">Liu</a> (2000) that a company website may serve as a chief source for 
competitive information. The study participants relied on the company website 
as their main and most successful source in finding not only the general company 
information, but also for finding information about their company's corporate 
alliances and sources of venture capital funding. </p>

<p>It is not surprising that study participants turned away 
from the more traditional business information resources. A majority of them 
anticipated that print-based resources would be too outdated to contain 
information on new companies, and therefore selected not to use them at all. The 
participants who did attempt to use print resources failed to find the 
information needed. As it was indicated in the follow-up interviews, students' 
expectation that print resources had information they needed was very low and 
they turned to these resources &quot;just in case&quot; some information may be available. 
We speculate that students' willingness to spend their search time on resources 
that have minimal likelihood for success may have been influenced by the 
educational nature of the CI assignment, which was the context for this study. 
That is, because the students experienced this CI assignment as an &quot;educational 
activity&quot; they were less concerned about the efficiency of their search approach 
then they might have been in a real life CI collection situation. </p>

<p>Despite the fact that students found much of their information on the company website, many were reluctant to accept the information found on this 
resource without turning to sources that were perceived to be &quot;more 
trustworthy&quot;, such as fee-based online services. However, while Lexis-Nexis 
and/or Dialog were used by all but three study participants, the reported 
success rate with these sources was rather limited compared to students' overall 
success with the Web-based resources. The students' reluctance to rely solely on 
Web-based resources mirrors advice given by <a href="#gro00">Gross</a> (2000), <a href="#vib00">Vibert</a> (2000), and 
<a href="#kas99">Kassler</a> (1999) who encouraged information professionals to verify the 
information found on the Internet with more reputable sources. An interesting 
outcome of turning to fee-based online services was that many of the 
participants who used this approach concluded that the information initially 
found on the Web would have been sufficient. </p>

<p>This observation poses an interesting question. Certainly, it is advisable 
for information professionals to attempt to verify information found on the Web 
because it can be of questionable quality. But in the instance of finding 
competitive intelligence on small, Internet start-up companies, it may be 
difficult to find a neutral and a more reputable secondary source of 
information. These companies do not have to publicly disclose their financial 
documents, many of them have not made a national impact to be covered by the 
press; and many have not been in business long enough to establish credit 
references. If the more reliable, fee-based, online resources, such as 
Lexis-Nexis or Dialog, contain no information or provide the same information as 
the less reliable but free sources, such as the company website, how can 
information professionals be certain that their findings are accurate without 
turning to primary research? Or, to put it differently, if it is obvious that 
information cannot be verified in other secondary sources, should the 
information professional spend time and money on fee-based online searches at 
all? </p>

<p>Another relevant topic for discussion relates to the overall process for 
finding CI on small Internet start-up companies reported by participants in our 
study. First, they initiated their information search with the desire to get a 
&quot;quick picture&quot; and explore information that may be available. For the vast 
majority of respondents, the initial step was conducted at their company 
website. In this step, the students become in general more informed about the 
company that was the focus of their research. Rather than considering each 
assigned CI question individually, the participants chose to search for the 
information in a non-linear fashion. They visited a variety of resources as they 
were encountered in the research process and gathered whatever information they 
could from each, thus following advice by <a href="#gro00">Gross</a> (2000) to &quot;follow the links.&quot; 
This approach also mirrors <a href="#bat89">Bates's</a> (1989) &quot;berrypicking&quot; model for information 
seeking. The participants gathered their information by going to a variety of 
sources and choosing the most appropriate information from each. </p>

<p>The framework for finding information on small, Internet start-up companies 
is complemented by the elements from information-seeking models identified in 
the background section of this paper. The uncertainty and confusion experienced 
by many of the participants as they were trying to develop an overview of the 
company mirrors the task initiation stage suggested by Kuhlthau's (1993) model 
of the Information Search Process. As the study participants, in sometimes 
rather haphazard ways, continued to gather bits and pieces of information from 
multiple resources, they provided support for <a href="#mar97">Marchionini's</a> (1997) statement that the &quot;information-seeking process can proceed along parallel lines of 
progress and take advantage of opportunities arising from intermediate and 
random results.&quot; (p. 51) The format of data collection procedures did not allow 
us to collect more specific data on the nature of this opportunistic and random 
acquisition of information. However, many individual comments provided by 
students indicate that they experienced a &quot;lack of control&quot; over the CI 
information they came across. For example, they were surprised by the content of 
information they found, or by the location of the information in the source they 
were using. The feelings that can be inferred from the students' comments are 
similar to the feelings associated with information encountering described by 
<a href="#erd97">Erdelez</a> (1997). Finally, in the concluding stage of their search for CI on Internet start-up companies, the students experienced a sense of relief and 
satisfaction with the successful completion of the project, similar to the final 
stage of Kuhlthau's Information Search Process: search closure. </p>

<h2>Conclusion </h2>

<p>This study revealed some interesting findings regarding the types of 
secondary information resources used that can be used to find competitive 
intelligence on small, Internet start-up companies. The study also provided 
insight into the characteristics of the overall information-seeking strategies 
that are applied in this type of competitive intelligence research. </p>
<p>The participants of this study relied most heavily on web resources as a 
means for finding information. In particular, the website of the company being 
researched was the most useful resources for finding basic company information 
and for creating an overview of the company's activities. However, the 
participants questioned the reliability of the information provided in this 
resource, and attempted to verify it in fee-based online databases. The participants' 
success in these databases was limited, because much of the information was not 
available or was a mere duplicate of information found on the website. This 
finding indicates that it is difficult to rely solely on secondary research to 
find information on small, Internet start-up companies that does not in some 
form originate from the company itself. </p>
<p>The search strategies that emerged from the participants' research narratives 
suggest a potential framework for finding competitive intelligence information 
on Internet start-up companies when relying on secondary resources. This 
framework involves: </p>
<ol>
  <li><i>A broad and exploratory initial search</i> - conducted in a single 
  resource that promises to provide the most background information on the 
  company being researched. Presently, a company website is the best source 
  for this type of information for small, Internet start-up companies. However, 
  depending on the organization of the website this information may be either 
  readily accessible or more cumbersome to uncover. After an overall view is 
  gained, it is easier to see what types of information should be gathered from 
  other sources. </li>
  <li><i>Following leads to other sources</i> - as opportunities arise, bits and 
  pieces of information are gathered from other sources. Also, information 
  collected on the company website (e.g., additional search terms or alternate 
  spellings of the company's name) is used to increase the quality of searching 
  in other resources, especially fee-based online databases. </li>
  <li><i>Completing the picture</i> - by focused searching in specialized 
  resources (e.g., specialized websites, online databases) to fill the missing 
  gaps in the information initially collected from the website and, if possible, 
  verifying this information. </li>
</ol>
<p>This study was an attempt to investigate the characteristics of resource 
usage and information-seeking processes in the context of using secondary 
information resources to collect competitive intelligence on small, Internet 
start-up companies. The major limiting factor of the study is the 
“artificiality&quot; of the study context. The study is based on CI activities of 
students in the context of a class assignment, not on the behaviour of actual 
information users in a naturalistic setting.&nbsp; A more holistic view of the research topic 
will also have to take into account issues such as the individual differences of 
information seekers and the contextual dimensions of CI activities, especially 
the role of primary research. An important challenge for such a study would be 
the selection of data collection procedures that allow the study participants to 
express their search activities in a natural way and provide a sufficient level 
of structure for a successful research analysis and interpretation. </p>
<p>Finding competitive intelligence on small, private Internet start-ups 
presents not only interesting practical problems to business information 
specialists, but also creates an intriguing problem for researchers studying 
information user behaviour. While many current user studies focus on 
information-seeking behaviour in the context of information rich environments, 
the above problem provides researchers with a unique opportunity to learn about 
strategies users apply when little information is available. Future research on 
this topic will contribute to both the practice of competitive intelligence and 
the theory of human information behaviour. </p>

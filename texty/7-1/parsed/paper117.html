<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The <span>storage</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>capacity and use of databases has increased at the same rate as advances in the new information and communication technologies.  Extracting relevant information is, as a result, becoming quite a complex task.  This 'panning for gold' process is known as <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>Discovery in Databases - KDD.</p>

<p>KDD can be regarded as the process of discovering new relationships, patterns and significant trends through painstaking analysis of large <span>amounts</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of stored data.  This process makes use of recognition technologies using <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and mathematical patterns and techniques.  Data mining  is one of the techniques used to carry out KDD.  Specific aspects of the <span>technique</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>are: the <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and creation of knowledge, processes, <span>algorithms</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>for recovering potential knowledge from data stocks (<a href="#norton">Norton, 1999</a>).</p>

<p>The discovery of knowledge in databases, KDD, is regarded as a wider <span>discipline</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>'data mining' is seen as a component concerned with the methods of discovery and knowledge (<a href="#fayyad">Fayyad <i>et al.</i>, 1996</a>).</p>

<p>The application of data mining permits <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the premise of turning data into information and then into knowledge.  This <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>makes the <span>technique</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span><span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to the decision -making process. In order to achieve this result it is necessary to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>the effective use of knowledge obtained by data mining in the decision -making process and the impact it has on the effective <span>resolution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of problems and on planned and executed actions.</p>

<p>This study intends to demonstrate the application of the data mining <span>technique</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> using as a case study the DocTh&eacute;ses database, a catalogue of French theses.  The study focuses on theses dealing with Brazil and includes also theses by Brazilians defended in France.  The <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>studied is 1969 -1999. The <span>parameters</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the study were:</p>

<ol type="1">
	<li>Occurrence of theses related to Brazil by subject areas;</li>
	<li>Thesis supervisors identified with certain subject areas; </li>
	<li>Geographical <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of cities hosting institutions where the theses were defended; </li>
	<li>Frequency by subject area in the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>when the theses were defended between 1969 and 1999.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The data mining process</h2>

<p>Included in the concept of data mining (DM) are all those techniques that permit the extraction of knowledge from a mass of data which would otherwise remain hidden in large databases.  In the first stage of DM we have pre-processing, in which data are collected, loaded and 'cleaned'.  In order to do this successfully, it is necessary to know the database, which involves understanding its data, the cleaning process and preparation data in order to avoid <span>duplication</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of content as a result, for example, of typing errors, different forms of abbreviation or missing <span>values</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Data mining <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>identify all the possibilities of correlation that exist in databases.  By means of data-exploration techniques it is possible to develop <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>that can extract from the databases critical information with the aim of providing maximum possible assistance in an organization's decision-making procedures.</p>

<p>The concept of data mining, according to <a href="#cabena">Cabena et al. (1997)</a> is: the <span>technique</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of extracting previously <span>unknown</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information with the widest relevance from databases, in order to use it in the decision-making process.</p>

<div align="center">Figure 1: Diagram of data mining technique</div>

<p>Figure 2 shows the logical placing of the different phases of decision -making with their potential value in the areas of tactics and strategy.  In general, the value of information to support the <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of a decision increases from the lower part of the pyramid towards the top. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>decision based on data in the lower levels, in which there are usually millions of data items, has little <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>value , while that which is <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>by highly abbreviated data at the upper levels of the pyramid <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>have greater strategic value.</p>

<p>By the same <span>token</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> we find different users at the different levels.  An administrator, for example, working at an operational level, is more interested in daily information and routine operations of the 'what' type, found in records and databases at the bottom of the information pyramid.  This information creates data.  On the other hand, <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>analysts and executives responsible for showing the way forward, creating <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and tactics and supervising their execution, need more powerful information.  They are concerned with trends, patterns, weaknesses, threats, strong points and opportunities, market intelligence and technological changes.  They need 'why' and 'and if' information.  They need internal and external information.

<p>A general view of the stages involved in DM is shown in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>3.  The process starts with a clear definition of the problem  - stage 1, <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>by stage 2, which is the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>process aimed at identifying all the internal and external sources of information and selecting the sub -group of data necessary for the application of DM, to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>with the problem.  Stage 3 consists of preparing the data, which includes pre -processing, the activity that involves the most effort.  It is <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>into visualization <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and data reformatting <span>tools</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> which make up 60% of DM, a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>illustrated in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>4.  This preparation is <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>for the final <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the results and because of this, the <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>used are very important.  The <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>used at this stage must be capable of performing many different procedures, such as adding <span>values</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> carrying out conversions, filtering variables, having a format for exporting data, working with <span>relational</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>databases and <span>mapping</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>entry variables.  In general these stages resemble the information cycle or the information management process carried out within the thematic area of Information Science, particularly in the information retrieval process.</p>

<p>We now pass on to stage 4 in the analysis of results obtained through the DM process, two basic aspects of which have to be con0ered: giving information about new discoveries and presenting them in such a way that they can be potentially exploited.  In this phase the participation of an expert in the area of databases is recommended in order to answer specific technical questions that may influence the analysis.  Business managers and executives may be involved at this stage.</p>

<p>By applying data mining we may achieve various <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge discovery.  Among these, the discovery of associations, discovery of groupings, discovery of classifications, discovery of forecasting rules, <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>hierarchies, discovery of sequential patterns, and discovery of patterns in categorized segmented and time series, which are found in <a href="#alvares">Alvares (2000)</a>.</p>

<h2>Case <span>Study</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>for the Application of Data Mining</h2>

<h3>Database</h3>

<p>The Database chosen to study data mining was DocTh&eacute;ses, the catalogue of theses defended in French <span>universities</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> This catalogue is the responsibility of the Agence Bibliographique de l'Enseignement Sup&eacute;rieur  - ABES, connected to the Department of Research and Technology of the French National Ministry of Education and its aim is to supply the University Documentation System, to locate and register the documentary resources of higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>libraries and also to monitor the regulation of cataloguing and indexing texts.</p>

<p>The DocTh&eacute;ses database is available on <span>CD</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>-ROM and the year 2000 version was used for this study.  Theses that had Brazil as their research <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>were extracted.  The total <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>was 1,355 theses (bibliographic records), among which were also included all theses written by Brazilians and defended in France between 1969 and 1999.</p>

<p>The format for each bibliographic <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(occurrence) <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>the following structure:</p>

<p>We chose to study various tendencies in procedure, created and chosen by means of applying the Dataview  bibliometric  <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>which will be the object of commentary and analysis in <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span><span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of this study.</p>

<h3>Simplified Methodology</h3>

<p>After the data preparation stage in which Infotrans Version 4.07 <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>was used, and once the working database had been prepared, we began data mining using Dataview, bibliometric <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>for extracting trend indicators developed by the Centre de Recherche R&eacute;trospective de Marseille  - CRRM of the Aix -Marseille III University, St. J&eacute;rome Centre, Marseilles, France.</p>

<p>Dataview is based on bibliometric methods whose ultimate objective is to turn data into intelligence for decision -making by creating elements for <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis.  To achieve this, reformatting data is a basic <span>condition</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>for bibliometric treatment.  After <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis the information retrieved will have a decisive influence on generating knowledge and intelligence, a process in which two aspects will be con0ered.</p>

<p>Both value and validity of information will have a decisive influence in the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>for knowledge in databases (KDD). This is the philosophy which must <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>any study concerning data mining as well as generating knowledge. When applying Dataview it became obvious the  importance  of  the previous phase of preparation of data (data cleaning) done with Infotrans. The <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of  the data generated by Infotrans did result in  clear results from the bibliometric analysis.</p>
  
<p>In <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>5 we present the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of Dataview in a bibliometric study. Another important characteristic of the Dataview <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>relates to the measurement characteristic of bibliometry <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>on <span>numerical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>bases which in their turn are created by using occurrences.  Thus, for each unit of bibliographic element, occurrence must be dealt with in three ways, a) <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>state  - simple location of occurrences, presence or absence of <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>elements, b) condensed state  - <span>expansion</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of these occurrences or frequencies, and c) co -occurrence, which represents the <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and condensed states. In this way lists will be created  - occurrence frequency and co -occurrence and frames  - frameworks of presences and absences (<a href="#rostaing00">Rostaing, 2000</a>).</p>

<p>To gain an understanding of data it is important to know the three basic <span>laws</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of bibliometry:</p>

<p>1) Bradford's <span>Law</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(or the <span>Law</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of Dispersion): concentrates on the repetitive behavior of  occurrences in a specific field of knowledge.  Bradford chose periodicals for his analysis because of their <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of occurrence of themes and tendencies, and found that few periodicals produce many articles and many periodicals produce few articles.</p>

<p>2) Lotka's Law: <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>writers' scientific production, that is, it measures the contribution of each of them to scientific progress.  Lotka's <span>Law</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>states the following: the number of writers who produce n works is in the proportion of 1/1 raised to n2 of writers who produce only one work;</p>

<p>3) Zipf's Law: is called the fundamental quantitative law of human activity.  It is sub -divided into Zipf's First <span>Law</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>which relates to the frequency of words appearing in a text (number of occurrences of words).  It is <span>controlled</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>by the following mathematical expression:</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p117Zipf.gif" width="115" height="45" border="0" hspace="50" vspace="10"></div>

<p>Where K = constant; <span>R++</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>= word order, and F = word frequency.</p>

<p>Zipf's Second <span>Law</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>identifies low-frequency words that <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in such a way that several words show the same frequency (<a href="#tara95">Tarapanoff, <span>Miranda</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>& Ara&uacute;jo Jr., 1995</a>).</p>

<p>For this study, we shall look at the Zipf <span>curve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in the light of the <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>below:</p>

<p>According to <a href="#quoniam92">Quoniam (1992)</a>, on the Zipf <span>curve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>we have: </p>

<p>Zone I  - Trivial information : defining the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>themes of the bibliometric analysis;</p>

<p>Zone II  - Interesting information: found between Zones I and II and showing both peripheral topics and also potentially innovative information.  It is here that technology transfers related to new ideas should be con0ered, and</p> 

<p>Zone III  - Noise: characterized by <span>containing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>concepts that have not yet emerged in which it is <span>impossible</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to say whether they will emerge or if they will remain merely <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>noise.</p>

<p>As France, together with <span>Germany</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> has one of the most important and longstanding <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of sociology, it is therefore a favorable location for the elaboration of academic studies in this area, as is shown in Graph I.  The same is true of economics, where we also find a strong interest in <span>Latin</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>American topics.  These are topics that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>researching Brazil look for and are of <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>interest.</p>


<h3>Thesis supervisors identified with certain subject areas</h3>

<div align="center"><strong>Table 1: Thesis supervisors identified with certain subject areas</strong></div>

<p>In terms of the area of technology, France is one of the world leaders in technological development, having an efficient system of technological innovation that justifies its position in the rankings of this field of research. Of the supervisors <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in these areas, Table 1 shows that production is concentrated around those lecturers who together account for 20%, 18% and 7.1% of the total number of theses defended.</p>

<p>It should be pointed out that the areas analyzed were those in which the numbers of Brazilians in France grew during the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>up to 1994, after which time there was a decline in demand.</p>

<p>Zone II  - Interesting information, in its turn, represents those areas that are emerging, which is indicated by the areas of <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> medical sciences, <span>Latin</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>American studies and history, which have been increasing in popularity since 1995.  Some of the facts that have been creating interest in these areas of study are found in the influence of the new scientific and technological dimension as is the case of the areas of <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and medicine, which are constantly affected by new discoveries and technologies that <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>them forward in the field of human knowledge.  In the case of history, the fact of our living in a <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of abrupt transition in this type of society, forces us to engage in a <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>re -reading and <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>continually for <span>explanations</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>concerning new aspects of this society.</p>

<p>Within the area of history, Fr&eacute;deric Mauro stands out, because among all the supervisors, he supervised the greatest number of thesis between 1969 and 1999, with 25% of the total relative to the first group of supervisors (Zone II  - interesting information), as Graph 2 illustrates.  This <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>results fundamentally from the strong influence of French historiography in Brazilian academic life.  In the 1930s, a group from France, composed of several lecturers from different areas, brought to Brazil the eminent teacher Fernand Braudel, one of the creators of the first founding generation of the French School of Analysis which still contains important <span>figures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in historiography such as Marc Bloch and Lucien F&eacute;bvre. At this time, as a result of the French visit, the <span>History</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>Department of the University of S&atilde;o Paulo was <span>founded</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> an event that began the decisive influence of French historiography in Brazil.  In the particular case of <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>Fr&eacute;deric Mauro, his great influence in this <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of historiography, together with that of Georges Duby and Jacques Le Goff, among others, <span>belongs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to the second generation.</p>

<p>As a result of the facts mentioned above we may state that not only does the number of thesis supervised by Mauro account for the significant number of works noted in the area of history, but that this is also clearly due to the fact that French historiography has been the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>catalyst for the interest of Brazilian historians seeking training abroad.</p>

<h3>Concentration of defended thesis by French cities</h3>

<p>When we looked at the careers of researchers in France, the result was Graph 3, the results of which <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>that 62% of defended theses were presented in Paris.  Of the remaining 40%, Montpellier, Toulouse, Marseilles, Grenoble and Bordeaux accounted for 50%.  The remaining approximately 50% were in 30 other French towns.</p>

<br>
<h3>Period of Presentation of Theses between 1969 and 1999</h3>

<p>By analyzing Table 3 we find that between 1974 and 1978, only the area of <span>Law</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>achieved high levels of interest, the greatest concentration that was found relative to all the other areas.  This <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>is noticeable and may be explained in part by the political circumstances prevailing in Brazil during the 1970s.</p>

<p>The coincidence of the high level of concentration of theses defended in France with the peak of the military dictatorship in Brazil from 1967 raised the level of interest in understanding the state of law imposed there, especially in relation to the citizen's basic rights and guarantees.</p>

<p>In the area of linguistics, it will be seen that it peaked between 1980 and 1984, with a tendency to recapture interest after 1995.</p>

<div align="center"><strong>Table 3: Incidence of Subject Areas by Periods of Years (1969  - 1999)</strong></div>

<p>By and large, in relation to the number of thesis defended during the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in question, we may note that since 1996 the number has been falling rapidly, as may be seen in Graph 4.  The reason for this is perhaps found in the fact that since 1999 there has been uncertainty about grants for overseas study in the areas of humanities and social studies, which has meant that the area of technology alone does not reach high levels as the whole.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that in the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of relative equilibrium in the <span>curve</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> which oscillates between 36 and 58 theses defended between 1980 and 1990, an average of about 47 theses were defended each year, with the field of economics being especially <span>prominent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>during this <span>period</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>In the field of information sciences, twelve thesis were defended between 1974 and 1999. The <span>golden</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>age was between 1980 and 1984, with a total of five thesis.

The other five, each responsible for one thesis, were P. Albert, M. Menou, M.

He has developed a wide -ranging consultancy <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in Brazil in conjunction with the Instituto Brasileiro de Informa&ccedil;&atilde;o em Ci&ecirc;ncia e Tecnologia  - IBICT, linked to the Brazilian Government's Ministry of Science and Technology.</p>

<p>With <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to Zone III  - the so -called zone of noise, in spite of its not yet having <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>emerging concepts and because it is not a very conclusive area, it must be systematically monitored since it can show, or at least allow, in the analysis of weak signals, the <span>inference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>interests in training and research.  Thus we should not dismiss it a priori.  In this zone are found <span>art</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and archaeology, literature, political science, science and technology, philosophy, administration, information science and communication studies, among others.</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The analysis of the DocTh&eacute;se database in relation to retrieving the word 'Brazil' by means of data mining, was revealing with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to the chosen subject areas, related supervisors, chronological <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>concentration of theses defended and cities chosen.</p>

<p>Discovery of knowledge occurred gradually as the data mining process took shape.  In the first stage  - defining the problem  - it was decided to explore the database related to Brazil both by key -word and by <span>origin</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of supervisor.  The second stage  - cleaning the data  - brought about the first contact with the data, extracting only those of potential interest in discovering a pattern.  In the <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>stage  - carrying out the data mining per se  - it was decided to use the Dataview <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>which already had embedded in its system <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>rules and the ability to visualize data to find knowledge.  The first <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>come from this phase, in <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>with the aim of the research.  The fourth stage  - analysis of data  - new associations were created and knowledge emerged.</p>

<p>The results obtained are an illustration of how national organs for encouraging research and training high -level human resources, such as the Coordena&ccedil;&atilde;o de Aperfei&ccedil;oamento do Pessoal de N&iacute;vel Superior (CAPES), and the Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq) can <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>their investments into areas of knowledge that are felt to be relevant, by means of knowledge discovered in databases. On the academic 0e the Brazilian Federal Universities already started to use data mining in laboratorial research and consultancy work using several softwares, among them Clementine (<a href="#spss">SPSS, 2001</a>).</p>

<p>Although the utilization of data minig in Brazil still is in its initial phase, in the governmental and productive sector there are signs of its application. The Brazilian Programme of the Industrial Technological Prospective (Programa Brasileiro de Prospectiva Tecnol&oacute;gica Industrial) makes use of the methodology of Technology Foresight, and uses data mining  on historical and current data bases to foresee probable futures.</p>

<p>The <span>figures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>obtained and their application reinforce the aims of the data mining process by turning data into information and being used in the decision -making process of organizations that take decisions related to the preservation of and innovation in knowledge. Although economics, sociology and history are not priority areas for development in Brazil, they are <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to an understanding of the <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the Brazilian economy, society and history, which have been <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span><span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>by France from the point of view of theoretical and cultural orientation.  These areas should continue to receive investment.  The impact of this influence was seen in the Exhibition of the Re -Discovery of Brazil (2000), where many <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>written by French travelers indicated their presence and influence in the country.  Other areas such as technological sciences should be examined because they are diminishing, while areas in <span>expansion</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>should be examined from the point of view of elaborating bilateral technical, cultural and economic co-operation agreements.</p>

<p>It is <span>impossible</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>with all the implications concerning political, technical, economic and cultural agreements that may be <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>through analyzing databases of the kind studied here. Other bases from other sources and other countries would provide different possible implications.</p>

<p>It is possible that the present article might be the start of a series dealing with the <span>rise</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of interest in research in Brazil and other countries that seeks <span>parallels</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and discovers knowledge from the results found by applying data mining as an effective managerial tool.</p>

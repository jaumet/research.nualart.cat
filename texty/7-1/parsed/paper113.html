<p style="margin-left : 50px; margin-right : 50px;"><em>&quot;Given the increasing pace of accumulation of medical knowledge, the only surety is that today's knowledge is obsolete tomorrow. Instead of being masters only of <span>memorization</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> physicians must become masters of acquiring necessary information from many sources in a timely enough fashion to make correct clinical decisions. The amount of knowledge necessary to practice high-quality health care is just too large and changing too rapidly to be carried around in any <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>s brain.&quot;</em><br>
					(<a href="#Becher">Becher & Chassin</a>, 2001, p. 74)</p>


<p>Although <a href="#Becher">Becher and Chassin</a> (2001) refer specifically to physicians in the above passage, their blunt, but astute, assessment applies to all those who are responsible for the provision and management of health care. In order to improve <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and minimise <span>error</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> health care organizations must become proficient in acquiring necessary information from many sources in a timely fashion in a rapidly changing <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Effective scanning may be one way to accomplish this.</p>

<p>What is meant by &quot;scanning&quot; can vary depending on the type of information, the reasons for which it is <span>sought</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and the frequency and scope of the information gathering (see <a href="#Choo">Choo</a>, 1998: 74-75). For example, Choo describes environmental scanning as the &quot;acquisition and use of information about events, trends, and relationships in an organization's external <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> the knowledge of which would assist management in planning the organization's <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>course of action&quot; (1998: 72). This includes information activities related to identifying opportunities and threats in a for-profit <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Active environmental scanning is associated with <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>differences in <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations  (<a href="#Aguilar">Aguilar</a>, 1967; <a href="#Choo">Choo</a>, 1998; <a href="#Yasai-Ardekani">Yasai-Ardekani</a>, 1996) and hospitals (<a href="#Subramanian">Subramanian</a>, 1994; <a href="#Thomas">Thomas <em>et al.</em>, </a>, 1993).</p>

<p>A somewhat more focused form of scanning may be usefully <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to health care organizations and their need to anticipate potential patient safety issues. Health care risk management is <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to operate in a pre-emptive <span>mode</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> identifying risks to safety and hazards and implementing preventive <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>before injuries are incurred (<a href="#Harpster">Harpster &amp; Veatch</a>, 1990).  One goal is to avoid adverse events, defined as unintended injuries caused by medical management rather than the <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>condition</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the patient. Examples include hospital-acquired infections, medication errors, and surgery on the <span>wrong</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>0e or limb. An adverse event attributable to <span>error</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is a &quot;preventable adverse event&quot; (<a href="#Kohn">Kohn <em>et al.</em>, 1999: 24</a>). Scanning could play an important role in the process of learning from adverse events and risk management by sensing and identifying adverse event information as part of an organizational &quot;early-warning system&quot;. Scanning in this context could be defined as the <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and use of information about adverse events, patient safety risks, hazards, and trends from an organization's external <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> the knowledge of which would assist health care providers and managers in <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>preventive <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>where necessary. For this to be successful, however, we need to understand what facilitates or impedes the recognition, evaluation, and transfer of such information and knowledge. The aim of this paper is to begin to lay the theoretical ground work for questions and tentative hypotheses which may guide <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>research. First I will set the context and <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the theoretical and <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>importance of the issue. This is <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by a review of relevant research, which leads to a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for con0eration of scanning for and learning from adverse event information. I will then continue by describing three constructs based on organizational <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>which I <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>may influence scanning and vicarious learning from adverse events. These constructs form the basis of three tentative hypotheses.</p>

<h2>The context of the issue</h2>

<p>In several large-scale studies researchers have estimated that approximately 3% to 10% of inpatient admissions result in some form of medically-related injury, half of which were preventable (<a href="#Brennan">Brennan</a> <em>et al.</em>,  1991; <a href="#Leape">Leape <em>et al.</em>, 1991</a>; <a href="#ThomasEJ">Thomas <em>et al.</em>,  2000</a>; <a href="#Vincent">Vincent <em>et al.</em>, 2001</a>). Recent high-profile publications have decried this <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as unacceptable and have prompted understandably urgent calls for immediate <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#Cook">Cook <em>et al.</em>, 1998</a>; <a href="#National">National Patient Safety Foundation, 1998</a>; <a href="#LeapeBerwick">Leape &amp; Berwick, 2000</a>). One suggested intervention is the development of adverse event reporting <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> These would allow open sharing of the incidence and <span>causal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>factors to promote inter-organizational learning and prevention (<a href="#Kohn">Kohn, Corrigan, & Donaldson</a>, 1999). In the United States, the Agency for Healthcare Research and <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(AHRQ) recently issued a research agenda for medical errors and patient safety. It includes two very pertinent questions: &quot;How can useful information be provided effectively to those who can act (e.g., consumers, providers and provider organizations, purchasers, states, and oversight organizations)?&quot; and &quot;How can we encourage the adoption and use of safety information?&quot; (<a href="#Meyer">Meyer <em>et al.</em>, 2001: xvi</a>).</p>

<p>From a pragmatic vantage point, there are <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>incentives to avoid severe clinical adverse events: multiple and potentially very high costs, including death or disability for the patient, emotional and financial distress for the family, <span>consequences</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for the caregivers involved (regulatory or disciplinary; reputational; stress; possible job loss), damage to staff morale, litigation costs for the hospital, damage to organizational reputation, and erosion of institutional legitimacy. Given these potentially high costs, one could expect to find evidence that hospitals optimize opportunities to learn how to avoid such occurrences. This would include thorough <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of and learning from internal mishaps, as well as scanning the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for possible information about risks and events experienced elsewhere. Scanning and vicarious learning could be much more efficient and intuitively appealing <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as the hospital may be able to <span>derive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the lessons learned yet avoid the adverse event costs incurred by the other hospitals.</p> 

<p>Although we do not yet have national <span>error</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>reporting <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in Canadian health care <a href="#1">(1)</a> such as the ones <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by the aviation industry, there are other potential sources of information in the health care <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>  The sources <span>naturally</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>vary in formality, detail, and <span>accuracy</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> At one end of the <span>spectrum</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are inquest reports and recommendations, malpractice litigation <span>findings</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and medical <span>equipment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>hazard alerts which are produced by judicial <span>bodies</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and monitoring agencies.  <span>Clinical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and professional journals provide another <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>  The other end is quite informal and includes incidents described in stories spread by word of mouth between health care providers.  Media reports, including newspaper, radio and television accounts, may be perceived as falling somewhere in between.  Understanding how hospitals currently use various sources to learn from others' experiences with adverse clinical events and exploring what organizational <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>facilitate efficient and effective transfer of learning is of <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>relevance to health care managers in the face of increasing demands for improvement and accountability. </p>

<p>The <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of vicarious learning by hospitals from the mishaps of others is of theoretical interest as well. <a href="#Sitkin">Sitkin</a> (1992) proposes that an organization's own failures provide important lessons and experience necessary for adaptation. Although he doesn't elaborate further, Sitkin also suggests that <span>failure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>may be helpful to other organizations vicariously, that is, they may benefit from observing the outcomes of others' failures. <a href="#Huber">Huber</a> (1991) describes the processes through which organizations acquire information or knowledge, including searching, scanning, and vicarious learning, &quot;about which relatively little has been learned beyond the fact that [it] occurs&quot; (p. 107).  There is little theory and <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>research <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on this <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the health services research literature, so it is not clear whether hospitals systematically scan for adverse event information and knowledge, what factors may impede or facilitate transfer, or whether in fact hospitals do learn from others' failures. As there is little theory or <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>studies that are <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of hospitals' vicarious learning from adverse clinical events, I have used organizational and population-level learning theory  (<a href="#Argote">Argote, 1999</a>; <a href="#Hedberg">Hedberg, 1981</a>; <a href="#Miner">Miner &amp; Haunschild, 1995</a>; <a href="#MinerKim">Miner <em>et al.</em>, 1999</a>; <a href="#Sitkin">Sitkin, 1992</a>) as the theoretical foundation.  <span>Concepts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>from the literature on organizational <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and information orientation (<a href="#Choo">Choo, 1998</a>; <a href="#Ocasio">Ocasio, 1997</a>; <a href="#Subramanian">Subramanian <em>et al.</em>, 1994</a>; <a href="#Thomas">Thomas <em>et al.</em>, 1993</a>), as well as inter-organizational knowledge transfer and innovation (<a href="#ArgoteIngram">Argote &amp; Ingram, 2000</a>; <a href="#ArgoteIngramLevine">Argote <em>et al.</em>, 2000</a>; <a href="#Darr">Darr &amp; Kurtzberg, 2000</a>; <a href="#Greve">Greve &amp; Taylor, 2000</a>), are also incorporated into the theory base of this paper.</p>

<h2>The effect of organizational experiences on others</h2>

<p>Although there is a substantial literature on organizational learning, surprisingly little of this has been about learning from others' failures. <a href="#MinerKim">Miner <em>et al.</em></a> (1999) point out that even fewer studies have looked at organizational <span>failure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as an independent variable. They proceeded to study the effects of <span>failure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>events (organizational deaths, very poor financial <span>performance</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> or <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by another firm) on the types and mix of routines in populations of firms.  They describe four general categories of organization-level reaction: imitating routines of more successful organizations; avoiding the <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>routine or organization; developing a new routine; and reinforcing a failing routine. They also identified possible population-level responses such as creation of a new industry <span>entity</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and routine, or industry-level co-operation or regulation. Miner <em>et al.</em>'s dependent variable is &quot;change in routines,&quot; not the <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>outcomes for the organizations. Their model does not predict whether the changes will result in positive or negative effects, although they state, &quot;at its broadest level, our work argues that patterns of prior organizational failures will substantially influence the survival and prosperity of remaining organizations&quot; (p. 212). As another example, <a href="#Ingram">Ingram and Baum</a> (1997) found that cumulative industry operating experience and competitive experience (failures) affect the <span>failure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>rates of US hotel <span>chains</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>  </p>

<p>The observations from <a href="#MinerKim">Miner <em>et al.</em>, </a> (1999) and <a href="#Ingram">Ingram and Baum</a> (1997) <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that failures, which perhaps could include significant adverse events <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>a patient deaths and inquests, may have an effect on other hospitals by enabling the transfer of some form of knowledge.  Although Miner <em>et al.</em>,  (1999) and Ingram and Baum (1997) studied aspects of learning from others, they did not <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on how organizations pay <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the experience of others in the first place. Paying <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to cues from the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is a precursor to experiencing effects from others and an information-based approach to the process could provide some guidance.</p> 

<h2>A <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for con0ering scanning for adverse event information</h2>

<p>Huber provides an information-based view of organizational learning and identifies four component processes: knowledge <span>acquisition</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> information <span>distribution</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> information interpretation, and organizational memory (<a href="#Huber">Huber, 1991</a>). He describes the sub-processes through which organizations acquire information or knowledge, including vicarious learning ("acquiring second-hand experience"), searching, and scanning, (p. 96). Focused <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>implies that a specific problem is driving the pursuit of information. Once a &quot;good enough&quot; answer is found the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>may stop, which <a href="#MarchSimon">March and Simon</a> (1993) called "satisficing". The nature of scanning implies a more generalised and persistent information need, to keep abreast of ongoing changes or new ideas in a field or <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>  Adapting <a href="#Choo">Choo's</a> (1998: 86) conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for environmental scanning, we can modify the basic components to <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for con0ering scanning for adverse event information (Figure 1).</p>


<div align="center"><img src="p113fig1.jpg" width="504" height="496"></div>

<div align="center"><b>Figure 1.</b> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for adverse event information scanning</div>

<p>Choo's <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>includes information needs, seeking, and use as part of scanning behaviour. Information needs for health care risk management are potentially very broad, ranging from risks related to diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and hospital-acquired infections to <span>equipment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>hazards and drug <span>interactions</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>  Information about adverse events related to these risks and hazards experienced in other organizations likely could be useful  for vicarious learning. </p>

<p>With <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to information seeking, it would be interesting to know who scans, what sources, and how <span>frequently</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> in order to know how to facilitate the endeavour. Many staff may play an informal boundary-spanning role, acting as conduits from external sources of risk and adverse event information. Health care professionals have become highly specialised over time, which may mean that discipline-specific knowledge and experience are required to scan effectively.  Specialisation may also create barriers and compartmentalisation of information and knowledge (<a href="#West">West</a>, 2000). Given the increasing workload of front-line care providers, they may have little time available for general scanning, and by sheer necessity their information seeking may be restricted to highly focused, problem-driven searching.</p> 

<p>In environmental scanning, information is used for strategic planning and decision making.  In the case of adverse event information, the <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>application is risk management and improvement activities. The risk information has to be evaluated to gauge its relevance and applicability within the particular organization. The process may vary markedly in <span>rigour</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and formality, depending on who makes this judgement and how (i.e., based on what criteria). Many health care organizations have designated risk managers and/or risk management departments and committees. However, given the diversity of specialities and the sheer <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of potential adverse event information, it is unlikely that these entities alone could manage the floodgates. Assuming that some risk information passes the relevance <span>test</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> the organization still has to muster the resources, ability, and will to do something about the identified risk or hazard, in the face of many other <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>demands.</p>
  
<p>A descriptive study of these scanning behaviours related to adverse event information in hospitals would be a useful starting point.  In addition, there are three constructs or sets of organizational <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that may be quite relevant based on  organizational theory and information studies research:  a) organizational <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and information <span>focus</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> b) organizational affinity, and c) absorptive capacity of the organization. These constructs may influence whether and how effectively health care organizations scan for adverse event information and learn vicariously.</p> 

<h3>A. Organizational <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and information focus</h3>

<p>Although it may seem rather obvious, the effectiveness of scanning and vicarious learning <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on organizational alertness to events and changes. If health care providers and managers are not paying <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the external <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> useful information about risks and hazards may go unnoticed and the potential opportunity for learning may be <span>lost</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>  

<p>Researchers highlight the importance of information processes linking the organization to its external <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#Choo">Choo</a>, 1998; <a href="#Hedberg">Hedberg</a>, 1981; <a href="#MacDonald">MacDonald</a>, 1995; <a href="#Stinchcombe">Stinchcombe</a>, 1990). <a href="#Moorman">Moorman</a> (1995), for example, demonstrates the effect of organizational information processes on new product development.  She emphasizes  &quot;the importance of having an external orientation that motivates the need for information and an internal orientation that fosters effective transmission and utilization&quot; (1995, p. 328).  She describes information <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or awareness that has <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and intensity.  Where and how an organization directs its gaze may be dictated by the types of issues it takes for granted as being important. <a href="#Corner">Corner <em>et al.</em></a> (1994) define <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as a <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on information and they state that an organization's attentional capacity is <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by its routines for gathering information or scanning. Likewise, <a href="#Rulke">Rulke <em>et al.</em></a> (2000) study particular learning channels for acquiring external information. They describe <span>relational</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>learning channels based on personal contacts and relationships, and <span>non-relational</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>learning channels, such as knowledge dissemination through journals, for example.</p>

<p><a href="#Ocasio">Ocasio</a> (1997) develops these ideas further with his attention-based theory of the firm. He suggests that an organization's <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to cues from its <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by the organization's <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>structures and procedural and communication channels. His theory is based on three <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>principles. First, the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is selective and <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on what issues preoccupy organizational members at the time. As <a href="#Turner">Turner and Pidgeon</a> (1997) aptly note, &quot;a way of seeing is always also a way of not seeing&quot; (p. 49), so there is always the potential that important information may be overlooked or not recognised.  Second, <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is also situated because the organizational and environmental <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in which the organizational members find themselves shape their <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and how they <span>respond</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Third, the structural <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> suggests that organizational members are placed in particular <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>based on the way issues and responsibilities are allocated within the organization. &quot;Each local activity within the firm involves a set of procedures and communications, and these procedures and communications <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of decision-makers on a selected set of issues and answers&quot; (<a href="#Ocasio">Ocasio</a>, 1997: 191). Consequently, a health care organization's <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>structures, procedures, and communication channels all may influence 1) who scans, 2) what types of risks, hazards, and events are noticed,  3) how <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>scanning takes place, and 4) how the information is processed.</p>

<p>Attention could also be <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by the customary ways in which information is generally valued and handled in an organization. <a href="#Marchand">Marchand <em>et al.</em></a> (2000) describe this <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as information orientation, the composite of a company's capabilities to effectively manage and use information.  Information orientation is comprised of three categories of practices: information technology, information management, and information behaviours and <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#Marchand">Marchand <em>et al.</em>, 2000</a>). The latter category includes (p. 71):</p>

<p>These studies together <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that there are differences in organizations' <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on information, that is, their propensity to gather information, the nature and effectiveness of their information routines and attentional <span>mechanisms</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and their <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information use. The differences in this inclination may affect their awareness of and <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to external adverse event information, which leads to the following hypothesis:</p>

<p style="margin-left : 50px; margin-right : 50px;"><b>HYPOTHESIS 1:</b> Health care organizations with a stronger external information <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>may show greater organizational learning in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to other organizations' adverse events than health care organizations with a weaker external information <span>focus</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>B. Organizational Affinity </h3>

<p>Studies of knowledge transfer and innovation in and between firms provide insights into another construct that may influence the effect of  external adverse event information on other health care organizations, which can be labelled as affinity <a href="#2">(2)</a> between organizations. <a href="#ArgoteIngram">Argote and Ingram</a> (2000) summarize several such studies, commenting that information is transferred more readily between organizations in <span>network</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> alliance, or franchise relationships. For example, <a href="#Darr">Darr<em>et al.</em></a> (1995) found that knowledge or experience (as reflected in the unit cost of pizza production) transferred to other stores within same-owned <span>chains</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> but not to other-owned franchises. <a href="#DarrKurtzberg">Darr and Kurtzberg</a> (2000) describe how store managers rely on strategic similarity to chose knowledge transfer partners because of a better match with problems experienced, rather than store proximity or customer similarity. Networks have been found to promote sharing and adaptation among private colleges (<a href="#Kraatz">Kraatz</a>, 1998) and biotechnology firms (<a href="#Liebeskind">Liebeskind <em>et al.</em>, 1996</a>; <a href="#Powell">Powell <em>et al.</em>, 1996</a>).  <a href="#Greve">Greve and Taylor</a> (2000) found that geographic proximity of firms to an innovating firm increased the likelihood that they would make changes as well. Consequently, affinity, such as similarity in organizational <span>characteristics</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> proximity, and <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>through networks or alliances, may affect scanning for and transfer of adverse event information.</p>

<p>Affinity by itself, however, is unlikely to be <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to enable organizational learning on its own; it is more likely that it provides hospitals that have a stronger information <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>greater awareness and access to necessary information. </p>

<p style="margin-left : 50px; margin-right : 50px;"><b>HYPOTHESIS 2:</b> The relationship between information <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and organizational learning will be stronger for health care organizations that have a higher affinity with one experiencing an adverse event than will health care organizations with a lower affinity.</p>

<h3>C. Absorptive capacity</h3>

<p><a href="#Cohen">Cohen and Levinthal</a> (1990) coined the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot;absorptive capacity&quot; to describe an organization's ability to exploit external knowledge in innovation processes. They assert that this ability to recognize the value of new information, assimilate and apply it <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the level of the firm's prior related knowledge. The same may be true of a health care organization's ability to scan effectively for risk or hazard information. Two types of prior related knowledge or experience may be necessary for a hospital to successfully use such information. First, the organization must develop self-knowledge (<a href="#Rulke">Rulke <em>et al.</em>, 2000</a>), that is, familiarity with its own strengths and weaknesses, and capabilities. This allows the organizational members to know what types of information to be alert to when scanning. This also <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>safety imagination, the creative ability to anticipate where and how processes may break down (<a href="#Turner">Turner &amp; Pidgeon, 1997</a>; <a href="#Westrum">Westrum, 1992</a>). </p>

<p>Second, the health care organization's ability and skills in improvement may influence whether risk or hazard information is successfully used to change practice. <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>improvement methods (<a href="#Langley">Langley <em>et al.</em>, 1996</a>) and skill in their application to clinical improvement (<a href="#BerwickNolan">Berwick &amp; Nolan, 1998</a>) could facilitate learning from adverse events experienced by others and risks identified through scanning. Improvement knowledge includes understanding health care delivery as a system (<a href="#Nolan">Nolan, 1998</a>); developing and <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>changes (<a href="#Berwick">Berwick, 1998</a>); knowing what and how to measure (<a href="#NelsonMohr">Nelson <em>et al.</em>, 1996</a>; <a href="#NelsonSplaine">Nelson <em>et al.</em>, 1998</a>); and the role of interdisciplinary co-operation (<a href="#Clemmer">Clemmer <em>et al.</em>, 1998</a>). Following such methods may increase the <span>probability</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that the right changes will be made to address patient safety risks, and that the changes will <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>achieve <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>outcomes.</p>

<p>This variant of absorptive capacity, which is comprised of the organization's self-knowledge of its strengths and weaknesses, and its improvement capabilities, may act as another factor which differentiates organizations' scanning and vicarious learning:</p>

<p style="margin-left : 50px; margin-right : 50px;"><b>HYPOTHESIS 3:</b> Health care organizations with a greater absorptive capacity will show greater organizational learning in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to other organizations' adverse events than health care organizations with less-developed absorptive capacity.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The intent of this paper was to extend the concepts of scanning and vicarious learning from <span>failure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the realm of clinical adverse events and hospitals. Vicarious learning is &quot;second-hand&quot; learning derived from the experience of other individuals or organizations. Scanning in this context is defined as the <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and use of information about adverse events, patient safety risks, hazards, and trends from a health care organization's external <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> the knowledge of which would assist health care providers and managers in <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>preventive <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>where necessary. Scanning for such information and making improvements before patients are injured could be an efficient and effective way for health care organizations to learn vicariously and avoid incurring the costs of adverse events themselves. This is easier said than done, however, and there are gaps in our knowledge of how to facilitate the process.</p> 

<p>We need to understand more about information behaviours related to scanning for and use of adverse event information. As depicted in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>1, this includes information needs, seeking, and use and the multiple factors which may influence scanning and vicarious learning. Three constructs in particular are suggested for con0eration. Organizational <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and information <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>may affect how alert a health care organization is to risk and hazard information. This construct <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to an organization's propensity to gather information, the nature and effectiveness of its information routines and attentional <span>mechanisms</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information use. Second, organizational affinity, such as similarity in organizational <span>characteristics</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> proximity, and <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>through networks and alliances, may promote greater awareness of and access to information. Finally, absorptive capacity is comprised of the organization's self-knowledge of its strengths and weaknesses, combined with its improvement skills and capabilities. Absorptive capacity may help health care providers and managers know what <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information to scan for, and may increase the likelihood of successful implementation of improvements.</p>

<p>These preliminary hypotheses offer a starting point for increasing our understanding of the effect of attentional <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and information <span>focus</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> as well as the influence of organizational affinity and absorptive capacity, on the <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and transfer of adverse event and risk information. They could pave the way for further exploration of the <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and processes by which adverse event information can be effectively used by  hospitals. This would <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>squarely within the AHRQ's research agenda for medical errors and patient safety (<a href="#Meyer">Meyer<em>et al.</em>, 2001</a>).  </p>

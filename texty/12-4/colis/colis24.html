<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Live-action, role-playing games (LARPs) are a type of pretence play where participants
  are physically present in the activity (<a href="#bre05">Brenne
  2005</a>). The players play characters, artificial personas, within a pre-described
  fictional environment, and experience the results of such play through that
  character. How players relate to their characters varies from participant to
  participant, and the same player may also vary his or her character relationship
  during play (<a href="#har07">Harviainen
  2007</a>). Some LARPs contain a very strong narrative structure, others next
  to none. They may or may not be competitive, and are often created to facilitate
  enjoyment, medial functions, or both (<a href="#mor07">Morton
  2007</a>). Regardless of whether it is played only once or multiple times, and
  whether it is a singular work or a part of a continuity, each LARP is a unique
  event, environment and information system (in the sense of system-that-informs;
  <a href="#buc91">Buckland 1991</a>).
  Yet most of them share strong similarities and tendencies. This paper is a brief
  introduction to the similarities that concern information behaviour. Some LARPs
  do not share all of the traits or phenomena presented here, but, being exceptions
  to the norm, are beyond the scope of this article (for key variables see <a href="#mon07">Montola
  2007</a>).</p>
<p>LARPs contain several extraordinary information-related traits. So, from the
  perspective of library and information science, they are worth studying not
  because they are now a commonplace phenomenon, but rather because the LARP environment
  provides insight into phenomena not normally available for LIS study. The most
  important of these are an exceptionally visible social contract regulating communication
  and document access, an environment where invented information may freely take
  the place of documentary knowledge, and the presence of cognitive subject representations.
  LARPs therefore work as useful test environments for observing the impact of
  culture and environment as well as personal attitudes on information behaviour.
  In this, they visibly include all of the factors listed by Steinerova (<a href="#ste01">2001</a>)
  as influencing information communication and use.</p>
  
<h2>Information and the magic circle of LARP</h2>

<p>A live-action role-playing game takes place in an artificial temporary reality,
  a play-space, created by a social contract. In LARP studies, this area is given
  a multitude of names and definitions, but, for the sake of convenience, I will
  refer to it as the &quot;magic circle of play&quot; (<a href="#hui39">Huizinga 1939</a>; <a href="#sal04">Salen &amp;
  Zimmerman 2004</a>). Within that space players ignore and re-signify events and
  elements in a way consistent with the game's needs (<a href="#lop04">Loponen &amp; Montola 2004</a>).
  The reality is maintained by a group of semiotic processes aimed to preserve
  the illusion that the area is completely autonomous, and game participants act
  as if it were the only reality (<a href="#poh04">Pohjola 2004</a>). Yet, due to being a space imposed
  upon a real place (as per <a href="#aar01">Aarseth 2001</a>), and inhabited by participants practicing
  differing forms of pretence play (<a href="#har07">Harviainen 2007</a>), the temporary reality is
  only pseudo-autonomous. The edge of the magic circle is a very clear information
  system boundary, one that affects but does not necessarily restrict the movement
  of information through it (<a href="#mer04">Merali 2004</a>).</p>
<p>It is because of these two traits, the illusion of autonomy and the fact that
  it is indeed an illusion, that LARPs (and certain of their sibling phenomena;
  see <a href="#mor07">Morton 2007</a>) are an important exception in the way information behaviour
  works. For example, in a typical fantasy LARP every participant pretends that
  they are new, real people within a new reality, not fictional personas in a
  fictional game environment. For the duration of play, the fantasy world is the
  &quot;real&quot; world, the &quot;only&quot; world for them. This is the illusion
  being preserved. However, at any point where there is an information gap - or
  player misbehaviour - that illusion is threatened. As knowledge of a world can
  never be complete, the gaps are unavoidable (as per <a href="#wil77">Wilson 1977</a>), and the artificiality
  of the game world further increases the likelihood of encountering such gaps.
  Nothing exists beyond the social contract to prevent the players from seeking
  information from sources that are not within the illusory reality. Yet the social
  pressure to preserve the illusion intact is very high, leading to potential
  conflict between participants favoring different types of information behaviour
  (<a href="#har07">Harviainen 2007</a>).</p>
<p>In addition to this players have definite tendencies to favor certain types
  of information while playing, as they presume that doing so makes the game more
  rewarding to them (<i>ibid</i>). During LARP play, game participants exhibit both typical
  search behaviour, such as favoring information sources based on their proximity
  and reliability (as per <a href="#wil06">Wilson &amp; Walsh 1996</a>), and exceptional choices made
  to preserve or improve the game experience. These are further influenced by
  continuity issues, such as whether the game is a part of a series of LARPs or
  a one-session game (for definitions on what qualifies as a one-session game,
  see <a href="#fra01">Frasca 2001</a>).</p>
<p>Information sources for each LARP exist on two levels. The great majority of
  them exist outside the <i>diegesis</i>, the &quot;sum of all that is real within the
  game&quot;. Before the LARP, and sometimes also during it, the players appropriate
  material from these <i>extradiegetic</i> sources and transform that material into elements
  and forms that are able to exist within the diegesis without endangering the
  illusion of reality required for functional play. In order to understand how
  this process works, it is essential to analyse the core traits of the sources
  and the way players access them.</p>
<h2>Information sources in LARPs</h2>
<p>Most, in many cases all, of the directly game-related formal documents are
  prepared and distributed by the game master(s), the person(s) responsible for
  creating, preparing and running the game. As these three game mastering functions
  differ in the way they influence play, I have divided the concept of &quot;game
  master&quot; into Design, Preparation and Control. The first two exist before
  play, the third during play but outside it. The effects of all, however, carry
  over into the diegesis. It is common that the three functions are actually the
  same person(s), but that is neither mandatory nor significantly affects information
  behaviour during play. The major exception to this, the strongly influencing
  conflict of Controls, is explained in the section diegetic information below.
  A few LARPs do not have a game master at all, instead dividing Design and Preparation
  among the players and replacing Control with group arbitration (<a href="#sva05">Svanevik 2005</a>;
  <a href="#har06">Harviainen 2006</a>).</p>
<p>The following source descriptions are based on an idealization: in theory the
  documents described below should contain all of what is attributed to them;
  in reality, they more likely than not have flaws, omissions, discrepancies and
  points that can be significantly misinterpreted. Throughout play the game participants
  encounter situations where these problems cause information needs, but are unable
  to directly address those needs without endangering or breaking the magic circle
  for themselves, others, or both. This is one of the key reasons why studying
  information behaviour in LARPs provides insight into library and information
  science issues that are not normally encountered elsewhere, such as the effect
  of invented, fictional information in environments where no corresponding factual
  data exists and where it may thus come into free conflict with other invented
  information.</p>
<h3> Extradiegetic and pre-game information</h3>
<p>Extradiegetic material provided by Design consists of four sets of documents:
  setting material, character material, genre information and game mechanics.
  These four may overlap in some parts, or add material to each other. Normally
  the great majority of such material exists in the form of formal documents shared
  by several players. Setting material ideally contains all the necessary information
  required to understand the temporary reality where the LARP takes place, such
  as social structures, culture, religion language, even physical issues (<a href="#fat05">Fatland
  2005</a>). In reality, it is impossible to define those elements to a perfect
  level, so there are always information gaps in the material. In addition to
  this, those documents may contain normal flaws, as described above. Design may
  also include other information sources, such as movie references or internet
  documents created by people not connected to the game in any way, into the setting
  material. Much <i>fabula</i> (seeds for potential narratives) are often introduced
  into play beforehand as parts of the setting itself (<i>ibid</i>). </p>
<p>Character material is also typically created as a (set of) formal document(s).
  It contains what the player knows about the character's history, social connections
  and personality. It may or may not include information about other characters,
  setting information not given to other players, and personal seeds of narrative.
  In some LARP cultures, such as the German mainstream, players usually write
  their own characters. These are then accepted, modified or rejected by Design
  (<a href="#jor07">Jordan 2007</a>). In others, Design creates the characters (<a href="#fat05">Fatland 2005</a>). This
  difference in approach strongly affect the game's information traits: the less
  fabula, shared background or even diegesis-compatible information in general
  Design is able to include in the character documents, the more has to be included
  in the setting material in order to achieve functional play.</p>
<p>Fabula, whether prepared in advance or emergent during play, are essentially
  Design's attempts to guide information seeking and use - the narrative currents
  - during play. As in all information systems, the organizer(s) of information
  have no way to exactly anticipate who will search for what information in that
  system, but they usually do have an inkling about what sorts of inquiries are
  likely to happen (<a href="#buc91">Buckland 1991</a>). From a library and information science perspective, LARPs exemplify highly
  complex systems, while from a mathematical point of view they are closer to
  chaotic than complex systems (<a href="#mon04">Montola 2004</a>). The ability to weave a good narrative
  matrix for a LARP is therefore a form of organizing information to facilitate
  certain search patterns and give them successful results. This is accomplished
  by using a set of incentives that guide play by making some actions more likely
  to happen than others (<a href="#fat05">Fatland 2005</a>).</p>
<p>Game mechanics is a type of document that contains all the necessary rules
  and conflict resolution systems that the LARP is expected to need or that will
  be essential to have in case they are needed. In some LARPs these cover all
  forms of interaction, in others they are limited to provide safe play at risk
  points, typically sexual contact and physical violence. Game mechanics also
  cover issues such as pre-determined play time, rules on breaking game continuity
  and acceptable clothing and props.</p>
<p>Genre information is usually included in one of the abovementioned documents.
  In a LARP context, the word is used to denote a certain style of play, usually
  an emphasis towards certain sorts of narrative build-up, expected from all game
  participants. Examples of genre affecting information behaviour during play are
  a soap opera LARP's rule that every secret must be brought into the open, in
  as dramatic a manner as possible, and a murder mystery's rule that no character
  will leave the location, rationalizing a reason to stay, so that all of the
  plotlines will stay within the play-space.</p>
<p>Design itself is also an information source, one that is frequently accessed
  by players before the game. Both Design and Control are a special type of source,
  <i>directive</i> source, that has the power to override any other information source
  as it regards the LARP. Therefore if a directive source and a formal game document
  come into conflict, the directive source effectively &quot;rewrites&quot; the
  contents of that document, even if no actual changes to the document are made.
  This is typically done in order to preserve or improve functional play, but
  may, in cases where there is more than one member involved in either Design,
  Control, or both, lead to a conflict between differing information sources.
  This is especially problematic in cases where communication lines before or
  during the LARP break down and participants start acting upon incompatible information.</p>
<p>Preparation is strongly intertwined with design, but must be treated as a separate
  entity due to the fact that especially in large-scale games (100+ participants)
  the two positions are usually handled by different people. Preparation is in
  charge of making the playing area (the place upon which the play-space is imposed)
  as close to the play-space's attributes as possible. The duties of Preparation
  may also include placing prepared documents (formal or otherwise) within the
  area, so that players can later appropriate their content into the diegetic
  frame.</p>
<p>One set of significant extradiegetic information sources exists outside the
  control of Design: the other players. While it is possible to influence how
  much and what information the participants share, true regulation is impossible.
  In many cases such contact is welcome, as it creates stronger contact networks
  and helps smooth out problems in advance, but there is always the risk of unwanted
  information leaking from one player to another. This is especially important
  in cases where shared knowledge of certain narrative issues would endanger functional
  play.</p>
<h3> Diegetic information</h3>
<p>Before the LARP begins, and sometimes during play, players appropriate material
  from the extradiegetic sources, and build new, temporary documents based on
  that appropriation. The new material is never identical to what was in the original
  documents, due to both the influence of the now active magic circle and the
  nature of the act of appropriation itself. The players do not copy the information
  into the diegesis, they interpret the originally alien material into a form
  they can use (as per <a href="#ric91">Ricoeur 1981</a>). Most important of these appropriation-created
  elements is the character.</p>
<p>From an information studies perspective the character is actually a subject
  representation of the documents it was created from, just one that is given
  cognitive form. That there are also psychological, social and ludic aspects
  to the character (<a href="#lie06">Lieberoth 2006</a>, <a href="#hen05">Henriksen 2005</a>, <a href="#mon07">Montola 2007</a>) is, for this
  elementary LIS approach, unimportant (see <a href="#der03">Dervin 2003</a> for criticism, though).
  While constructing that cognitive form the player appears to create it mostly
  out of explicit subject data concerning only that character, but the same process
  also inevitably adds much information about other diegetic elements into the
  mix. From the player's perspective all of that information is implicit subject
  data. However, as Design has intentionally included that data into the material,
  it is, in reality, explicit subject data as well (<a href="#hjo97">Hj&oslash;rland 1997</a>).</p>
<p>Similarly, documents placed within the playing area by Preparation are represented
  in the play-space, instead of existing within it. The requirements of the game's
  temporary reality function as the indexing language such representations use,
  and the participants' interpretations of the reality and the representations
  influence the way they personally re-index those elements (as per <a href="#mai01">Mai 2001</a>).
  Practically all subject representations in LARPs, both environmental and cognitive,
  are of the predominantly content-oriented kind (<a href="#soe85">Soergel 1985</a>; <a href="#hjo97">Hj&oslash;rland
  1997</a>), as they are primarily constructed by the players in charge of them, i.e.
  people with no direct duty to provide easy access to them for other participants.</p>
<p>Therefore the inside of the magic circle is, in actuality, a pseudo-closed
  information system where the characters make information searches upon information
  sources, i.e. environmental elements and other characters. It is possible for
  a player (but not the character) to also access the actual documents outside
  the system, but this is a breach in both continuity and the illusion of the
  play-space. Furthermore, as many of the documents can only be accessed by the
  player who is handling (playing) the subject representation (character), it
  is not even possible for others to access those through a filter other than
  Control or that player.</p>
<p>Information seeking is a significant part of all types of role-playing games,
  LARPs included:</p>
<blockquote><i>[O]ne may also note that the goals that the character and the player
  share require acquiring knowledge about the environment in order to achieve
  these goals. This information might involve relative locations of potential
  achievement loci, names of places or people that are themselves achievement
  loci, relevant abilities and how they interact with the 'realities' of the world
  of the fantasy frame, as well as other knowledge.</i> (<a href="#hen06">Hendricks
  2006</a>.)</blockquote>
<p>To complete tasks, the characters need information. All information behaviour
  that takes place during play is effectively added to the characters' personal
  histories, including passive encountering and even non-executed searches. Thus
  a kind of &quot;commentary&quot; of implicit subject data is added into the
  subject representations, eventually leading to them covering much other information
  besides the appropriated data from the initial extradiegetic documents. As the
  commentaries expand, several representations start to refer to each document,
  leading to the game becoming a system with multiple index entries (as per <a href="#buc91">Buckland
  1991</a>). Some of these representations may be inaccurate, or may contain accurate
  information while distributing misleading representations of it.</p>
<blockquote><i>Two points are fundamental to these representations. First, they
  are only representations. They describe and should not be confused with what
  they describe. A statement that the moon is made of green cheese does not cause
  the moon to be made of green cheese. Second, even if the description were accurate
  at some time, it does not follow that the accuracy will continue.</i> (<a href="#buc91">Buckland
  1991</a>.)</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, it is possible for players to avoid information searches completely
  by inventing substitute information to replace any missing information. This
  has the advantage of more fluid play, but may lead to several conflicting &quot;truths&quot;
  existing within the diegesis. As there may not be any way (excluding a direct
  override from Control successfully conveyed to every single participant) to
  confirm which of these truths is accurate, they may disrupt play. In a more
  typical information environment such issues rarely carry as much importance,
  and even if they do, the facts can be checked and corrected from reliable sources.
  In contrast, there may be no way to change the course of a LARP once, for example,
  the king is <i>known</i> (as opposed to <i>believed</i>, a situation that can be easily solved
  by defining one answer as &quot;rumors&quot;) to be both dead and alive at the
  same time. This is especially disruptive in cases where information from two
  members of Design and/or Control comes into conflict.</p>
<p>Another variable that exists in some LARPs is the acceptance of mundane information
  sources as diegetic sources. In such a game it is, for example, possible for
  the characters to perform online searches. Again, those sources are appropriated
  into the diegesis through the characters' personas, making the results different
  from their real-world counterparts. Some games blur the line even further, effectively
  replacing the magic circle with something closer to a common interpretative
  frame shared by the players (<a href="#ste07">Stenros, Montola &amp; Waern 2007</a>). As this happens,
  the game loses its nature as a unique information system, transforming into
  a variation of normal-life practices. Thus, from a LIS perspective, those so-called
  <i>pervasive games</i> are a different phenomenon, despite their similarity to live-action
  role-playing games.</p>
<h2>Play as a search, encountering and retrieval environment</h2>
<p>Understanding the chaotic structure of the LARP information system is only
  the first step towards modeling information behaviour in such environments. A
  second, highly significant step is a comprehension of the way information searches
  function, and are executed, in such an environment. While defining such activity
  is far beyond this article in scope (see <a href="#har07">Harviainen 2007</a>, for an initial foray
  into that field), it is necessary to analyse some of its key aspects here.</p>
<p>As the level of LARP play discussed here is a form of documentary communication
  between active, self- aware subject representations, it shares the general traits
  of such communication. As Suominen (<a href="#suo97">1997</a>) notes, it is thus a semiotic process
  where the manifested processes follow the essential attributes of the documents
  (such as language), but where it is also possible that the participants intentionally
  use only one selective point of view for interpreting the communication. This
  is especially prevalent in LARP environments, due to both the magic circle requiring
  constant semiotic re-signification to maintain (<a href="#lop04">Loponen &amp; Montola 2004</a>)
  and the fact that the primary interpretative filters, the characters, are also
  the most significant parts of the documentary communication.</p>
<p>In LARPs, the phenomena Wilson and Walsh (<a href="#wil96">1996</a>) call &quot;intervening variables&quot;
  play a very prominent and clearly observable role. Interviews I have conducted
  on 31 experienced LARPers in 2006-2007 about their information behaviour for
  my forthcoming doctoral dissertation show highly differing preferences about
  information sources and personal characteristics (in the LIS use of the term).
  Players and their characters are also affected by social/interpersonal barriers
  (out- and inside the diegesis, respectively), sometimes to the extent where
  an out-of-game social barrier will prevent otherwise logical in-game behaviour.
</p>
<p>Two of the barriers have already been the subject of some research in LARP
  studies: Geographic barriers, especially the distance to Control and certain
  key characters, manifests as a part of what Fatland (<a href="#fat05">2005</a>)
  calls the &quot;Fog of LARP&quot;, the impossibility of Design and Control to
  maintain complete control or even oversight over all aspects of the game. Likewise
  the effect of time on play behaviour, including information, is very strong.
  In what Faaborg (<a href="#faa05">2005</a>)
  calls the &quot;game over factor&quot;, many players start ignoring diegetic
  logic as the LARP nears its end, i.e. change one or more of their risk/reward
  priorities (<a href="#wil96">Wilson
  &amp; Walsh 1996</a>). Real-world cultural barriers, in contrast, seem to have
  next to no effect on information behaviour during play (<a href="#har07">Harviainen
  2007</a>), but within the diegesis - as the impact of characters' cultures -
  cultural variables are just as active or inactive as they would be for similar
  people in normal life. And, as noted above, variables of information source
  access and reliability play a very prominent part in the in-game behaviour.</p>
<p>The significant presence of information behaviour during play is one of the
  essential factors setting LARPs apart from other complex forms of pretence play
  such as psychodrama, re-enactment or sexual roleplay. This ties in with the
  narrative matrix of the LARP: even in a very elementary game, the contact of
  characters and information sources (in character form or not) is what changes
  the play from pretence activity to LARP. To take a very basic example, in Raasted
  &amp; Andersen's (<a href="#raa04">2004</a>) introductory LARP for children the activity is transformed
  from walking around with boffer swords to an actual story by the participants
  getting conflicting information from two wizards played by adults.</p>
<p>For functional LARP play, all four of the information acquisition methods delineated
  by Wilson and Walsh (<a href="#wil96">1996</a>) are necessary: passive attention, passive search,
  active search and ongoing search. They represent significant parts of player
  interaction. Sufficient passive attention and passive searches have been shown
  to increase the amount of playable material to all players (<a href="#har07">Harviainen 2007</a>),
  leading to improved communication and eventually a move towards autopoiesis
  within the system. The two active forms are not by themselves enough.</p>
<p>Information behaviour in LARPs is also influenced by participant experiences.
  Knowledge of useful play (including information seeking) patterns translates
  from one game to the next. The application of such patterns depends on game
  considerations such as genre. The same goes for the way players learn to re-signify
  the game environment through experience and customs while avoiding sign-pattern
  dissonance (for the essential traits of re-signification zones, see <a href="#del88">Deleuze
  &amp; Guattari 1988</a>). Analysed as a whole, LARPs thus form a (group of) knowledge
  domain(s), and exemplify the connection between information and semiotic interpretation
  Brier (<a href="#bri04">2004</a>) calls &quot;cybersemiotics&quot;. To study that level of connections
  is, however, beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>Regardless of the seeking orientation of a LARPer, functional play is a pleasure-giving
  form of activity (<a href="#har07">Harviainen 2007</a>). For this to happen, however, the player's
  own needs have to be answered and a suitable level of illusory otherness must
  be sustained. As information seeking, in the form of goals, quests and/or character
  interaction form a significant part of the first criterion, the process of information
  seeking itself in LARP environments often becomes autotelic, i.e. a self-rewarding
  type of activity, even when it does not lead to actual searching. However, if
  the game environment, fabula and/or character-based barriers conflict with the
  participant's information seeking capabilities or mental state (as per <a href="#ing05">Ingwersen
  &amp; J&auml;rvelin 2005</a>), the play becomes dysfunctional and no longer gives
  him or her pleasure. This in turn could potentially cause a cascade effect where
  too much of player-to-player/character-to-character support in the system breaks
  down and completely ruins the game, so it is in the interests of satisfied participants
  to try and support the information seeking of everyone else in addition to the
  maintenance of the illusory reality (<a href="#poh04">Pohjola 2004</a>). System integrity is thus
  preserved by player intent to enjoy the game.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It is possible to model live-action role-playing environments as information
  systems and analyse their components as parts of such a system. This is significant
  because such environments contain highly visible and occasionally even unique
  information elements and variables that make it possible to use LARPs to test
  theories on social information systems and information behaviour.</p>
<p>The game environment, being illusorily separated from the mundane reality,
  contains only representations of pre-prepared documents, while socially restricting
  or prohibiting access to the documents themselves. Therefore in such a system
  it is possible for information to mutate, both intentionally and unintentionally,
  in a way that makes even re-encounters with the same subject representations
  highly novel experiences.</p>
<p>As information behaviour in such an environment is pleasurable, participants
  actively encourage it and create more connections between the subject representations,
  thus making the LARP/system a self-organizing one. At the same time, however,
  play does not stagnate because most of the subject representations are in a
  cognitive form, as characters, and have sufficient reasons to occasionally withhold
  or distort the information they represent.</p>
<p>This article presents the key information traits of LARPs as systems, enabling
  further research into actual information behaviour in such environments.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>
  Recent workplace studies have 
  recast information literacy (IL) as a complex, sociocultural practice that is 
  discursively situated and constituted 
  through the connections and networks that exist between people, artefacts, 
  texts and bodily experiences. The process of becoming information literate 
  requires individuals to engage with a range of information modalities in 
  context. This engagement with information enables individuals to 'know' their 
  specific contexts in meaningful waysThrough 
  this knowing they develop subjective and intersubjective positions (<a href="#Lloyd_2007">Lloyd 
  2007</a>) in relation to their specific contexts. </p>
  <p>
  In all contexts IL is inextricably linked and 
  enmeshed with formal and informal learning and should therefore be of interest 
  to the library and information science (LIS) profession, particularly to those 
  who champion and facilitate IL. To understand how the phenomenon is played out 
  within a workplace context, researchers should focus their attention on how 
  knowledge about practice and professional theory are developed for the 
  practitioner in the process of their learning about work performance and 
  shaping workplace identity. </p>
  <p>
  The findings of two studies of firefighters 
  and ambulance officers in New South Wales, Australia are presented in this 
  paper. These studies suggest that our thinking about IL needs to be recast, 
  from thinking about IL as a skills-based literacy (<a href="#Bawden">Bawden 
  2001</a>), towards recognition of IL as a catalyst for meaningful learning in 
  all contexts. Such a move requires researchers to develop an understanding of 
  the complex ways IL manifests in context. This, in turn, 
  requires the adoption of a 'whole person' in the landscape approach (<a href="#Lloyd_2006">Lloyd 
  2006</a>). This recasting 
  of IL as a 'way of knowing' (<a href="#Lloyd_2003">Lloyd 2003</a>) brings 
  together interdisciplinary understandings of philosophy, sociology, adult 
  workplace education and librarianship.</p>
  <p>
  In this presentation I will argue that LIS 
  researchers should begin to move away from the Cartesian mind/body split, which 
  privileges mentalistic approaches to researching and describing IL and which 
  leads to IL being viewed within a normative framework. Instead, I suggest that 
  researchers must turn their gaze towards understanding the complex 
  sociocultural and embodied nature of information environments. By exploring 
  the relationships, interests and practices that shape workplace information 
  environments, researchers are better placed to understand the varied and 
  richly complex manifestations of IL.</p>
  <p>
  To know an information environment requires a
  <i>whole body in the landscape</i> approach (<a href="#Csordas">Csordas 1994</a>) 
  that recognizes the dynamic and complex relationship between physical, social 
  and cognitive information. Sociocultural and physical practices can facilitate 
  or restrict access to domain-specific knowledge and can result in the 
  development of subjective (knowing me) and intersubjective (knowing us) 
  positions in relation to a sense of place and of practice. </p>
  <p>
  Drawing on examples from ongoing 
  empirical research conducted with emergency services workers in Australia, I 
  will introduce a number of key concepts which should be carefully considered 
  when undertaking IL research. In doing so, I hope to illustrate that IL should 
  be seen as the signature discourse for LIS research, where it should be 
  explored as a situated sociocultural process which facilitates ways of 
  knowing. For LIS researchers the implications of this more dynamic approach 
  lie in the researcher's ability to feed back to the library profession 
  information that is grounded in and reflects the realities of praxis 
  (reflection on practice). </p>
  <p>Two major themes, <i>learning 
  to act</i> and <i>becoming a practitioner, </i>which have been drawn from the 
  empirical research into workplace IL, are described and address the following 
  questions:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 22.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  How is the information environment constituted for novice emergency service 
  workers?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What sociocultural processes are played out in learning about work 
  and the performance of work?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; How can IL be brought into view in the workplace?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; How is becoming information literate played out in the 
  relationships that exist within a workplace?<br/>
&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The paper then considers the 
  following final question:</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the key 
  concepts that form a conceptual framework for researching IL?</p>
<h2>  Redefining information literacy</h2>
  <p>There are numerous 
  definitions of IL (see <a href="#Bawden">Bawden 2001</a>, <a href="#Bruce">
  Bruce 1996</a>, <a href="#Bundy">Bundy 2004</a>, <a href="#Doyle">Doyle 1994</a>) 
  which are derived from library-based or educational research. In the majority 
  of these definitions IL is constructed and expressed as a skills-based 
  literacy. Most definitions focus on developing IL skills and attributes in 
  relation to codified sources of information available to learners through 
  texts in print or electronic form. </p>
  <p>Webber and Johnston (<a href="#Webber">2000</a>) 
  have suggested that most of these definitions centre on a range of common 
  skills and behaviours, such as information seeking, informed choices of 
  information sources, evaluation of sources, selection, ethical use and 
  presentation of information. This construct is underpinned by a Cartesian 
  dualist approach to learning, where the mind is privileged and separate from 
  the body. This approach silences a range of other information sources 
  including corporeal (body) learning.</p>
  <p>My recent studies, which have 
  been situated in the workplace (<a href="#Lloyd_2006">Lloyd 2006</a>), have 
  concluded that IL is more than just the ability to successfully engage with 
  codified forms of knowledge. The process of becoming information literate is 
  wholistic, as it involves the 'whole body' being in and engaging with a range 
  of information modalities, which are situated and influenced by the shared 
  experience of workplace participants. In this approach IL is a phenomenon that 
  facilitates knowing about an information landscape (<a href="#Lloyd_2006">Lloyd 
  2006</a>). In coming to know about the performance of work and professional 
  identity, people make connections and networks with the modalities of 
  information which are valued, but also contested, by the context. This work 
  has resulted in a reconceptualization of IL which can be redefined as:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 24.0pt">... a catalyst for learning and at the same 
  time inextricably enmeshed with learning. Information literate people have a 
  deep awareness, connection and fluency with the information environment. 
  Information literate people are engaged, enabled, enriched and embodied by 
  social, procedural and physical information that constitutes an information 
  environment. Information literacy is constituted through the connections that 
  exist between people, artefacts, texts and bodily experiences, which enable 
  individuals to develop both subjective and intersubjective positions. 
  Information literacy is a way of knowing the many environments that constitute 
  an individual's being in the world (<a href="#Lloyd_2007">Lloyd 2007</a>).</p>
  <p>In this recasting, IL is 
  viewed as a complex sociocultural process that acts as a catalyst in the 
  construction of meaningful frameworks which inform workplace practice. To understand how the phenomenon is played out requires researchers to 
  consider an approach which can be used to guide methodological explorations of 
  the phenomenon.</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
  <p>The research reported here is 
  situated within an interpretivist framework. It was influenced by symbolic 
  interactionism and social constructionism and employed the techniques of a 
  constructivist grounded theory approach (<a href="#Charmaz">Charmaz 2006</a>). 
  Symbolic interactionism places emphasis on the importance of taken-as-shared 
  meanings (understanding symbols, events, or actions in similar ways) and the 
  interpretation of meanings in the creation of reality. Social constructionism 
  focuses on social processes and how individuals seek to interpret or construct 
  meaning against the social, historical and political processes, which 
  influence the particular discourse with which actors engage (<a href="#Schwandt">Schwandt 
  2003</a>). Constructionists claim that:</p>
  <p style="margin-left: 24.0pt">We 
  invent concepts, models and schemes to make sense of experience, and we 
  continually test and modify these constructions in light of new experience. 
  Furthermore, there is an inevitable historical and sociocultural dimension to 
  this construction. We do not construct our interpretations in isolation but 
  against a backdrop of shared understandings, practices, language and so forth 
  (<a href="#Schwandt">Schwandt 2003, p. 305</a>)</p>
  <p>Constructivist grounded 
  theory method was employed in both studies. Unlike the traditional grounded 
  theory method of Glaser and Strauss (<a href="#Glaser">1967</a>), 
  constructivist grounded theory is not objectivist, in that it 'recognizes that 
  the viewer creates the data and ensuing analysis through interaction with the 
  viewed' (<a href="#Charmaz">Charmaz 2006</a>, p.131). Consequently the data 
  does not provide a window on objective reality, but is a negotiated 
  interpretation between the participants and the researchers about what 
  experiences are meaningful to their practice (<a href="#Charmaz">Charmaz 2006</a>).</p>
  <p>Two in-depth studies are 
  reported here. The first, a study of 14 firefighters was undertaken and 
  completed in 2005. The second, a study of 15 ambulance officers, is part of a 
  suite of ongoing studies that explore workplace information literacy. The 
  principle concern of both studies was to explore how each of these groups use 
  information and experience the training and working information environments, 
  and how this experience of information leads to the development of knowledge 
  and a shared sense of meaning about work and the performance of work. From 
  both studies some common themes and perspectives have emerged.</p>
  <p>Two stages of in-depth 
  face-to-face interviews of novices and experienced practitioners were 
  conducted. Participants were also observed in training and at work. In the 
  first stage of these studies, interviews were conducted to explore how the 
  novice or practitioner experienced the information environment and the types 
  of information required for learning about practice and for actual workplace 
  performance. The aim of the first stage analysis was to identify emerging 
  themes. A second phase of fieldwork was then undertaken to explore these 
  emerging themes. A feature of both studies was the high level of interaction 
  between participants and researcher at all stages of the study. Participants 
  were asked to review transcripts and provide comment. Participants were also 
  involved in discussions about the emerging analysis. </p>
  <p>The interpretation of IL 
  presented here is contextual, in that it is grounded in the experiences of 
  practitioners at various stages of their working lifeA consistent theme within this paper is that IL
  needs to be understood in the context in which it is played out.</p>
<h2>  Acting and becoming a practitioner in 
  the workplace</h2>
  <p>Two major themes emerged from 
  the firefighting and ambulance studies. These common themes reveal the 
  similarities of experience and use of information in the workplaces of 
  frontline emergency services practitioners. In the first theme, <i>learning to 
  act as practitioner</i>, outcomes of an experience with codified sources of 
  information are illustrated. The second theme <i>learning to become a 
  practitioner</i> illustrates how the changing experience with information 
  occurs when the novice moves away from the context-independent safety of the 
  training context and towards contextual engagement with the workplace 
  community.</p>
  <h2>Learning to act as a practitioner</h2>
  <p>Firefighters and ambulance 
  officers experience similar training environments. Both groups are often 
  called to work in high risk, critical and often dangerous situations. In early 
  stages of training, novices from both groups engage with an information 
  environment that is deliberative and protective (<a href="#Flyvjberg">Flyvbjerg 
  2001, p. 10</a>). This environment is context-independent, because it is 
  removed from the realities and uncertainties of actual workplace practice.&nbsp; 
  Both groups must undertake formalized competency based training, which is 
  assessable against the specific standards of each of the employing service 
  organizations. In this preparatory stage of training, both groups must engage 
  with codified sources of information. This information is abstract, 
  generalizable, reproducible and, therefore, 
  assessable. Novices learn to recognize factual information and behaviours that 
  are relevant to the acquisition of skill. However, because preparatory 
  training occurs away from the workplace, this recognition and experience of 
  information occurs without reference to concrete situations. Novices engage 
  with this information in order to learn the rules, regulations, procedures and 
  sanctioned practices of their service organization. Performance is evaluated 
  against the existing statements described by rules, regulations, training 
  manuals and competency based assessments. The outcome of this engagement is 
  the development of a subjective workplace identity, which can be recognized by 
  the organization and by other practitioners and which places novices on the 
  periphery of the community of practice (<a href="#Wenger">Wenger 1998</a>).</p>
  <p>By engaging with this 
  modality of information, novices learn to <i>act as practitioners</i>, but 
  they cannot <i>become practitioners </i>because they are removed from the 
  reflexive and reflective embodied experiences and tensions arising from 
  practice. They are also removed from connecting with the community of 
  workplace practitioners whose understanding of work performance is embedded in 
  actual experience. In preparatory training, corporeal information prepares the 
  body for routine work through the rehearsal of procedural practice, but cannot 
  prepare the novice body for the actual performance of real work because it is 
  removed from the uncertainties of actual practice.</p>
  <p>Similarly, while in training 
  there is limited engagement with social modalities of information which will 
  produce the level of intersubjectivity crucial for learning team performance 
  and engaging with the shared sense of meaning which is fundamental to the 
  development of a professionally recognized identity. In the preparatory 
  stages, social connections are made with trainers and educators whose primary 
  role is to afford opportunities for novices to engage with workplace training 
  environment. Trainers mediate and influence the novice's information 
  engagement towards the epistemic understandings of practice which will produce 
  successful assessable outcomes. However, once novices are assigned to 
  workplaces, these understandings are often contested, because they may not 
  reflect the embodied workplace understanding which is gained through actual 
  work.</p>
  <h2>Becoming a practitioner</h2>
  <p>Experienced practitioners 
  expressed the importance of social and corporeal information experiences as 
  critical in providing information that is central to the development their 
  performance and understandings of professional practice. Lloyd and Somerville 
  (<a href="#Lloyd_Somerville">2006</a>) have argued, that as an 
  intersubjective experience, workplace learning must include recognition of the 
  body as a central information source, which facilities reflection and 
  reflexivity. In addition, the sociocultural practices of the workplace are 
  also recognized by practitioners as critical information sources that connect 
  workers through shared experiences and render shared understandings about 
  place and practice. </p>
  <p>Practitioners, through their 
  experience, recognize that the textual site is important for developing a 
  preparatory framework for practice. However, once engaged with actual 
  practice, these sites are deemed less important and can become contestable 
  against the information experiences of embodied performance and the 
  development of real workplace relationships</p>
  <h2>Bringing 
  information literacy into view: Some key concepts</h2>
  <p>As a result of my ongoing 
  research into workplace IL, a number of key concepts have begun to emerge 
  which illustrate the complexity of IL as a sociocultural practice. By 
  understanding concepts such as context, information modalities and the role of 
  power in relation to subjective and intersubjective ways of knowing, and by 
  using these as a lens, researchers bring IL <i>into view. </i>Bringing IL<i> 
  into view </i>facilitates a greater understanding of how IL is played out in 
  situ, the types of information that are made available within context, and 
  what types of information are valued.</p>
  <p>In developing a framework for 
  exploring the nature of IL I will briefly describe these concepts as a way of 
  constructing a basic scaffold for understanding the various modalities in 
  which IL is manifest and is discursively understood. It should be noted that 
  this rendering is simplistic and only acts as a heuristic device.</p>
  <h2>Information literacy in situ: Context as a key concept</h2>
  <p>The manifestation of IL must 
  be understood within the context where it is experienced, that is, in relation 
  to the discourse and discursive values of the community which characterize and 
  help to construct the common understandings that are 'manifest in language, 
  social practices and structures' (<a href="#Fletcher">Fletcher 1999, p.143</a>). 
  In this respect IL is a dynamic process that facilitates knowing. Knowing, 
  according to Wenger (<a href="#Wenger">1998, p. 141</a>), is 'defined only in 
  the context of specific practices, where it arises out of a combination of a 
  regime of competence and an experience of meaning'.&nbsp; This is constituted 
  through experience with broader historical and social processes and practices 
  which occur within a social site and which facilitate structured and 
  unstructured learning about context. Knowing, therefore, is not an abstract 
  and reified construct, but a dynamically rendered position, situated within 
  the context of practice where an individual forms subjective and 
  intersubjective positions.</p>
  <p>Context can be defined as the 
  'setting or backdrop that envelops and determines phenomena'(<a href="#Schatzki">Schatzki 
  2002, p.xiv</a>) and that 'envelops entities and helps determine their 
  existence and being' (<a href="#Schatzki">Schatzki 2002, p. 20</a>). According 
  to Schatzki context is constituted by three aspects. It:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>embraces 
    and entangles the phenomenon;</li>
    <li>shapes 
    the phenomenon and entities within it;</li>
    <li>has 
    composition and character which will vary 'with the entities or phenomenon 
    that exist in context' (<a href="#Schatzki">Schatzki 2002, p.61-63</a>).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Context shapes and influences 
  what is learnt and how it is learnt, the forms of learning which are 
  legitimized, what information is valued, and what is contested. A context 
  shapes the sites of knowledge (knowing locations), and legitimizes the 
  modalities of information that are valued and through which identities and 
  positions are spoken into existence.</p>
  <h2>Knowing locations - information 
  modalities</h2>
  <p>In learning about the 
  information landscape, people must engage with a variety of knowing locations 
  that provide the landscape with its shape and character. For example, in 
  scientific contexts where knowing is viewed as axiomatic and objective, 
  knowing locations will focus on textual modalities. In embodied locations, 
  where knowing may be considered subjective/intersubjective, knowing locations 
  may be represented through the body as a corporeal source of information about 
  practice, or through the community of practice as a social modality for 
  intersubjective understandings about practice and identity. In both contexts, 
  knowing locations are discursively produced and influenced by social, 
  historical and political interests<b> </b>and IL is played out within them in 
  specific ways. &nbsp;In both studies three broad knowing locations - epistemic, 
  corporeal and social modalities - emerged and influenced the way in which IL 
  manifests. </p>
  <p><b>Epistemic</b> modalities 
  act as knowing locations for 'know-why' information. These locations are 
  textual (print and electronic) sites. These modalities are principally 
  theoretical, representational and context-independent and are underpinned by a 
  general analytic rationality (<a href="#Flyvjberg">Flyvjberg 2001</a>). Within 
  this modality information and knowledge are experienced as universal, 
  generalizable, and abstract. There is a common belief that truth is objective, 
  discoverable and reproducible. </p>
  <p>IL manifests in these 
  contexts as a set of skills, attributes and behaviours that are viewed as 
  measurable, and transferable from context to context. In this respect, 
  information is discursively produced and its use promoted by specific 
  communities, which represent particular ideological positions, values, beliefs 
  and attitudes. Textbooks, guidelines, standards and procedural documents are 
  examples of epistemic genres. Engaging with these modalities produces a 
  subjective position in relation to the codified, objective information which 
  is sanctioned by the organization. </p>
  <p><b>Corporeal </b>modalities 
  are formed through experience. They are, therefore, context-dependent 
  modalities that act as knowing locations for 'know-how' information (<a href="#Ryle">Ryle 
  1949</a>; <a href="#Billett">Billett 2001</a>). This type of information is 
  often tacit, or contingent,
  and is disseminated through demonstration and observation of practice 
  or accessed through the tactile and kinesthetic activity associated with 
  actual practice. This type of information cannot be easily articulated or 
  expressed explicitly, and, when it is, it is only partially explicit (<a href="#Blackler">Blackler 
  1995</a>). Lloyd (<a href="#Lloyd_2006">2006, p. 575</a>) has argued that 
  'bodies reflect the consciousness of engagement with information. They act as 
  a collector of sensory information, a site of knowledge and as a disseminator 
  of physical experience. The body in action provides its own narrative which 
  must be observed through practice'. In performance the body becomes the 
  intersection between epistemic information, information drawn from actual 
  performance, and information drawn from interaction with the community of 
  practice.</p>
  <p>In initial stages of 
  learning, the physical modality is an action space through which individual 
  interaction with information can be considered at the foundational stages of 
  learning about work to be ontogenetic, producing an individual subjectivity in 
  relation to the performance and practices of work. That is, novices&nbsp; <i>learn 
  how to act</i> <i>as a practitioner</i>, but at this preliminary stage cannot
  <i>become a practitioner, </i>because they lack the experiential grounding 
  which comes from actual practice. However, as interaction with the workplace 
  environment and with community of practice increases, corporeal information, 
  which is grounded in the experiences of the body in action, also grounds 
  intersubjectivity (<a href="#Sheets">Sheets-Johnstone 2000</a>) as the novice 
  interacts with other bodies and, through this interaction, 
  develops a mutuality of understanding which reflects the collective 
  understandings of how practice and the performance of work should proceed.</p>
  <p>Through interaction with 
  other actors within context, the novice body is drawn in and turned towards 
  the community of practice. Sheets-Johnstone (<a href="#Sheets">2000</a>) draws 
  on the concept of 'joint attention' to describe how learning is a 
  corporeal/kinetic relationship which grounds intersubjectivity (<a href="#Sheets">Sheets-Johnstone 
  2000, p.344</a>) and is at the heart of novice learning. Joint attention is 
  the result of the body being turned towards other situated bodies. This occurs 
  when novices are located initially on the periphery of a community of 
  practice. In their preparatory learning, novice bodies are turned towards the 
  community in a number of ways: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    Demonstration engages 
    novices with information about the range of actions required in professional 
    practice. Demonstration allows the novice to situate the body in relation to 
    the expectations and standards required of practice. It allows experts to 
    mediate information in relation to the action of performance and at the same 
    time turns novices' bodies towards joint attention that will produce a 
    shared focus that in early stages is preparatory, but allows the body to be 
    signified by other practitioners as a novice body.</li>
    <li>
    Rehearsal of 
    demonstrated practices affords the novice body with an opportunity to 
    develop a suite of bodily actions that may mirror those of experts, but is 
    still be unconnected to the realities and uncertainties of actual practice. 
    For intersubjectivity to develop bodies must be turned towards each other. 
    In the early stages of novice learning, epistemic, social and physical 
    modalities prepare the novice bodies for perfunctory performance, but they 
    cannot prepare them for the uncertainties of practice.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Social </b>modalities are 
  formed through practical knowledge and knowledge of praxis. In this respect 
  they are context-dependent and value-laden in relation to truth and competing 
  interests. This modality is&nbsp; also variable, pragmatic and actioned oriented (<a href="#Flyvjberg">Flyvjberg 
  2001, p.57</a>). The dissemination of action-oriented information in this 
  modality is tacit, and is influenced by praxis. Social modalities, therefore, 
  are intrinsically based in experience and act as a source of situated 
  knowledge. This type of information can be thought of as knowing the location 
  from which wisdom about practice is derived, rather than the location of 
  axiomatic truth.&nbsp; Social modalities are closely associated with reflection and 
  reflexivity about professional practice and professional identity. The sharing 
  of information within this modality occurs through activities such as 
  story-telling, deconstruction of events and interpretation of practice.. These activities 
  focus on developing an intersubjective connection between practitioners in 
  which shared meaning about practice can develop.</p>
  <h2>Playing out information literacy: The role of power as a 
  key concept</h2>
  <p>The manifestation of IL must 
  be viewed in situ and cannot be viewed as an unproblematic process, as has 
  often been the case (<a href="#Kapitzke">Kapitzke 2003</a>). The ability to 
  become information literate within context is influenced by the social, 
  historical and political interests which produce and shape context through its 
  discourses and discursive practices. Therefore, within each of the modalities 
  described above, coming to <i>know </i>the information environment may be 
  fraught with tensions produced by the contestation of information as it is 
  played out according to discourse and discursive practices. In this respect, 
  some voices will be heard, whilst others will remain silent.</p>
  <p>In accounting for power, Prus 
  (<a href="#Prus">1999, p.272</a>) suggests that power is not an 'objective 
  phenomenon' but a 'social, meaningful enacted essence'. In the preparatory 
  stages of learning about workplace performance, firefighters and ambulance 
  officers connect with epistemic sites of knowledge. Engaging with information, 
  in the form of written rules, practices and procedures, positions the novice 
  in relation to the organizational expectations, allowing novices to form an 
  institutionally recognized identity, i.e. they learn<i> to act as a 
  practitioner</i>.The transition from 
  preparatory training to the workplace requires engagement with an altered 
  discourse that reflects the social and corporeal realities that make up the 
  narrative of experienced workplace practice. Experienced workplace 
  practitioners play a powerful role in the transition of novices. Power is 
  enacted through discursive practices of the collective, who mediate the 
  information environment by guiding novices towards the sites of knowledge that 
  reflect the realities of workplace practice and performance. By engaging with 
  social and corporeal sites of knowledge, novices are drawn away from the 
  artificial&nbsp;constructs of practice constructed in preparatory training, 
  towards collective stories and workplace practices which reflect the realities 
  of actual work. Through this engagement they are repositioned into the intersubjectively shared constructs of the community of practice, and learn to<i> 
  become practitioners. </i></p>
  <h2>Implications for LIS researchers</h2>
  <p>IL is a complex sociocultural 
  practice that facilitates an individual's ability to engage with information 
  from a variety of modalities in situ, in order to know about the shape of 
  context, and the practices which influence and give meaning to this shape. In 
  the workplace contexts described here, engaging with the information 
  environment and the modalities of information available facilitates the 
  development of knowledge about practice and performance. In the act of the 
  preparatory engagement, workers move from learning <i>to act as a practitioner</i> 
  to<i> becoming a practitioner</i>. This transition is afforded through the 
  mediation of the community of practice and is centralized around the 
  introduction of context-dependent social and corporeal sources of information 
  that are experientially based. In the process of transition to actual work, 
  access to modalities of information changes. Workers move from engagement with 
  epistemic modalities to engagement with social and corporeal modalities. With 
  this change a gradual transition occurs from a subjective individual workplace 
  identity to an intersubjective workplace identity.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When exploring IL the role of 
  LIS researchers is to understand the way in which the information environment 
  is experienced and the outcomes of this experience. This requires researchers 
  to identify the character and shape of the context, to explore and identify 
  power relations, and to describe the impact that these relationships have on 
  the manifestation of IL practice and its outcomes within the context.
  As the ongoing research briefly described 
  here indicates, information environments are 'known' not only by cognitive 
  means, but also corporeally and socially, and that knowing involves the fluid 
  interconnection of modalities, in order to produce knowing, which is complex, 
  rich and meaningful.</p>
  <p>
  The findings of this ongoing research has 
  implications for LIS researchers. These are:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Adopting this IL approach opens up the research possibilities for LIS researchers, 
    but this will require LIS researchers to move outside their own field of 
    study and engage with other disciplines (eg. sociology, philosophy) and 
    fields of study (education, workplace studies) in order to identify the sociocultural outcomes of an engagement with information.</li>
    <li>
    Researchers, I would argue, should acknowledge IL as a phenomenon that is
    grounded in the realities of context and influenced by the practices 
    that are valued and afforded in context. To explore and analyse this 
    phenomenon and its associated behaviours and practices requires an 
    understanding of how each modality described in this paper is shaped by 
    sociocultural practices and expectations about what information is valued 
    and what sociocultural outcomes are expected by this engagement.</li>
    <li>Moving away 
    from Cartesian approaches to IL, allows researchers to consider a whole body 
    approach to understanding and describing IL. In doing so, researchers must 
    recognize that an engagement of and experience with information is not 
    solely mentalistic, but is also rendered through the body and the social 
    networks and communities with which an individual interacts. In this respect 
    it must be acknowledged that being information literate in one context does 
    not constitute being information literate in all contexts, as contexts 
    embrace and entangle the phenomenon, providing it with its shape and 
    character (<a href="#Schatzki">Schatzki 2002</a>).</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>When viewed holistically IL 
  is more than just a relationship with textual modalities and epistemic forms 
  of knowing. Becoming information literate is a sociocultural and an embodied 
  process that is constituted through the whole body being in the world, 
  experiencing information not only from textual modalities, but also from 
  social and corporeal modalities. In this respect the phenomenon is 
  context-dependent and, as such, should be explored through the grounded 
  information experiences of individuals and groups in situ. For LIS 
  researchers, this necessitates a move away from a textual skills and practice 
  based focus, towards incorporating an understanding of the sociocultural and 
  corporeal practices that are involved in coming <i>to know</i> an information 
  environment. LIS researchers who focus on IL have a substantial contribution 
  to make in all contexts. After all, information, regardless of whether it is 
  accessed in textual, oral or corporeal form is the basic foundation of 
  knowledge. As a catalyst to learning in all contexts, IL presents the LIS 
  researcher with many new challenges and opportunities to engage with other 
  disciplines and fields of study.</p>

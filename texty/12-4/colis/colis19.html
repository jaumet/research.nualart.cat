<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>The fact that information sharing is a dynamic process, shaped by individual
factors, situation, and context, is well known in library and information science
(LIS) today (<a href="#cas06">Case 2006</a>). Cultural and social issues are especially important and
the analysis shifts from cognitive to social, looking at the information seekers
within their social context (<a href="#mac03">Mackenzie 2003</a>). During the last years, many LIS
studies have emphasized these aspects, describing information practices in diverse
contexts (<a href="#sol99">Solomon 1999</a>, <a href="#dav02">Davenport and Hall 2002</a>,
<a href="#tal02">Talja 2002</a>, <a href="#hal03">Hall 2003</a>, <a href="#mck03">McKenzie 2003</a>,
<a href="#hyl06">Hyldegård 2006</a>, <a href="#wid05">Widén-Wulff 2005</a>. The
studies show that information behavior repertoires are shaped by organizational
culture, social identity, and sharing tradition among other things combined with
individual preferences.</p>

<p>Although we have a line of work looking at information practices in social
settings there are few studies of organizational information behavior looking
into the motivational mechanisms behind information sharing. In order to look
deeper into the social dimensions of information behavior, the theories of social
capital are suggested to bring valuable perspectives to this discussion
(<a href="#wid04">Widén-Wulff and Ginman 2004</a>). The aim of information sharing
in organizations is usually to bring individual knowledge to common attention and to work towards
common aims. It is said that social capital helps to facilitate the development
of collective intellectual capital (<a href="#hof05">Hoffman, Hoelscher et al. 2005</a>)
and it enables a more efficient collective action because it encourages cooperative behaviour
(<a href="#col88">Coleman 1988</a>, <a href="#nah98">Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998</a>).
From this perspective, it is clear that understanding how social capital works is
vital for a deeper understanding of sharing mechanisms as well.</p>

<p>Studies into information behavior in organizations are mainly conducted in
various business settings but it would be important to develop the understanding
of information sharing in other kinds of environments too (<a href="#cas96">Castells 1996-98</a>,
<a href="#opp03">Oppenheim, Stenson et al. 2003</a>). The aim of this study is to explore the information
sharing context through the social capital perspective in a university setting.
Information sharing in academia is fairly little studied but there are some important
works.  Talja (<a href="#tal02">2002</a>) put forward the concept of collaborative information behavior
among researchers and found also disciplinary differences in information sharing.
Huotari (<a href="#huo99">1999</a>, <a href="#huo00">2000</a>) has studied social
networks and value constellation within a university. For instance, in comparison
with other units at the university, the faculties' internal informal contacts seemed
to be active and the use of social contacts to gain formal information was frequent
(<a href="#huo99">Huotari 1999</a>, <a href="#huo00">2000</a>).
Cronin (<a href="#cro01">2001</a>) reminds us that the university context is quite different from the
others concerning information behavior. Management of information and knowledge
does not easily work in the university setting where the members may find their
loyalty closer to their discipline than to their parent institution.</p>

<p>With the university context as a challenging setting for effective information
sharing this study aims to explore the social capital framework in order to gain
insights into the information sharing mechanisms. This is a new way of looking at
the collaborative information behaviour in the university context and the purpose
is to discover whether the theory of social capital is useful for exploring mechanisms
behind knowledge sharing.</p>

<p>The empirical work is conducted within a Finnish university faculty and the main questions to be answered are</p>
<ul><li>What kind of social capital exists in the university faculty?</li>

<li>How are the incentives crystallized from the faculty's social capital affecting information sharing?</li>
</ul>


<p>In the following chapter we describe the social capital theory and the three
main dimensions of social capital that are studied. In chapter 4 the methods and
the empirical material are presented and in chapter 5 the account of social capital
in the studied faculty is analysed. In chapter 6 we discuss which incentives affect
communication and information sharing. Concluding remarks are given in chapter 7.</p>

<h2>Dimensions of social capital</h2>

<p>Social capital can generally be described as the capital created in social
relations and in the network structure. Social capital can be mobilized to
facilitate individual and organizational activities (e.g. <a href="#adl02">Adler and Kwon 2002</a>).
As well as economic capital, social capital has to be managed to be prosperous.
However, social capital differs from other forms of capital since it changes
with the social relations. If the relations die out, social capital is no longer
nurtured and consequently fades away (<a href="#adl02">Adler and Kwon 2002</a>).</p>

<p>Research on social capital has been carried out in different disciplines and
at different levels depending on the chosen perspective (the social unit or the
individual): macro level in sociology and political studies (e.g. citizenship
in geographic regions) (<a href="#put00">Putnam 2000</a>); meso-level in sociology and business studies
(e.g. interunit resource exchange in organizations) (<a href="#tsa98">Tsai and Ghoshal 1998</a>);
and micro level in sociology (e.g. individual gains in forms of status and career
opportunities) (<a href="#bur00">Burt 2000</a>, <a href="#lin99">Lin 1999</a>).
There exists no unified definition of social capital. Instead, the different views
can be defined by the focus of the research approaches. Social capital is often
subdivided into bridging and bonding social capital. Bridging social capital is
connected with one actor's external relations with other actors (e.g. <a href="#bur00">Burt 2000</a>).
Bonding social capital, on the other hand, is related to the internal structure of
relations between actors in a social unit (e.g. <a href="#col88">Coleman 1988</a>,<a href="#put00">Putnam 2000)</a>).
In some research scopes neither bridging nor bonding social capital is excluded
(e.g. <a href="#nah98">Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998</a>). One definition of social capital
that includes both the individual and the social unit is Nahapiet's and Ghoshal's (<a href="#nah98">1998</a>), 243)
well cited definition: </p>

<blockquote><i>"The sum of actual and potential resources embedded within, available
through, and derived from the network of relationships possessed by an individual
or social unit. Social capital thus comprises both the network and the assets that
may be mobilized through that network"</i>.</blockquote>

<p>The following dimensions of social capital have been chosen in this paper:
structural dimension (network character); relational dimension (trust and social
identity); and finally content or communication dimension.</p>

<p>
<i>The structural dimension</i> includes the network structure and the nature of
the network ties between the actors. Networks are viewed as the cornerstone for
resource exchange and the ties can be described as information channels
(e.g. <a href="#adl02">Adler and Kwon 2002</a>). Networks characterized by closure in the network
structure have been seen as facilitating the emergence of trust and common norms
(e.g. <a href="#col88">Coleman 1988</a>). On the other hand, according to those network analysts that
emphasize the importance of an open and divided network structure, the individual
actor gains advantages by the effective mastering of information flow over the
so called structural holes, i.e. holes in the network that separate actors from
each other (e.g. <a href="#bur00">Burt 2000</a>). From an organizational point of view, it has been
suggested that close structures rather than divided structures with few redundant
ties are favourable since closure facilitates collective actions whereas structural
holes create a splintered organization which obstructs collective goals
(<a href="#lea99">Leana and Van Buren 1999</a>).</p>

<p><i>The relational dimension</i> embraces social identity and trust.  The notion
of trust is a crucial dimension of social capital, irrespective of trust is viewed
as social capital (<a href="#fuk95">Fukuyama 1995</a>); a form of social capital
(<a href="#col88">Coleman 1988</a>); or a key driving force to social capital
(<a href="#put00">Putnam 2000</a>). According to Fukuyama (<a href="#fuk95">1995</a>, 26),
trust can be defined as: </p>

<blockquote><i>"The expectations that arises within a community of regular, honest,
and cooperative behaviour, based on commonly shared norms, on the part of other
members of that community". </i>.</blockquote>

<p>An atmosphere characterized by trust among the members of an organization has
been suggested facilitating information and knowledge sharing, cooperation and
other forms of collective actions within and outside the social unit
(<a href="#huo03">Huotari and Iivonen 2003</a>). Furthermore, it has been stated that trust is a key
driving force in the creation of intellectual capital in business settings
(<a href="#tsa98">Tsai and Ghoshal 1998</a>) and for the management of changes in academia, for example,
reduced external budget funds (<a href="#all05">Allen 2005</a>). From an organizational point of view,
it has been stressed that organizations with strong social capital are also
characterized by strong affective trust (<a href="#lea99">Leana and Van Buren 1999</a>). The affective
form of trust is created and nurtured by repeated interactions between actors and
is based on the actor's view of the other person's norms and values, whereas
cognitive trust includes judgements on other persons' competence and reliability
in work settings (<a href="#rou98">Rousseau et al. 1998</a>), <a href="#son03">Sonnenwald 2003</a>).
It has also been emphasised that both cognitive and affective trust is needed for efficient cooperation between
the individuals in an organization (Sonnenwald 2003). Furthermore, a study by
Sonnenwald (<a href="#son03">2003</a>) indicates that relations based on cognitive distrust and affective
distrust do not generate cooperation, whereas relations based on affective trust
and cognitive distrust generate limited cooperation. The earlier mentioned study
at a university underlined the aspect of boundaries and the insider/outsider
perspective as an incentive for information sharing in universities (<a href="#huo01">Huotari and
Chatman 2001</a>). It was found that information was not shared with outsiders within
the university if they are not trusted. The need for further studies on the role
of trust in knowledge sharing was also emphasized (<a href="#huo01">Huotari and
Chatman 2001</a>).</p>

<p>Identification is also viewed as an important part of relational social capital
(<a href="#nah98">Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998</a>). Cognitive identification can be described as the process
by which individuals view themselves as part of a social unit and define themselves
by the group (<a href="#nah98">Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998</a>, (<a href="#tyl01">Tyler and Blader 2001</a>).
According to Tyler and Blader (<a href="#tyl01">2001</a>), the status-related identification
is described as the desire among individuals to achieve a positive picture of themselves
through membership in highly stated organizations. They have shown that both cognitive
and status-related identification are stronger motivational driving forces to collective
actions than other motives such as salary. Common organizational identity is in fact
a key factor in efficient interunit knowledge sharing (<a href="#bar03">Barner-Rasmussen 2003</a>).</p>

<p>In this study the <i>content or communication dimension</i> is seen as a key dimension
in social capital (<a href="#haz00">Hazleton &amp; Kennan 2000</a>). Communication is seen
as both a foundation for social capital and as a key mechanism in generating further
organizational goals, e.g. intellectual capital and reduced transactions costs
((<a href="#haz00">Hazleton and Kennan 2000</a>). By communication a common knowledge
base can be created, which facilitates further communication and information sharing.
The communication content within the network structure can also be seen as a key
motivation to information practices (<a href="#adl02">Adler and Kwon 2002</a>),
(<a href="#nah98">Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998</a>). Versatile communicative ability is
crucial in creating the communicative mechanism that creates further advantages in
organizations with fruitful social capital (<a href="#haz00">Hazleton and Kennan 2000</a>).</p>

<h2>Methods and material </h2>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>Empirical studies on social capital mainly attempt to quantify social capital
and its contribution to economic development, and show the link between the different
social capital dimensions (<a href="#tsa98">Tsai and Ghoshal 1998</a>). Studies on social capital most
often explore the phenomenon on a community or society level (<a href="#put00">Putnam 2000</a>),
<a href="#kno06">Knorringa &amp; Staveren 2006</a>). There are several measures for social capital and obtaining
a single, true measure is probably not possible. Woolcock and Narayan (<a href="#woo00">2000</a>) point
out that this is because definitions of social capital are multidimensional,
including different levels of analysis. Further, the forms of social capital change
over time shifting between formal and informal organizations. Anyhow, common measures
in the studies are the membership in informal and formal associations and networks
and the trust, norms, values that facilitate exchanges and lower transaction costs
(<a href="#woo00">Woolcock and Narayan 2000</a>, <a href="#sch01">Schuller 2001</a>,
<a href="#kri02">Krishna and Schrader 2002</a>).</p>

<p>Studies of social capital differ in the way in which they have addressed the
issues of network and trust. Some assess social capital in terms of network density;
others rely on a measure of trust. Actual measures vary and identifying the locally
meaningful measures of social capital for a given context is a more empirical task
(<a href="#lin03">Lin 2003</a>, 63). Krishna &amp; Shrader (<a href="#kri02">2002</a>)
argue that the best approach is to combine several assessments. A tool for measuring
social capital must provide a common conceptual framework that helps unify the different
dimensions of social capital (structure, content, and relation).</p>

<p>Social capital and information sharing were measured in the university faculty
by the following three main parts in the semi-structured interviews: 1) social
identification with the faculty which included questions about the cognitive identification
(e.g. view on faculty as 'we' or 'they', view on the problems in the faculty as their own problems)
and the status-related identification (e.g. pride with faculty belonging and respect
from the faculty colleagues); 2) affective trust (e.g. the colleagues reliability,
selfishness and caring for other colleagues); 3) and the interviewees' personal
communication and cooperation as well as their view on the overall communication
and cooperation in the faculty (content, frequency, networks, and motivational aspects)
(<a href="#tyl00">Tyler and Blader 2000</a>, <a href="#tyl00">2001</a>, <a href="#wri91">Wrightsman 1991</a>).
In this study, the main focus lies on the interdepartmental information sharing, i.e. the interviewees' communication
with their faculty colleagues from other departments.</p>

<h3>Material</h3>

<p> Finnish university faculty is studied in this paper.  The relationship between
knowledge management and social capital for successful organizational knowledge
creation has been stressed in several business and organization contexts
(<a href="#coh01">Cohen and Prusak 2001</a>, <a href="#nah98">Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1998</a>,
<a href="#tsa98">Tsai and Ghoshal 1998</a>, <a href="#wid04">Widén-Wulff and Ginman 2004</a>,
 <a href="#wid07">Widén-Wulff 2007</a>). Furthermore, the university system - both internationally
 and in Finland - is undergoing some rather great changes (e.g. educational and financial),
 and the effects from social capital, e.g. synergy, reduced transaction costs and intellectual capital,
could be seen as crucial to handling these changes efficiently. Therefore, it is
especially interesting to study the mechanisms behind knowledge sharing in this
complex and splintered culture of academia further.</p>

<p>The material in this qualitative study consists of 13 semi-structured interviews
with professors and heads of departments from different departments from one faculty
(referred to here as persons 1-13).  The relatively small faculty has 14 separate
units or departments from various disciplines in the broad fields of social sciences,
legal science and economics. The faculty staff is situated in 8 different buildings
at the university campus area.  The number of professors in each department ranges
from one to three. The interviews (1.5-2 hr each) were transcribed and analyzed.
The material was analyzed through several categorizations and scorings according
to the themes in the theoretical framework.</p>

<h2>Social capital in the university faculty</h2>
<p>In an empirical study in a university faculty, the following dimensions of social
capital were measured and examined: network structure, identification, trust and
communication (<a href="#t0t06">Tötterman 2006</a>).</p>

<p><i>The structural dimension</i> was analyzed by the network linkages (internal/external)
and by the network structure (formal/informal). The faculty's structural dimension
overall seems to be characterized by dispersion in the faculty network structure
and by local and bounded networks comprised of a couple of professors and heads
of department. The faculty and university external linkages tend to be strongly
emphasized by the interviewees. For many interviewees these external linkages
even seem to exclude the importance and existence of faculty and university
internal linkages.</p>

<blockquote>"I tend to communicate more outside the university than I communicate
within [the faculty and university]" (person 3).</blockquote>

<p>Within the local and bounded networks the linkages are more frequent. These
local faculty internal networks seem overall to include only the faculty colleagues
from departments which are very close in a scholarly manner. These quotes describe
the connections in the few local networks within the faculty:</p>

<blockquote>"I communicate with [the colleagues at department x in the local network]
on a daily basis" (person 9).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When it comes to [the department x in the local network], we cooperate
basically on everything. It can be about research, education, administration, external
funding..." (person 2).</blockquote>

<p>The network structures within the faculty are characterized by both formality
and informality. The formal structures mainly include the ties between the professors
in the faculty board and between the professors and the faculty administration.
The informal ties are quite sparse and they consist of faculty colleagues within
the local networks or quite occasionally between professors outside these local
networks.</p>

<blockquote>"In the [local network] we communicate actively. We have for example so called
'professors meetings', where we come together and discuss things in an informal manner" (person 3).</blockquote>

<p><i>The relational dimension</i> of social capital was measured by the interviewees'
identification with the faculty (cognitive and status-related) and their affective
trust towards faculty colleagues. The questions were mainly structured, but the
interviewees were encouraged to further elaborate on the topics. In this context,
four different profiles were identified among the interviewees: active faculty
identification or "the faculty-identifiers" (persons 9,12,13); slightly active
faculty identification or "the identity uncertain professors" (persons 1,2,7,8);
slightly passive faculty identification or "the identity indifferent professors"
(persons 3,6,11); and passive faculty identification or "the lone wolves"
(persons 4,5,10).</p>

<p>The active faculty identification profile or "the faculty-identifiers" can be
characterized by the strongest cognitive identification or "we-feeling" with the
faculty. For example, they seem to view both the problems and the praise of the
faculty as their own private matters. However, the identification with the faculty
is seldom very clear. The role of the university and one's own department often
come to the fore.</p>

<blockquote>"I view identification [with the faculty] as very strong. On the other
hand, it is general practice in scholarly articles to write only the name of the
university and the department, not the faculty. The name of the department represents
your own discipline" (person 9).</blockquote>

<p>As to the status-related identification, the faculty-identifiers tend to feel
strong pride in the faculty membership, although one's own department is more
crucial in this sense. Furthermore, these interviewees also appear to feel a
strong respect from the other faculty colleagues in regard to their work competence
and ideas. No one feels that the colleagues would want to replace them in the
faculty community. The affective trust seems to be the highest among these interviewees,
since no one believes the colleagues to be more unreliable than reliable.</p>

<p>The second profile, the slightly active faculty identification profile or
"the identity uncertain professors", includes the interviewees with a stronger
uncertainty towards the cognitive identification or 'we-feeling' with the faculty.
This profile seem to include those faculty members who feel either that the problems
in the faculty belong to everyone or that one's own department is emphasized instead
of the faculty's problems. As to the status-related identification with the faculty,
the identity uncertain professors reveal a more uncertain and varying picture than
the first profile. For example, there tends to exist a genuine pride in the faculty
membership, positive accounts of the faculty organization and feelings of respect
from the other colleagues in regard to the collective faculty work efforts.
However, at the same time, the identity uncertain professors seem to be more
engaged with their own department or the university as a whole than with the faculty.
Furthermore, the interviewees appear to feel somewhat uncertain towards the colleagues'
respect in regard to the interviewees' ideas and work efforts at their own department.
The affective trust in this profile seems to be quite similar to the first profile
in regard to the interviewees' view of the colleagues as more reliable than unreliable.
However, they view the egoistic and exploitative nature of the faculty as quite
a normal consequence of the university structure of today.</p>

<p>
The third category, the slightly passive faculty identification profile or "the
identity indifferent professors", comprises the faculty members with quite low
cognitive faculty identification. The interviewees view the faculty identification
as strongly decreasing. One's own department is strongly emphasized in this context,
and the identification with the faculty is treated as quite uninteresting.
The status-related identification is also characterized by indifference and uncertainty.
Overall, the interviewees do seem to feel respect of their colleagues. As to the
matter of trust, the interviewees tend to emphasize the trustworthiness of
colleagues at their own department. The appearance of unreliability among the
faculty colleagues is viewed as a consequence of the national changes in the
university structure. For example, changes in budget funding results in competition
among the departments. One interviewee compared the current situation of decreasing
reliability among the faculty staff with the situation before:</p>

<blockquote>"Everything is a consequence of the situation today [with the current
university organization and financial policies]. Every one deceives to get positions
and money. It used to be different" (person 11).</blockquote>

<p>The last profile, the passive faculty identification profile or "the lone wolves",
is characterized by the lowest level of cognitive identification in comparison
with the other profiles. The 'we-feeling' in the faculty seems to be non-existent
and instead the faculty, the faculty organization and faculty colleagues are
criticized. One's own department's greatness is to some extent over emphasized
in contrast to the negative picture of the rest of the faculty. The status-related
identification is also low among the lone wolves. No one feels pride in the faculty
membership and the interview answers sometimes include strong dissociation from
the faculty.</p>

<blockquote>"I like it very much at my own department, but to the faculty as a whole
I don't feel any kind of belonging!" (person 10).</blockquote>

<p>No one feels strong respect of their colleagues, and some of the lone wolves
even feel that colleagues would be prepared to replace them in their post. As to
the trust in the faculty, the interviewees tend to have a rather negative picture
of their colleagues' trustworthiness and the culture particularly in this faculty
seems to be viewed as extremely unreliable and selfish.</p>

<p><i>The communication dimension</i> of social capital was measured by questions
about the interviewees' communication networks inside the faculty: the communication
frequency; the information and knowledge content; further collaborative activities
within the faculty; and the motivations behind communication activities. Furthermore,
the interviews also included general questions about the interviewees' view on the
overall communication climate in the faculty.</p>

<p>To shed light on the analyzed results, the interviewees were divided into four
categories depending on their communication profile: the most active communication
profile or "the open-minded network players" (persons 2,7,9,12); the slightly active
communication profile or "the professional network players"  (persons 1,8,13);
the slightly passive communication profile or "the external-minded network players"
(persons 3,6,11); and the passive communication profile or "the faculty outsiders"
(4,5,10).</p>

<p>The overall picture of the faculty's communication climate indicates that the
most frequent, highly-valued and content-rich communication occurs in the most active
communication profile. The interest in interaction with faculty colleagues seems
to be highest in this profile. The open-minded network players tend to be part of
a couple of local communication networks, consisting mainly of faculty colleagues
from geographically and disciplinary closely-related departments. The communication
content in these networks tends to be both social (e.g. issues outside the office,
private matters) and professional (e.g. administration, cooperation projects, need
of disciplinary expertise), with quite a rich information and knowledge sharing
pattern.  One of the open-minded network players gave a description of the communication
climate in his close local network:</p>

<blockquote>"Apart from strictly professional interactions, also non-professional
communication occurs in the close local communication networks. We discuss various
problems in the everyday life or discuss current phenomena in the society which
has nothing to do with our teaching or research" (person 9).</blockquote>

<p>The second profile, the slightly active communication profile or "the professional
network players", includes those faculty members with a slightly defused communication
frequency or interest towards communication and collaboration activities.  These
faculty members tend to be involved in sporadic informal communication activities
with faculty colleagues both at working hours and to some extent outside the office.
However, some of these faculty members seem not to be part of any similar close
local communication networks, such as the interviewees in the first group. The communication
content appears to be of mainly professional character (e.g. administration,
cooperation projects).</p>

<p>The third category, the slightly passive communication profile or "the external-minded
network players", includes the faculty members with a quite low interest in
communication with faculty colleagues and a quite weak communication frequency
within the faculty. One of the external-minded network players described the overall
picture of the communication climate in the faculty as quite fragmented. This seems
to be quite a general view among the interviewees:</p>

<blockquote>"I think that the communication between the departments generally is
quite weak [...]. We can be described as 'islands' in this faculty [...] that pursue
our own interests and politics" (person 3).</blockquote>

<p>In this profile, information sharing activities with colleagues seem to be almost
completely absent, either due to lack of interest or due to external reasons. For
example, changes in the university administration cause a large workload for professors
and heads of departments, which in turn diminishes the interest and need for collaborative
activities with faculty colleagues. However, the external-minded network players
appear to some extent to be part of local communication networks consisting of faculty
colleagues from geographically and disciplinary closely related departments, but
these networks do not seem to be of great importance to the interviewees. Instead,
the faculty external communication networks seem to be highly valued. The communication
content among these interviewees appears to be of a mainly professional character
(e.g. administration, cooperation projects).</p>

<p>The last profile, the passive communication profile or "the faculty outsiders",
is characterized by an almost complete lack of communication (both informal and formal)
within the faculty. Furthermore, the interest towards any further information sharing
activities seems to be missing. Overall, the faculty outsiders tend to be somewhat
or very negative to the whole faculty as an organization, to the faculty internal
communication and cooperation as well as to the faculty colleagues. In contrast
to the faculty internal communication, the faculty outsiders tend to emphasize
information sharing within their own department and the faculty external communication
networks.</p>

<h2>New insights into positive and negative incentives affecting sharing in
groups and organizations (through SC dimensions)</h2>

<p>When a comparison is made between the two profile categories (identification
and communication profiles), findings show quite a strong connection between the
two categories of profiles. Those interviewees that belong to the active communication
profiles (the open-minded network players and the professional network players)
also belong to the active identification profiles (the faculty-identifiers and
the identity uncertain professors). Furthermore, the interviewees in the passive
communication profiles (the external-minded network players and the faculty outsiders)
also belong to the passive identification profiles (the identity indifferent
professors and the lone wolves). This indicates a tendency of a lack of organizational
social capital within the faculty's interdepartmental relations. This in turn has
effects on the faculty's information sharing climate. As Del Favero (<a href="#del03">2003</a>) has
pointed out, effective information sharing between different entities (faculty-administrators)
at a faculty is important for fruitful faculty management and for organizational
favours (e.g. resource exchange). However, which are the incentives affecting
sharing in this faculty?</p>

<p>The findings from this study indicate that information sharing tends to work
more efficiently within the departments, the local bounded networks and the faculty
external networks. The prerequisites for social capital seem to exist in these environments.
The interviewees themselves stress some important incentives for a successful
information sharing climate, such as working in the same building, personal friendship
and scholarly closeness. As Cronin (<a href="#cro01">2001</a>) points out, the identification with the
discipline both within the university and outside it seems to be of great importance
for the faculty professors at this faculty. Furthermore, most interviewees tend
to underline the existence of formal and informal network structures, trust and
an open communication climate within one's own department and in some cases with
one's closest neighboring departments. In these environments, the signs of active
collaborative information sharing are most obvious.</p>

<p>Overall, the information sharing climate in the faculty seems, however, to be
splintered. Many interviewees oppose the current situation of fragmented communication
and collaboration climate, distrust, reckless competition of positions and funding
and no strong sense of faculty belonging. Some interviewees stated that the faculty
used to have a more open communication climate with closer interdepartmental relations.
The faculty departments are also situated in several different buildings across the
campus, which many interviewees dislike. The interviewees underline that many of the
difficulties in the collaboration climate are a result of the unsuccessful fusion
of two larger faculties over 25 years ago. At this point, the faculty tends to be
a very splintered one with quite large differences in scholarly and organizational
values and visions.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the latest changes and reforms in the Finnish university system
(e.g. top-down regulations concerning university budget funding from government)
appear to undermine the prerequisites for the emergence of social capital and an
open internal communication climate with knowledge sharing and collaborative
activities. The many changes within the university system's education and
administration combined with limited funding create stressful relations with lack
of time and even tough competition and arguments between the departments as a result.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>This study does suggest that social capital is a useful framework to gain
insights into information sharing mechanisms. The framework of social capital
thus sheds light and characterizes the incentives for information sharing in a
very distinct manner. The findings show that the studied university faculty is a
very fragmented one. There exist many different forms of cultures with their own
kinds of social capital, which in turn affects their information sharing activities.
This tool has highlighted important problems in information sharing on the faculty
organizational level. These problems could be approached by clearer and more integrated
faculty goals and visions, which would cultivate social capital and its fruitful
effects on the organizational level. Finally, this study also stresses the need
for further research on social capital and information sharing in different
organizational environments as well as within the complex university setting.</p>

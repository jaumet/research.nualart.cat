<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Theorising  computer-mediated information seeking means establishing a framework for  exploring such information practices in context. Such study brings with it the  challenge of dealing with digital environments. Lyman and Wakeford (<a href="#LYP99">1999</a>: 360) observe that exploring methodological issues associated with the study of  digital and networked technologies involves dealing with the &ldquo;paradoxes of  fieldwork around digital technologies- online and offline.&rdquo; Recognising  information practices as ever-shifting and multi-sited brings with it a need to  regularly rethink and refigure observations made &ldquo;in the field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My own aim  was to develop a fine-grained exploration of human judgments of relevance that  involved studying scholarly researchers using networked information resources.<a href="#note1">1</a>  In such study, accepting that context is a critical part of understanding human  judgments of relevance is only the first step. The bigger question is how to  identify and frame the context of the inquiry - Where are judgments of relevance  to be examined? Where do they take place? When do they take place? If such  judgments are located within the wider context of the information practices of  scholarly research, can they be examined as discrete units of activity? </p>
<p>Contemporary  social theory encourages us to move away from exploring context in isolation  from the individual or the individual in isolation from her context (Blackler <a href="#BLF95">1995</a>).  The relationship is neither dichotomous nor linear:</p>
<blockquote>
 Constructions held  by people are born out of their experience with and interaction with their  context. Indeed, the tie is so close &hellip; that constructions create the context that the constructors experience and are in turn given  life by that created context (Guba and Lincoln <a href="#GEG89">1989</a>: 60).
</blockquote>
<p>This  perspective is reflected in contemporary research in information studies, where  the dualities and dichotomies inherent in many traditional theoretical  perspectives have been unable to fully explain human information behaviour.</p>
<p>Increasingly  research involves appreciating individuals as socially and culturally located  beings. The inherently interactive character of human relevance judgments, for  example, means that social and private aspects are interwoven in the seeking  and gathering of information. Conceptualising information seeking as a natural component of everyday  practice relates to Bourdieu&rsquo;s <em>habitus </em>(e.g. <a href="#BOP90">1990</a>: 52-65), as Savolainen (<a href="#SAR95">1995</a>), for instance, illustrates. Similarly,  Leydesdorff (<a href="#LEL00">2000</a>) relates Habermas&rsquo; portrayal of events in the &ldquo;lifeworld&rdquo; to  the study of communicating and searching for information in social contexts.  Framing information practices in this manner is seen as essential for  understanding the way those contexts shape action and interpretation.</p>
<p>To explore  practices mediated by computers, researchers have acknowledged the need to move  beyond the dichotomizing inherent in traditional searcher/system divides.  Theoretical frameworks for exploring both aspects of socio-material relations  are becoming increasingly important. Thus, we continue to find technologist/anthropologist  partnerships within human computer interaction (Human-Computer Interaction) and computer-supported, co-operative work (Computer  Supported Cooperative Work) research communities (see for example discussions  in Dourish &amp; Anderson <a href="#DOP06">2006</a>; R&auml;s&auml;nen &amp; Nyce <a href="#RAM06">2006</a>; Suchman, Blomberg,  Orr, &amp; Trigg <a href="#SLA99">1999</a>). In one of the earliest such works, Suchman (1987)  demonstrates the significance of the interactional and social as well as the  technical elements for interface design. More recently, Dourish and Anderson (<a href="#DOP06">2006</a>: 321)  write: </p>
<blockquote>
As a computer  scientist with a deep concern for the social systems within which information  technology is embedded and a cultural anthropologist with a fundamental  orientation toward technology design, we bring to this investigation the belief  that social and technical are irremediably recursively linked &hellip;.
</blockquote>
<p>For them,  this position is the starting point of any design problem. It is the contention  of this paper that for library and information science (library and information science) research about  computer-mediated information practices (which one can argue are becoming  increasingly the norm) such a position should be <strong>our</strong> starting point.</p>
<p>When  theorizing computer-mediated information practices, one of the first issues one  has to tackle is the notion of interaction. Following the lessons learned in  the human computer interaction community, embodiment and an appreciation of cognition outside the self  is a natural progression from such study of the human-machine interface (see  for example: Dourish <a href="#DOP01">2001</a>, <a href="#DOP04">2004</a>; Hollan, Hutchins, &amp; Kirsh <a href="#HOJ00">2000</a>; Robertson, <a href="#ROT97">1997</a>; Rogers <a href="#ROY04">2004</a>). Also connected to this discussion is the notion of  practice. Thus, the next part of this paper looks at each of these in more  detail. These three notions cannot be neatly pulled apart, and doing so in no  way diminishes the complexity of the entanglements one discovers on close  inspection of these elements. However, discussing each in turn will help  illustrate the value of this way of thinking for library and information science research. The second part  of the paper then tackles the challenge of translating these theoretical  foundations into analytical devices for library and information science research. </p>

<h2>Interaction</h2>
<p>Tools and technologies are used to interact with people and informative artefacts. 
  Because using technology is not a given, in human computer interaction research studying interaction 
  has come to mean studying the social, cultural and historical contexts in which 
  the interaction takes place (Dourish <a href="#DOP04">2004</a>; R&auml;s&auml;nen 
  &amp; Nyce <a href="#RAM06">2006</a>). Furthermore, Suchman makes the point 
  that human-machine &ldquo;interaction&rdquo; blurs the lines between the physical 
  and the social, between a tool that one uses and a person with whom one communicates: 
  &quot;Interaction between people and machines implies mutual intelligibility, 
  or shared understandings&quot; (Suchman <a href="#SLA87">1987</a>: 6).<br />
  </p>
<p>Information  systems further challenge the idea of an interface as something separating human  from machine, in that they act as tools with a primary function of linking  people to the embodiment of ideas expressed by others. Thus, Suchman&rsquo;s  discussion of interaction can be applied readily to the human-machine exchanges  that are the subject of research about computer-mediated information practices.  Locating information practices (such as searching, selecting, and evaluating)  within such a framework, both human and material properties need to be  appreciated and studied. Human-computer interaction has increasingly been  recognized as having a socio-material character encompassing many human-human  and human-machine variations taking place at any one time (see for example: Anderson, <a href="#ATDip">in press</a>). Some of this interaction is simultaneous; some is progressive. No  matter how interaction is conceptualized, we gain an appreciation of the  complexity of information practices in such a mediated context.</p>
<p>Suchman&rsquo;s  (<a href="#SLA87">1987</a>) much cited text introduced and illustrated a more complex framing of  interaction to human computer interaction and computer-supported, co-operative work researchers and the ethnomethodological notion of  &ldquo;situated action.&rdquo; She locates plans in the larger context of ongoing  &ldquo;practice&rdquo;. A &ldquo;situated action&rdquo; unfolds in the doing, in interaction with the  circumstances that make a situation. In other words, the plan does not predict  the specific action. Suchman&rsquo;s work draws attention to the improvised character  of people&rsquo;s moment-by-moment interaction with technology. In his own  theoretical arguments about interaction and context, Dourish (<a href="#DOP04">2004</a>) draws on  the link between Suchman&rsquo;s &rdquo;situated action&rdquo; and Lave&rsquo;s &ldquo;situated practice&rdquo; &ndash; a  relationship that will be drawn upon later in this paper.</p>
<p>Similarly,  the interactive approach of researchers like Burnett &amp; McKinley (<a href="#BUK98">1998</a>)  (drawing on the work of Deleuze &amp; Guattari) is a rhizomorphic model they  offer as a replacement for earlier notions of structured and predictable  searcher-system interaction. Theirs is an image of interconnectivity,  complexity, multiplicity and fragmentation. </p>
<p>Through  such discussions of different levels and types of interaction, it was realized  that context cannot be equated with interaction (M. L. Anderson <a href="#AML03">2003</a>; Dourish  <a href="#DOP01">2001</a>, <a href="#DOP04">2004</a>; Hollan et al. <a href="#HOJ00">2000</a>; R&auml;s&auml;nen &amp; Nyce <a href="#RAM06">2006</a>). As the examination of  searcher-system interaction deepened, the frame of reference for the context in  which such interaction could be said to take place expanded to encompass every  wider webs of relationships and processes. To understand how action emerges in  a computer-mediated context, researchers moved beyond the spatial and temporal  contexts of a system-in-use to try to take account of social, cultural,  organisational, and interactionional contexts. Understanding context meant  dealing with lived experiences &ndash; dealing with actions. The interactions between  people and the systems in use had to be recognized as embodied (Dourish <a href="#DOP01">2001</a>).</p>

<h2>Embodiment</h2>

<p>Recognizing  computer-mediated contexts as culturally and socially located leads to an  appreciation of embodied interactions and a re-interpretation of human beings  &ldquo;&hellip;in terms which put agency rather than contemplation at its center&hellip;&rdquo; (M. L.  Anderson <a href="#AML03">2003</a>: 104). Increasingly human computer interaction researchers apply situated and embodied  approaches to the study of human-technology relations, recognising humans as  &ldquo;embodied beings&rdquo; (Quek <a href="#QUF06">2006</a>; Robertson <a href="#ROT97">1997</a>). The focus on the embodiment of a  thinking subject draws on phenomenology and the particular influences of  Merleau-Ponty and Heidegger (for further discussion see: M. L. Anderson <a href="#AML03">2003</a>;  Dourish <a href="#DOP01">2001</a>; Robertson <a href="#ROT97">1997</a>). </p>
<p>From an  embodied perspective, cognition exists outside the individual. Quek (<a href="#QUF06">2006</a>:  388), for example, when describing the embodied mind explains: </p>
<blockquote>
&hellip;our sensory,  perceptual, and cognitive abilities are inextricably tied to our physical  being, and the need for that being to function as it is situated in a dynamic,  time-pressured world.
</blockquote>
<p>When  speaking, the body is &ldquo;&hellip;brought into the service of communication&rdquo; (Quek <a href="#QUF06">2006</a>:  388). </p>
<p>For  theorists like Dourish (<a href="#DOP04">2004</a>) and Hollan, Hutchins and Kirsh (<a href="#HOJ00">2000</a>), perception  and representation must always be seen as occurring in the context of and being  structured by an embodied agent actively engaged with the world. Dourish  describes embodiment as more than simply physical presence:</p>
<blockquote>
&hellip; by embodiment I  mean a presence and participation in the world, real-time and real-space, here  and now. Embodiment denotes a participative status, the presence and occurrence  of a phenomenon in the world. So, physical objects are certainly embodied, but  so are conversations and actions. They are things that unfold in the world, and  whose fundamental nature depends on their properties as features of the world  rather than as abstractions. So, for example, conversations are embodied  phenomena because their structure and orderliness derives from the way in which  they are enacted by participants in real-time and under the immediate  constraints of the environment in which they take place (Dourish <a href="#DOP01">2001</a>: 235).
</blockquote>
<p>
Hollan&rsquo;s  discussion of the distributed cognition perspective posits objects, artefacts  and &ldquo;at-hand&rdquo; materials and media as extensions of humans:</p>

<blockquote>It is not an  incidental matter that we have bodies locking us causally into relations with  our immediate environments (Hollan et al. <a href="#HOJ00">2000</a>: 177).</blockquote>

<p>  Drawing on  Merleau-Ponty&rsquo;s view on perception, Robertson (<a href="#ROT97">1997</a>) discusses perception as  lived cognition and cognition as embodied action, presenting a taxonomy of  embedded actions in relation to physical objects, other bodies and workspaces.</p>

<p>Clark  (<a href="#CLA99">1999</a>: 346) speaks of embodiment as &ldquo;&hellip;a kind of <em>co-ordination</em> between the inner and the outer worlds&rdquo; requiring a  &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; adjustment. He goes on to comment that:</p>

<blockquote>
A mature science of  the mind, it now seems, targets not (or not only) the individual, inner  organization of intelligence but the bodily and environmentally extended  organizations responsible for adaptive success (Clark <a href="#CLA99">1999</a>: 349).
</blockquote>

<p>Library and information science is more  than a &ldquo;science of the mind&rdquo; but there is no denying that cognition, however  conceptualized&mdash;figures strongly in our research. In pointing to biological  brains coupling themselves with special kinds of ecological objects, Clark further amplifies the work of Merleau-Ponty (<a href="#MPM62">1962</a>)  that Robertson draws on in her own work.</p>

<p>These  theoretical influences proved very significant for framing the embodiment of  human experience which is the subject of discussion in this paper. The second  part of this paper discusses examples of how this framework can inform the  study of human interactions with digital and physical objects. The embodiment  of the objects themselves is another matter, and not the subject of this paper.  However, Clark (<a href="#CLA99">1999</a>) offers a worthy  introduction to an embodied, embedded approach as it is and might be applied to  such objects.</p>

<p>Agency and  interpretation are seen as central to all social action. Action, activity and  doing become essential notions for understanding human experience. Embodiment  is about establishing meaning, which arises out of action (Dourish <a href="#DOP04">2004</a>). It is  however practice that brings action and meaning together (Dourish <a href="#DOP04">2004</a>; Hollan  et al. <a href="#HOJ00">2000</a>).</p>

<h2>Practice </h2>

<p>Practice is  about more than doing, it is a process by which one experiences the world.  Dourish&rsquo;s (<a href="#DOP04">2004</a>: 25) discussion of practice and its relation to embodied  interaction draws on Wenger&rsquo;s &ldquo;communities of practice&rdquo; (Wenger <a href="#WEE97">1997</a>), which  Dourish suggests leads to an appreciation of the generative, evolutionary  character of these practices. With specific reference to information systems,  he characterises the essential feature of embodied interaction as &ldquo;&hellip;allowing  users to negotiate and evolve systems of practice and meaning in the course of  their interactions with information systems&rdquo; (Dourish <a href="#DOP04">2004</a>: 28).</p>
<p>Building on  the work of Bourdieu (<a href="#BOP90">1990</a>) as well as Lave and Wenger (<a href="#LAJ91">1991</a>), Cook and Brown  (<a href="#CSD99">1999</a>: 388) provide a good operationalising of &ldquo;practice&rdquo;: </p>

<blockquote>
For our purposes,  then, we intend the term &ldquo;practice&rdquo; to refer to the coordinated activities of  individuals and groups in doing their &ldquo;real work&rdquo; as it is informed by a  particular organizational or group context.
</blockquote>

<p>Activity  theory, which contributed to the shift in human computer interaction research from a focus on an  isolated individual to individuals acting in a specific setting, focuses on practice much in the same way seen in Wenger  and Dourish. The contemporary form of activity theory offers a research  framework and set of perspectives that draws on the research of Vygostky and &ldquo;&hellip;  supports a view of humans as active constructors who act as whole persons in  activities and a view of social interaction as a central contributor to  cognitive change&rdquo; (Jacob <a href="#JAE92">1992</a>: 324; Nardi <a href="#NBA96">1996a</a>; Star <a href="#SSL96">1996</a>). In activity theory,  practice is not being defined in terms of a task, but in the Vygotskian sense  of an activity as &ldquo;doing in order to transform something&rdquo; (Kuutti <a href="#KUK96">1996</a>: 41). In  this sense, the study of practice brings together notions of interaction and  embodied human experience. </p>
<p>Within this  framework, even practices once assumed to be routine or rational must be  recognised as problematic, negotiated, and situated (Star <a href="#SSL96">1996</a>). Activity (in  this practice sense) has an &ldquo;embodied, inescapably &lsquo;located&rsquo; nature&rdquo; (Lave  <a href="#LAJ88">1988</a>: 148). The implication of such a view, according to Lave, is the  realisation that situated activity is &ldquo;&hellip;far more complex and contentful than  formal notions of context could contain&rdquo; (Lave <a href="#LAJ93">1993</a>: 27). Such ways of thinking  move research beyond an examination of representations and informative  artefacts (like documents, citations, computer and database information) to  focus on the way that such representations and artefacts are used.</p>
<p>Lave  endeavours to provide a social anthropology of cognition, which she defines as  &ldquo;a complex social phenomenon&rdquo; constituted in the relations between the social  system and individual experience. Observed in everyday practice, it &ldquo;&hellip;is  distributed &ndash; stretched over, not divided among&mdash;mind, body, activity and  culturally organized settings (which include other actors)&rdquo; (Lave <a href="#LAJ88">1988</a>: 1).  Lave sought to move beyond a dichotomous separation of social behaviour from  cognitive behaviour, where &ldquo;&hellip;one has system without individual experience, the  other experience without system&rdquo; (Lave <a href="#LAJ88">1988</a>: 150). Instead, <strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;&hellip;  &lsquo;cognition&rsquo; is constituted in dialectical relations among people acting, the  contexts of their activity, and the activity itself&rdquo; (Lave <a href="#LAJ88">1988</a>: 148). It is &ldquo;&hellip;  a nexus of relations between the mind at work and the world in which it works&rdquo;  (Lave <a href="#LAJ88">1988</a>: 1). She describes her approach as &ldquo;practice theory&rdquo;.<a href="#2">#2</a> </p>
<p>Lave&rsquo;s  situated exploration of context can be related to the interactionist and  interpretivist traditions employed by both library and information science and human computer interaction researchers (Blackler <a href="#BLF95">1995</a>; Hj&oslash;rland <a href="#HJB97">1997</a>; Nardi <a href="#NAB96">1996b</a>; Star <a href="#SSL96">1996</a>). Such study of individuals in  specific settings can be related to the basic premises of symbolic interaction  discussed in T.D. Anderson (<a href="#ATD03">2003</a>) and Star (<a href="#SSL96">1996</a>). Star explicitly relates the  exploration of context in activity theory research (and associated frameworks  like Lave&rsquo;s practice theory) to her own research. Thus, it is possible to find  connections between a variety of approaches to studying individuals in specific  settings and the ways in which experience shapes their behaviour. </p>
<p>In her own  comparison of frameworks for studying context in human computer interaction research, Nardi (<a href="#NAB96">1996b</a>:  96) concludes that:</p>
<blockquote>
A creative synthesis of activity theory as a backbone for analysis, leavened 
    by the focus on representations of distributed cognition, and the commitment 
    to grappling with the perplexing flux of everyday activity of the situated 
    action perspective, would seem a likely path to success.
</blockquote>

<p>Her  portrayal of activity theory as a<strong> &ldquo;</strong>powerful and clarifying descriptive  tool&rdquo; suggests it can be particularly useful for the descriptive focus of this  research (Nardi <a href="#NBA96">1996a</a>: 7). Similarly, Kaptelinin (<a href="#KAV96">1996</a>: 46) suggests that  activity theory is itself a &ldquo;special kind of tool&rdquo; and that:</p>
<blockquote>
&hellip;accepting this  perspective does not exclude other approaches and does not reject the usefulness  of other conceptual schemes (because no tool, no matter how powerful it is, can  serve all needs and help to solve all problems).
</blockquote>

<p>  This  position would seem to be confirmed by Clark (<a href="#CLA99">1999</a>), who points to the  Vyotskian influences on theorists in the area of embodied cognition.</p>

<p>In a sense,  such comments offer a bridge between epistemologies - what Cook and Brown refer  to as a &ldquo;generative dance&rdquo; (Cook &amp; Brown <a href="#CSD99">1999</a>). In this vein, the work of  Lave and Star will be presented in the second part of this paper, where it is  suggested that this common ground offers a way to adapt approaches by both of  them to a range of explorations of context in information practices.</p>

<h2>Socio-material  framings of information practices</h2>

<p>Addressing  context in <em>conceptual</em> terms is one challenge, but developing a strategy  for the <em>operational</em> exploration of context is a very different matter. Addressing context involves not only an examination of physical aspects,  but also the ways these features are defined by the informants. From the argument  presented in the previous sections, we can conclude that two conditions of  human experience are essential for library and information science research to acknowledge in the study of  information practices in context:</p>

<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>the situated, embodied character of human experience, </li>
  <li>a socio-material (and increasingly socio-technical) context needs to be brought more actively into our examinations and analysis</li>
</ol>

<p>An  embodied, &ldquo;doing&rdquo; framework for studying information practices acknowledges the  processes of individual meaning making while appreciating the social, cultural  and material contexts in which these practices are experienced. It is also  necessary to acknowledge that information practices entail working with  material objects such as information systems and documents that have a  predetermined form that an individual cannot readily alter. The challenge is to  find frameworks acknowledging the significance of all these aspects. To this  end, the remaining sections of this paper present a more detailed discussion of  two concepts arising out of philosophical positions presented above and their  merits for further application within library and information science research.</p>

<h3>Framing  context as &lsquo;setting&rsquo; and &lsquo;arena&rsquo;</h3>

<p>Lave uses a  framework based upon the emergent, contingent nature of action, portraying  context as consisting of two components, termed <em>arena</em> and <em>setting </em>(Lave  <a href="#LAJ88">1988</a>). <em>Arena</em> refers to contextual aspects not directly negotiable by the  individual: a &ldquo;physically, economically, politically, and socially organized  space-in-time&rdquo; (Lave <a href="#LAJ88">1988</a>: 150). <em>Setting</em> refers to the context created  by the individual during interaction with the <em>arena</em> &ndash;including  interaction with other individuals. The focus is on neither the individual nor  the environment, but the relation between the two. </p>
<p>Context is  not a single entity, but interplay between the <em>arena</em> and the <em>setting</em>.  For Lave, the relationship between these two components reflects the different  uses of the term <em>context</em>. <em>Arena</em> addresses connotations of context  as:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip;an identifiable,  durable framework for activity, with properties that transcend the experience  of individuals, exist prior to them, and are entirely beyond their control  (Lave <a href="#LAJ88">1988</a>: 151).
</blockquote>

<p>The notion  of <em>setting</em> relates to connotations of context as a unique, individual  experience.</p>

<p>The setting  of an activity is one way of conceptualising relations between the organisation  of the arena within which activity takes place and the structure of the  experiences and expectations of people as actors. The setting is more than a  mental map in the individual&rsquo;s mind, &ldquo;&hellip;it has simultaneously an independent,  physical character and a potential for realization only in relation to [an  informant&rsquo;s] activity&rdquo; (Lave <a href="#LAJ88">1988</a>: 152-3). A person&rsquo;s experience of an activity  involves the interplay between setting and arena. The setting is both generator  of the activity and generated out of it: &ldquo;In short, activity is dialectically  constituted in relation with the setting&rdquo; (Lave <a href="#LAJ88">1988</a>: 151). There are  constraints and constructions simultaneously at work on an individual&rsquo;s  experience of context.</p>

<p>Experience  transforms the setting within the arena. Moreover, any change in the setting  also transforms the activity taking place within it. Addressing context is only  part of a holistic analysis of practice, as Lave duly acknowledges. However, as  will be shown through two illustrations, her framework for dealing with context  &ldquo;in the technical sense&rdquo; as she calls it, can prove very useful for our own  theorizing of information practices.</p>

<h3>Illustration  1: information retrieval system as &lsquo;setting&rsquo; and &lsquo;arena&rsquo;</h3>

<p>Reading  Lave&rsquo;s ethnographic analysis of the shoppers&rsquo; experiences in the supermarket,  it is easy to get a sense of how this approach might relate to the experiences  of searchers using an information retrieval system, or of any number of other  information practices for that matter. Lave describes a shopper&rsquo;s progress  through the aisles of a supermarket, with its ordered arrangement of items on  shelves. She writes about the supermarket as the &ldquo;ultimate grocery list&rdquo; and  the shopper&rsquo;s own list, observing how differences of scale compel a shopper to  create a particular route through the store &ndash; a unique search strategy if you  like. Her descriptions of personal navigation, information overload, and  individual expectations about the process of shopping (Lave <a href="#LAJ88">1988</a>: 152-4) mirror  descriptions of searcher interaction with databases or networked information  systems.</p>
<p>Adapting  Lave&rsquo;s framework, the information retrieval system as <em>arena</em> recognises  the physical characteristics of the environment in which searching and  retrieval is performed. It also encompasses less tangible aspects of this  structured framework such as the selection, presentation and arrangement of  citations contained in a particular database that are outside a searcher&rsquo;s  direct control. At the same time, a searcher&rsquo;s experience of the information  retrieval system is a selective experience, in a similar manner to the  shopper&rsquo;s experience of the market reported by Lave. In the  supermarket-as-settingsome aisles do not exist for a shopper &ldquo;&hellip;while  other aisles are rich in detailed possibilities&rdquo; (Lave <a href="#LAJ88">1988</a>: 151).<strong> </strong>Describing  the setting of such a system as a &ldquo;personally ordered and edited version&rdquo; (p  151) is consistent with our understandings of the differences between &lsquo;system&rsquo;  and &lsquo;user&rsquo; orientations to information seeking and information retrieval  situations (e.g.: Eisenberg &amp; Barry <a href="#EMB88">1988</a>; Hert <a href="#HCA97">1997</a>; Hj&oslash;rland <a href="#HJB97">1997</a>;  Kuhlthau <a href="#KCC99">1999</a>). </p>
<h3>Illustration  2: document as &lsquo;setting&rsquo; and &lsquo;arena&rsquo;</h3>
<p>To  illustrate the applicability of Lave&rsquo;s framework to an even more specific  object, we turn now to documents -- or more precisely in this example -- a  book.&nbsp; Figure 1 provides a recent  snapshot of my own well-used copy of Bowker &amp; Star&rsquo;s <em>Sorting things out:  classification and its consequences </em>(<a href="#BGC99">1999</a>). The annotation practice evident  in this photo is a consequence of my interest in protecting the soft-cover  book, a desire to engage deeply with the book&rsquo;s contents and an evolving  fascination with post-it notes! </p>
<p>The  document as <em>arena</em> in this instance is  the fixed form in which I first encountered this artefact. As with the  supermarket and information system described earlier, this form is not directly  negotiable by me. However, as is indicated by all the annotations and markings  in and around this fixed form, I have been actively engaged in creating my own  version of this artefact. There is no formalised set of rules applied to this  annotation practice. Rather it evolves in response to different contexts of use  for the book (e.g.: teaching a subject on classification, unpacking notions of  standardization and boundary object for a research project, supervising a  health information management PhD). Moreover, the &ldquo;rules&rdquo; that are generated  are also shaped by the availability of the annotation tools themselves (e.g.:  ink colours for writing, and size and colour of post-it notes). Document as <em>setting</em> corresponds with my efforts to  reshape the book in so far as is possible to do so -- relating to the text and  responding to the fixed form by creating my own markers, which vary in size,  colour and location. Once again, as in the first illustration, experience  transforms the setting within the arena. My practice shapes the structure and  the structure shapes my practice.</p>

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 1: The author&rsquo;s  copy of &ldquo;Sorting Things Out&rdquo;</strong></div>


<h3>Value  for library and information science</h3>

<p>As Suchman  and Trigg (<a href="#SLA93">1993</a>: 144) point out, Lave&rsquo;s framework addresses both &ldquo;&hellip;the social  and the material structuring of specifically situated activity systems.&rdquo;<strong> </strong>The  interplay between a system or a document as both <em>setting </em>and <em>arena</em> encourages us to avoid unnatural dichotomies in searcher-system or  individual-object relations and to consider them instead as emergent  constructions. This way of seeing context seems well suited to our examination  of information practices. There are no simple dichotomies between the structure  of an information retrieval system or the book and its content. Nor can an  individual&rsquo;s experience of the system and its content be completely separated  from its structure. Applying Lave&rsquo;s framework, the structure of the information  system or informative artefact, beyond the control of the individual, becomes  part of the arena in which practice is observed. A person&rsquo;s interpretation of  that structure is represented in the notion of setting.</p>

<p>In the  first illustration, the searcher may be working with a subset of a larger  system, but as library and information science researchers have long acknowledged (see for example: Bates  <a href="#BMJ02">2002</a>; Hj&oslash;rland <a href="#HJB02">2002</a>), there are cascading effects across layers in any system,  however defined. The &ldquo;setting&rdquo; and &ldquo;arena&rdquo; depiction of the system in use  suggests we can view the practices unfolding in the context of the use of one  part of that system while simultaneously recognising the potential influence of  those cascading effects. From the searcher&rsquo;s perspective it also draws in both  fixed and fluid elements at play in the system. The adaptive behavior described  in relation to these annotation practices illustrates Clark&rsquo;s point about the  way humans and their tools combine to &ldquo;augment and enhance&rdquo; biological  cognition (Clark <a href="#CLA99">1999</a>). Furthermore, the  theoretical underpinnings of Lave&rsquo;s framework make us mindful of the social  forms of interaction that are present even in a seemingly individual  interaction with an information system or text. </p>

<p>A document  is a number of different things; it is an artefact that can serve different purposes  and be used in different ways. In the second illustration, the annotations made  by the user (in this instance, the author of this paper) augment the book,  offering evidence of her engagement with a particular document and its  contents. The annotations (represented by the various post-it notes and other  markers) served various purposes, ranging from individual meaning-making (e.g.:  identifying appropriate content for different purposes) to information sharing  (e.g.: contributing to the crafting of examples for lectures or formulating  discussion points for exchanges with research colleagues). Thus, this  augmentation contributed to understanding, interpreting and applying the ideas  represented in those contents. The Lave framework enables this individual perspective  to coexist alongside the more fixed &ldquo;arena&rdquo; arrangement of the printed book.</p>

<p>As  informative artefacts, documents can link people to other documents and to  people as well (Anderson <a href="#ATD06">2006</a> , <a href="#ATDip">in press</a>; Hertzum &amp; Pejtersen <a href="#HEM00">2000</a>). Anderson&rsquo;s informants  talk about the ideas&mdash;and the people&mdash; behind the representation (e.g.:  citation, abstract, document) they are examining or encountering at any given  moment. In this way interaction and collaboration can be appreciated even  within seemingly individual tasks (Anderson  <a href="#ATDip">in press</a>). A document is a way to get to the ideas being communicated, though &ldquo;&hellip;the  business of finding documents &hellip;is a contingent and specifically situated inquiry  (Suchman, Trigg, &amp; Blomberg <a href="#SUL02">2002</a>: 170). Looking for informing documents intertwines  with looking for informed people. As Hertzum and Pejtersen (<a href="#HEM00">2000</a>: 776) found:</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip;engineers search  for documents to find people, search for people to get documents, and interact  socially to get both oral and written information without engaging in explicit  searches.
</blockquote>

<p>  Such  practices intertwine formal and informal information seeking, material and  social qualities of the document, suggesting a need to be able to develop  frameworks that show us both the social and the material.</p>

<h2>Boundary  object and informative artefacts</h2>
<h3>Framing  the boundary object</h3>
<p>The  boundary object is a conception introduced by Star (see for example: Bowker  &amp; Star <a href="#BGC99">1999</a>; Star &amp; Griesemer <a href="#SSL89">1989</a>) to explain objects that inhabit  multiple contexts &ndash; all at the same time &ndash; whilst having both local and shared  meaning:</p>
<blockquote>
Boundary objects  are those objects that both inhabit several communities of practice and satisfy  the informational requirements of each of them (Bowker &amp; Star <a href="#BGC99">1999</a>: 297).
</blockquote>
<p>  These  objects thus appear to be robust enough to travel across contexts and between  communities of practice in an identifiable form, yet flexible or &ldquo;plastic&rdquo;  enough to take on the meaning of the local context. Thus, they serve a key role  in developing and maintaining coherence across these communities.</p>
<p>Star and  Griesemer (<a href="#SSL89">1989</a>: 410-2) explore the translation work involved in the  representation and re-representation of such objects. They discuss four  analytical distinctions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
  <li>Repositories (ordered &ldquo;piles&rdquo;       of objects indexed in some standardized fashion);</li>
  <li>Ideal type (objects that do not       accurately describe details of any one locality but are instead abstracted       from all domains: &ldquo;&hellip;a means of communicating and cooperating symbolically&rdquo;       (p410));</li>
  <li>Coincident boundaries (common       objects with same boundaries but different internal contexts);</li>
  <li>Standardised forms (devised as       methods of common communication across dispersed work groups; Latour&rsquo;s       &ldquo;immutable mobiles&rdquo; (p411)).</li>
</ul>
<p>Bowker and  Star (<a href="#BGC99">1999</a>) build on this to examine representations (and re-representations)  in the context of standardization and classification practices. They also build  on Star and Griesemer&rsquo;s discussion of marginal people, who straddle more than  one social world thereby serving important boundary shaping and boundary  crossing functions.</p>
<p>This  conception has received wide acceptance in a number of disciplines. For Roth  and McGinn (<a href="#RWM98">1998</a>) boundary objects are inscriptions used across communities of  practice and as such are a critical feature of their theoretical approach to  embodied representations. For them, boundary objects serve as &ldquo;&hellip;interfaces  between multiple social worlds and facilitate the flow of resources  (information, concepts, skills, materials) among multiple social actors (Roth  &amp; McGinn <a href="#RWM98">1998</a>: 42). The focus turns from representation as a mental activity  to one of inscription as a social activity.</p>
<h3>Illustration  1: information retrieval system as boundary object</h3>
<p>Not  surprisingly, the &ldquo;repository&rdquo; type of boundary object is a relatively easy fit  for the information retrieval system. People from different worlds (across time  and space, disciplines, skill and requirement levels) can take advantage of its  modularity and borrow from the &ldquo;pile&rdquo; without worrying about their different  purposes. We can also see how it can be considered a &ldquo;standardized form&rdquo; at a number  of levels: the ordering schemes used to arrange the documents, the indexing  scheme that manages the citations/records, the interface that provides access  to those contents and representations. </p>
<p>Different  communities can and do inscribe different meanings on the information  represented in a single database. At a university, for instance, different  levels of experience, expertise and purpose do not stop undergraduate and  postgraduate students, researchers and instructors borrowing from the same  &ldquo;pile&rdquo; of informative artefacts. The standardized structures and metadata  available to all communities allow information to be shared and accessed by  different disciplinary communities.</p>
<p>However, at  a deeper level, viewing the information retrieval system as a boundary object  passing between communities reminds us of the different meanings that such a  system can have in user, designer and manager communities. As a  &ldquo;socio-technical system&rdquo; it is a complex and interdependent system of dynamic  and interrelated elements involving people (e.g. content providers, searchers,  database managers), tools (hardware, software, machines) and information  structures (content, rules, controls) (Kling, <a href="#KLR99">1999</a>).&nbsp; In this instance, the boundary being crossed  concerns the design and evaluation of a system from these different  perspectives. This portrayal allows us to pay special attention to people in  various roles and relationships with each other and with other system elements.  It also enables the researcher who wishes to investigate such a system in a  holistic fashion to examine the changing roles of and responses to information  structures, content and content providers, and system access. </p>
<h3>Illustration  2: document as boundary object</h3>
<p>Fittingly,  we return to Figure 1, a text that discusses the notion of the boundary object  itself. A recent conversation with a colleague from another discipline about  this particular artefact provided compelling evidence for the way that such  documents act as boundary objects. The topic unexpectedly arose &ndash; largely as a  consequence of the writing of this paper. We discovered that both of us had  copies of the book on our shelves, that both of us enjoyed reading it and that  we both used it in our teaching and research. However, it was also clear that  we came at the ideas in the book from different perspectives and took different  interpretations and judgments of its significance away from our individual  readings of it. Nevertheless, the book (as both a physical entity and as a  representation of ideas) proved to be instrumental in enabling us to straddle  our different communities and forge a shared understanding about what we came  to recognize as common interests. This experience is reminiscent of the &ldquo;social  life&rdquo; of documents that Brown and Duguid (<a href="#BJS96">1996</a>) describe.</p>
<h3>Value  for library and information science</h3>
<p>Representing  &ndash; and re-representing &ndash; information is at the heart of library and information science theory and practice.  The boundary object notion helps us to recognize informative artefacts (e.g.:  books, documents, database records, citations, abstracts) as socio-material  forms. Seeing the &ldquo;object&rdquo; (whether it is as concrete as a book or as dispersed  as a networked information retrieval system) as having properties and  significance that can change across communities helps us to understand better  the human processes associated with working with those artefacts. As Berg  observes, technologies &ldquo;&hellip;participate in the ordering of social collectives  (such as communities, nations, work practices)&hellip;&rdquo; (<a href="#BEM98">1998</a>: 457). </p>
<p>Furthermore,  the close association between boundary objects and the notion of inscription  can change &ldquo;&hellip;the location of representing activity from individual minds to  social arenas&rdquo; (Roth &amp; McGinn <a href="#RWM98">1998</a>: 37). Inscription-related activities are  part of networks of social practices. Furthermore, as pieces of craftwork, inscriptions,  serve a vital function of &ldquo;&hellip;making things visible for material, rhetorical,  institutional, and political purposes (Roth &amp; McGinn <a href="#RWM98">1998</a>: 54). </p>
<p>A second  notion closely associated with boundary objects is articulation, which draws  attention to such &ldquo;representational devices&rdquo; (Suchman &amp; Trigg <a href="#SLA93">1993</a>: 144) as  central actors in the structuring of practice and of technologies &ldquo;as the  alignments of material and discursive practice&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
Making technologies  is, in consequence, a practice of configuring new alignments between the social  and the material that are both localised and able to travel, stable and  reconfigurable, intelligibly familiar and recognizably new (Suchman et al.,  <a href="#SUL02">2002</a>: 164).
</blockquote>
<p>These  observations by Suchman and colleagues merit particular consideration for  research of information systems, as they were focusing particularly on  technologies incorporating practices of coding and classification. Making the  invisible more visible helps us appreciate the work required to construct and  deploy coherent technologies (Suchman <a href="#SLA02">2002</a>). Becoming more mindful of these  sociomaterial connections contributes to a fuller understanding of the way that  documents (or citations/records, in the case of an information system) become  representations of knowledge. </p>
<p>Representation  and representing practices are significant concerns for the library and information science community.  Thus, greater attention to articulation work can contribute important insights.  Information networks, what Kling referred to as the &ldquo;web of computing&rdquo; (<a href="#KLR82">1982</a>)  comprise technology and human elements: an ensemble of artefacts, skills,  applications, infrastructures, technological and human work are intertwined in  this web. However:</p>
<blockquote>
Neither one -- the  restrictive, constraining behaviour of the artifact -- nor the skilled flexible  activities within local sites -- can stand alone. The power of such ensembles  likes in the contact between the two domains (Berg <a href="#BEM98">1998</a>: 471).
</blockquote>

<p>Using the  boundary object as an analytical tool places focus on that contact.</p>

<h2>Closing  comments: situated information practices</h2>

<p>Whether we  are examining the information practices of an individual or a group, both the  approaches illustrated in this paper draw attention to the social realm in  which even seemingly individual practices takes place. Where collaboration and  interaction are even more explicit, we might appreciate their theoretical value  even more. </p>
<p>Information  systems are obvious sites of socio-technical relations, but as the discussion  of Figure 1 demonstrates, working with documents may be a socio-material  information practice that need not be computer-mediated. Thus, the two  approaches described in this paper (setting and arena; boundary object) can  prove useful in a wide range of contexts. Dourish reminds us, however, that our  contemporary information landscape is increasingly becoming digital: </p>
<blockquote>
In this world, our  primary experience of computation is not with a traditional desktop computer,  but rather with a range of computationally-enhanced devices &ndash; pieces of paper,  pens, walls, books, hammers, etc (Dourish <a href="#DOP04">2004</a>: 19). 
</blockquote>

<p>  The world  that Dourish describes warrants attention by library and information science researchers, for it is in this  world that people will be working with information and information artefacts.</p>
<p>This paper  sought to demonstrate two approaches that can be useful for identifying and  analysing the context of information practices, building on their ancestral  links rather than their conceptual differences. In a book presenting various  perspectives on activity and context, Lave recounts how the contributors to the  volume urged her &ldquo;&hellip;to convey the spirit of the commitment &hellip; to the value of the <em>differences</em> among our theoretical positions &hellip; [which] &hellip; offer multiple  possibilities for interrogating social experience&rdquo; (Lave <a href="#LAJ93">1993</a>: 28). Rather than  focus on conflicting positions, she continues, the contributors sought &ldquo;&hellip;to  produce positive accounts of our changing understanding of how to investigate  social practice&rdquo; (Lave <a href="#LAJ93">1993</a>: 28). The spirit of this discussion, it seems to  me, could be very helpful for our own investigations of information practices.  Once we have been able to bridge the epistemological divides that can separate  researchers in different disciplines (like human computer interaction and library and information science) and theoretical  traditions (like activity theory and situated practice), we will have more powerful  frameworks for dealing with our contemporary information landscape.</p>

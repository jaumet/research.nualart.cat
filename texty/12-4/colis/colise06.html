<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The work of libraries and librarians of the 21st century and
consequently Library and Information Science (library and information science) education is
increasingly characterised by a necessity to include information
literacy (information literacy) into the curricula. information literacy thus undoubtedly gained an
important place also in library and information science education. information literacy however often goes beyond the
most basic and most important skills of recognizing a need for
information, finding and critically evaluating information. </p>
<p>Coupling information literacy and communication in library and information science education has strong potential
and possibilities that have to be studied. The purpose of this paper is
to examine this potential. </p>
<p>We begin by presenting some of the definitions of information literacy. As part of our
argument we will reiterate that information literacy is of interdisciplinary nature
characterized by the presence of ties to linguistics and will define
what types of communication can be related to information literacy.</p>
<p>We will also discuss the deficiencies of approaches that narrow down
information literacy to some kind of electronic literacy and discuss the necessity of
integrating information literacy into library and information science curricula. We will also examine the literature
related to information literacy and writing (composition) instruction in the higher
education of the United States and will shortly examine some aspects of
academic literacy, the ability to read, interpret, and produce
information valued in academia. The paper concludes by stating a need
of a cognitive enquiry that would throw light on the nature of
processes underlying information literacy.</p>
<h3>Definitions of information literacy</h3>
<p>What is information literacy? How does its notion and application influence library and information science education? </p>
Information literacy is used both as an umbrella term that encompasses
computer, internet (or network), digital and media literacies as well
as one of these. There seems to be a consensus forming that the former
is the more correct approach to this question. <p>A well-known definition of information literacy is the one developed by the American Library Association (<a href="#ALA">ALA 1989, 1</a>)
"Information literate [people] are not only able to recognize when
information is needed, but they are also able to identify, locate,
evaluate, and use effectively information needed for the particular
decision or issue at hand. The information literate person, therefore,
is empowered for effective decision making, freedom of choice, and full
participation in a democratic society." </p>
<p> Varis (<a href="#Varis">2003</a>) directs our attention to the fact
that there are many more definitions of information literacy,
nonetheless they all contain the following personal competencies: </p><ul>
<li><a>Recognition of an information need;</a></li>
<li><a>Development of a search strategy and selection of sources;</a></li>
<li><a>Evaluation, synthesis;</a></li>
<li><a>Effective use of the new information.</a></li></ul>
<p><a>The latter one directs our attention to the communicative aspects of information literacy.

</a></p><p><a>Information literacy is often mentioned together with the
concept of critical thinking skills, as well as with problem-based and
lifelong learning (</a><a href="#Roes">Roes 2001</a>)</p>
<h3>The linguistic nature of information literacy</h3>
<p>As Hjorland (<a href="#Hor">2000</a>) points out library and information science is a
professional domain that draws on many kinds of knowledge, among others
language and communication skills. And, indeed, the interdisciplinary
nature of library and information science is well known (<a href="#Sara">Saracevic 1999</a>).
If we agree that information literacy is closely tied to library and information science it inherits its interdisciplinary connections.
Among these there are psychology, linguistics and psycholinguistics (<a href="#Webber"> Webber and Johnston 2000</a>). </p>
<p>Limberg and Sundin (<a href="#Limb">2006</a>) argue that information
seeking research and information literacy education do not influence
each other in the way that they have potential to do. This means that
information literacy education would benefit from using concepts and
models from information seeking research. We argue in a similar vein,
but our argument is related to verbal communication.
Just like Attfield, Blandford &amp; Dowell (<a href="#Attfield">2003</a>) who argue that information seeking can be put
into the context of writing as writing is amongst the most common tasks within which information seeking is embedded.</p>
<h3>Different understandings of communication </h3>
<p>information literacy is characterized by the presence of communication in different
understandings. Dealing with communication is not uncommon in library and information science
education. Most Hungarian library and information science curricula, for example, contain some
class of the basics of communication often addressing both the theory
of communication and practical communication skills.
This is done not haphazardly. One of the a broader educational contexts
of library and information science is given by communication studies (<a href="#Hor">Hjorland 2000</a>).</p>
<p>We also know that many processes of library and information
activities, especially reference and user education are based in many
regards on communication and require communication skills. </p>
<p>The definitions of information literacy often show that information literacy takes shape in a process of communication. Limberg and Sundin (<a href="#Limb">2006</a>)
speak about an approach to information literacy education and to information literacy
itself that emphasizes the social and communicative aspects of
information seeking practices. </p>
<p>We however want to stress an understanding of communication in
relationship with information literacy in a simple and straightforward way. We state
namely that information literacy and (predominantly) verbal communication are closely
connected in many regards as information literacy includes the abilities and the
activities of reading and writing.</p>
<h2>The argument</h2>
<p>Before arguing for the necessity to couple information literacy and communication we have
to examine why and where is it needed. It seems also to be useful to
explain the role of libraries and librarians in information literacy.</p>
<h3>The need for information literacy</h3>

<p>Information literacy has its roots in library user education.
Nowadays it has significance within education in a wider sense. When
exercising information literacy we handle complex situations and follow
patterns of behaviour. This is the feature of information literacy that makes it
applicable in the educational context. </p>

<p>The rapid development of digital technologies resulted in a
proliferation of information sources and caused information overload.
This development serves as the basis for the information society and
the knowledge economy that require competent information customers and
informed workforce. Information literacy developed to meet these
challenges and requirements (<a href="#Andretta"> Andretta 2005</a>).
This is the point where and this is the reason why library user
education became information literacy, and this is why information literacy acquired
especial importance recently even if the existence of its notion can be
traced back to the 1970s (<a href="#Roes">Roes 2001</a>).
<p>Explaining the general importance of information literacy Virkus (<a href="#Virkus">2003</a>)
cites the following observation by the OECD &#8220;The knowledge-based
economy is characterized by the need for continuous learning of both
codified information and the competencies to use this information. As
access to information becomes easier and less expensive, the skills and
competencies relating to the selection and efficient use of information
become more crucial... Capabilities for selecting relevant and
discarding irrelevant information, recognizing patterns in information,
interpreting and decoding information as well as learning new and
forgetting old skills are in increasing demand&#8221; (<a href="#OECD"> OECD 1996, 13</a>).
</p>


<p>Harmonizing with this an expert meeting of the UNESCO declared that:</p>

<ul>
<li><a>Information literacy is a concern to all sectors of society and should be tailored by each to meet its specific context; </a>
</li><li><a>Information literacy enables people to access information about their health, their environment, their education and work; </a>
</li><li><a>There is a need to embed information literacy in the
curriculum at primary, secondary and tertiary levels, as well as in the
training for information professionals, including education and health
care workers (</a><a href="#THEM"> Thematic Debate 2005</a>). </li></ul>

<h3>The role of the library and of librarians</h3>

<p>Librarians are educated in collecting, evaluating, organizing and providing access to information thus they possess appropriate knowledge and skills. This means that librarians are potentially equipped with all the
abilities and skills necessary not only to be information literate but to teach information literacy to other persons.  Without getting a proper education themselves however they will not be able to fulfil this role.
</p>

<p>In other words, to be able to act as providers of information
literacy for the community, librarians first have to acquire
competencies themselves and to have an opportunity to upgrade their
skills constantly (<a href="#Virkus"> Virkus 2003</a>).
</p>

<p>As Jones (<a href="#Jones">1996</a>) points out, &#8220;the knowledge domain of the librarian
is the acquisition and evaluation of information resources.
The librarian usually does nothing more with this knowledge base beyond offer it succinctly and freely to those
who request it. This evaluation of resources across subject domains, selecting the valid and useful, is common practice
of librarians. Free from the coaching presence of the librarian, the online information seeker must exercise these skills
independently.&#8221; </p>

<h3>E-literacy only?</h3>

<p>The review on the concepts of information and digital literacies by Bawden (<a href="#Bawden">2001</a>)
also shows that information literacy and e-literacy (digital literacy,
information technology literacy, computer literacy) are two
interrelated but different concepts. The former is concerned with
content and communication, the latter with an understanding of the
technological infrastructure.
</p>

<p>Bundy (<a href="#Bundyb">2004b</a>) wants us to be aware of myths about information literacy.
</p>

<p>The first myth is that information literacy is about using information and communication technologies
effectively. There seems to be no evidence that the huge investments
into information and communication technologies would have brought improved student performance despite thefact that e-literacy has become a prerequisite for information
literacy. </p>

<p>In his another writing it is also Bundy (<a href="#Bundya">2004a</a>)
who says that the sheer abundance of information and technology will
not in itself create more informed citizens without a complementary
understanding and capacity to use information effectively. What is
really needed &#8211; he says &#8211; is technology mediated but not technology
focused pedagogy. </p>

<p>A second myth is that students entering higher education are
information literate because student centred, resource based and ICT
focused learning are pervasive in secondary education. Despite the
rhetoric about educational change this is not true. We have to add that
this is true not only in Australia but basically everywhere.
</p>

<p>A third myth about information literacy development is that it
can be addressed largely by continuing traditional library user
education that again seems to underestimate the need for change. A
fourth myth is that information literacy is just about information,
rather than about learning how to learn (<a href="#Bundyb"> Bundy 2004b</a>).
</p>

<p>Our attempt to widen the horizon of library and information science education towards information literacy and
communication addresses only a small segment of these complex issues. </p>

<h3>Integrating information literacy into library and information science curricula</h3>
<p>The basic requirements for integrating information literacy into library and information science education have been fixed in
2005 by Virkus <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#Virkuse">2005</a>)</p>
<p>library and information science students are required:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a>To be aware of information literacy as a concept; </a>
</li><li><a>To become information literate themselves; </a>
</li><li><a>To learn about some key aspects of teaching information literacy. </a></li></ul>
<p>Key aspects include: </p>
<ul>
<li><a>Key definitions and models of information literacy; </a>
</li><li><a>Different contexts for information literacy; </a>
</li><li><a>The relationship of information literacy with other literacies; </a>
</li><li><a>The relationship between information literacy and other library and information science skill and knowledge areas (e.g. Knowledge Management, Information Retrieval); </a>
</li><li><a>Key models and theories; </a>
</li><li><a>The functions and scope of key information literacy organisations and initiatives; </a>
</li><li><a>The history and origins of information literacy (</a><a href="#Virkuse">Virkus <em>et al.</em>2005</a>).</li></ul>
<p>Integration of information literacy into whatever curricula requires either creating
new courses for this purpose or integration information literacy to already existing
courses. The latter seems to be the most appropriate approach.
</p><p>In the case of library and information science it is difficult to associate information literacy with any
particular course of curricula. information literacy thus could be &#8220;built in&#8221; in some
courses. </p><p>There should be at least a minimal framework of information literacy in library and information science education that could contain the following elements:
</p><ul>
<li><a>Literacy, functional literacy (in the original sense),
</a></li><li><a>The different literacies (Internet, digital etc.); </a>
</li><li><a>Literacy as an umbrella term; </a>
</li><li><a>The definition of information literacy (e.g. the ALA definition); </a>
</li><li><a>The importance of information literacy for information professionals in context of the changing role of library
and lifelong learning.</a></li></ul>
<p>This minimal framework has been put into practice in the library and information science
programme at Szent István University, Hungary. information literacy figures in the course
&#8220;Information systems&#8221;.
</p><h3>information literacy and verbal communication</h3>
<p>The before mentioned review of Bawden (<a href="#Bawden">2001</a>)
shows that some understandings of literacy involve the integration of
listening, speaking, reading, writing, and numeracy. information literacy also may
include a cultural knowledge which enables us to recognize and use
language appropriate to different social situations: among others
thinking and questioning. </p>
<p><em>Greater Expectations</em>, a document of the Association of
American Colleges and Universities goes somewhat furter. It envisions
&#8220;empowered&#8221; and informed learners who are able to effectively
communicate orally, visually, in writing, and in a second language (<a href="#AACU">AACU 2002</a>).</p>
<p>Coupling information literacy with communication relates information literacy to literacy and functional literacy
in their traditional sense. As &#8211; among others &#8211; Varis (<a href="#Varis">2003</a>) points out,
literacy itself has many definitions. It relates to an individual&#8217;s ability to understand printed text
and to communicate through print.
Functional literacy is not different in this regard. Still, most commonly it denotes the ability to read
and use information essential for everyday life (<a href="#Bawden">Bawden 2001</a>).

</p><p>Shapiro and Hughes (<a href="#Shap">1996</a>) speak about seven
dimensions of literacy. One of these is
publishing literacy that encompasses the ability to format and publish
research and ideas electronically, in textual and multimedia forms.
They put information literacy in a broad context by comparing it to the trivium of basic
liberal arts (grammar, logic and rhetoric) was to the educated person
in medieval society.</p>
<p>This approach is the basis of the big six model. Beside of activities that can be attributed to any planned activity, the model
contains a number of elements that pertain to verbal communication, that are the following: </p>
<p></p><ul>
<li><a> Engage with information (read, view, listen) [Step 4, Information use];</a>
</li><li><a> Extract information [Step 4, Information use]</a>;
</li><li><a> Present information [Step 5, Synthesis];</a>
</li><li><a> Judge the product (effectiveness) [Step 6, Evaluation];</a>
</li><li><a> Judge the process (efficiency) [Step 6, Evaluation] (</a><a href="#Eis"> Eisenberg 2007</a>).
</li></ul>
Evaluation through judging both the product and the process is useful
for many processes however it is especially characteristic for writing
activities. <p>
Loo and Chung (<a href="#Loo">2006</a>) add to this that the
big six theory does not include every aspect of an information literacy
course. Students often do not have the proper writing and citing
skills, they are not able to delineate their and others&#8217; contributions.
The latter is related to plagiarism that is often dealt with in the
literature of writing instruction, though it is not exclusively a
communication issue, but an ethical one. This nonetheless shows the
complexity of information literacy education and interrelatedness with different problems
of varied origin. The agenda proposed by Loo and Chung (<a href="#Loo">2006</a>)
contains new elements. They dedicate a separate heading to the
communication and presentation of information that includes the
following issues: </p>
<ul>
<li><a>selection of the communication medium for the intended purpose and audience;</a>
</li><li><a>integration of new and prior information/knowledge;</a>
</li><li><a>citation styles and formal referenced report; </a>
</li><li><a> delineation of one&#8217;s own and others&#8217; contributions;</a>
</li><li><a>oral presentation. </a>
</li></ul>
<p>Under &#8220;Evaluation&#8221; they include extraction and summarization of information that are of especial interest
as they are the main components of classification, subject indexing and abstracting
and are of undoubtedly linguistic nature.(About some of the processes see, e.g.<a href="#Kol"> Koltay 1997</a>.)</p>

<p>There is a relatively big number of papers examining different issues related to information literacy education in connection with writing
(composition) instruction in the higher education of the United States and especially in regard to
year 1 students (<a href="#Jabro">Jabro and Corinth 2005</a>, <a href="#Samson">Samson and Granath 2004</a>, <a href="#Sult">Sult and Mills 2006</a>).</p>
<p>The experiences of the US higher education (HE) however could be useful beyond the Anglo-Saxon educational system
especially as the HE in the European Union experiences the Bologna reform designed to change it. </p>
<p>As an example of synthesis of information literacy and writing or rather an organic inclusion of information literacy into a writing programme can be seen
the Multimedia Writing and Technical Communication course at Arizona State University East, reported by D&#8217;Angelo and Maid (<a href="#Angelo">2004</a>).
This programme builds on rhetorical knowledge of which we should mention
the understanding the role of a variety of technologies in
communicating information and the ability of using appropriate
technologies to communicate information. Under the heading &#8220;Critical
Thinking, Reading, and Writing&#8221; the following points are especially
noteworthy: </p>
<p></p><ul>
<li><a>Using information, writing, and reading for learning, thinking, and communicating; </a>
</li><li><a>Understanding that research, like writing, is a series of
tasks, including accessing, retrieving, evaluating, analyzing, and
synthesizing appropriate information from varied sources; </a>
</li><li><a>Understanding the relationships among language, knowledge, and power; </a>
</li><li><a>Recognizing, understanding, and analyzing the context
within which language, information, and knowledge are communicated and
presented; </a></li></ul>
<p>Some of the above aspects are put as processes. Such points are, for example, the following ones: </p>
<p></p><ul>
<li><a>Using appropriate technologies to manage information collected or generated for future use. </a>
</li><li><a>Learning to critique our own and others&#8217; works;</a>
</li><li><a>Learning to balance the advantages of relying on others with the responsibility of doing our part; </a>
</li></ul>
<p>The last two processes are related to critical thinking and plagiarism. </p>
Jones (<a href="#Jones">1996</a>) enumerates a number of criteria that pertain to critical thinking. Let us see the most important ones.
<ul>
<li><a>Differentiating between fact and opinion; </a>
</li><li><a>Examining underlying assumptions, including our own ones; </a>
</li><li><a>Looking for explanations, causes and solutions; </a>
</li><li><a>Being aware of fallacious arguments, ambiguity, and manipulative reasoning; </a>
</li><li><a>Focusing on the whole picture, while examining the specifics; </a>
</li><li><a>Looking for reputable sources. </a></li></ul>

<p>The remark on critiquing our own and others&#8217; works reminds us of the following words
of Adams (<a href="#Adams">2003</a>) cited by Bundy (<a href="#Bundya">2004a</a>)
about information literate citizens, who are able to &#8220;Read more widely,
see more clearly, think more clearly, challenge authorities on every
occasion, more importantly challenge themselves.&#8221; We have to be aware
of the fact however that the above competencies are part of a degree
programme geared towards professional specification thus they go
outside any general framework of information literacy.</p>
<p>The knowledge of conventions is also of importance as it relates again
to the use of technology as well as to stressing a &#8220;traditional&#8221; writing issue, genre knowledge.</p>
<p>All the above competencies show the complexity of writing and the
numerous ties it has with information literacy. The use of technology, information
management and other processes show one of the closest ties. As to
writing itself the knowledge of conventions is not only important in
itself, but as a wider context that has to be (or could be) acquired in
the framework of information literacy education. Genre knowledge builds on the basic
rhetorical issues like the ones of purpose, audience and tone (<a href="#Ahmad">Ahmad and McMahon 2006</a>).
</p><p>Attfield, Blandford &amp; Dowell (<a href="#Attfield">2003</a>) direct our attention
to the interplay between text production and reflection on the text produced.
The writer is devoted to the task of turning ideas into text. They then read the text to form
new ideas and to make decisions about what has to be written and how should it be organised.
Reflecting to texts includes information seeking as an analytic activity. </p>
<p>One of the most important issues of information seeking and also of
information literacy is relevance that appears in linguistic contexts, as well. One of
the important assumptions of the relevance theory elaborated by <em>Sperber and Wilson</em> is that every utterance has a variety of possible interpretations,
all compatible with the information that is linguistically encoded (<a href="#Wilson"> Wilson 1994</a>).
This assumption seems to be appropriate for information literacy where finding the appropriate interpretation occurs in wider contexts.</p>
<p>Analysis and synthesis are central to many activities covered by library and information science
education. Classification, subject indexing and abstracting &#8211; already
mentioned above &#8211; are such activities. The results of classification
materialises in the form of some code, while indexing in the form of
words and phrases, abstracting means producing texts, thus it is a
writing activity. An important element of the classification, indexing
and abstracting process is reading, obviously closely connected to
literacy and communication.
</p><p>One of the &#8220;meeting points&#8221; of information literacy and communication is critical reading, closely related to critical thinking. As Knott (<a href="#Knott">2005</a>)
explains, many of our writings involve reflection on written texts as
the thinking and research on the given subject has already been done.
</p><p>Critical reading includes (among others) the following:

</p><ul>
<li><a>Determining the purpose of the text and assessing how the central claims are developed; </a>
</li><li><a>Making judgements about the intended audience of the text; </a>
</li><li><a>Distinguishing the different kinds of reasoning in the text; </a>
</li><li><a>Examining the evidence and sources of the writing. </a></li></ul>

<h3>Academic literacy</h3>
<p>If literacy is the ability to read, interpret, and produce texts,
academic literacy is the ability to read, interpret, and produce
information valued in academia according to beliefs about how research
should be done. Academic literacy thus involves the comprehension of
the entire system of thinking, values and information flows of
academia. All this is based on a cultural identity of academia in which
professional language and literature play a key role. In this system
information has a grammatical dimension that information literate
academics must master and students must be taught (<a href="#Elmborg">Elmborg 2006</a>).
One of the principal issues of academic literacy, genre knowledge has been already addressed in the previous chapters.
</p><h3>A subject to cognitive inquiry</h3>
<p>As Ward (<a href="#Ward">2006</a>) underlines, a robust and holistic
conceptualization of information literacy must recognize the interplay
between an external, verifiable reality and an internal, more
subjective reality. </p><p>
</p><p> This is because to work with information successfully requires
a special mentality and skill set to handle situations, tasks,
problems-at-hand (<a href="#Pinto">Pinto 2003</a>). In other words, the
effective use of information also should include a &#8220;critical awareness
of the factors surrounding knowledge production&#8221; (<a href="#Mu">Mutch 1997, 386</a>).
</p>
<p>In addition to this information seeking behaviour, an important constituent of information literacy incorporates complex thought processes (<a href="#Rader">Rader 2002</a>).
</p><p>These are the reasons why information literacy should be made a subject of
psycholinguistics and cognitive science as it stresses the importance
of gaining control over how we interact with information. With this information literacy
sensitizes us to the need of developing a metacognitive approach to
learning. </p><p>Metacognition plays an especially important role in reading.
It is important for native and non-native readers to be aware of the
significant strategies that reading requires. These strategies have to
be integrated into curricula. The reader&#8217;s metacognitive knowledge
about reading includes an awareness of a variety of reading strategies
and reading is influenced by the awareness of reading strategies .
</p><p>As techniques and skills related to information literacy strengthen, so too do
the individual&#8217;s metacognitive processes. Beside the importance of
metacognition and metacognitive processes in it, information literacy consists of
processes that are widely unknown thus require cognitive enquiry. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The definitions of information literacy itself suggest that it is concerned more with
the content than with technologies. There are many pieces of evidence,
a number of approaches by different researchers that information literacy involves at
least reading and writing.
</p><p>Information seeking, an important part of information literacy can be put into the context of writing
and related to communication competencies.
Critical reading is also an important intersection of information literacy and communication as it is academic literacy.
</p><p>Information literacy must recognise the existence of internal
realities, complex thought processes should thus be made a subject of
psycholinguistics and cognitive science. It would be however premature
to draw information literacy consequences of a cognitive enquiry not yet carried out. </p><p>We can nonetheless say that a programme of information literacy that integrates aspects of communication should
be integrated into the curriculum as the Writing Across the Curriculum movement that strived
for a high level involvement of the librarian into writing curricula (see e.g. <a href="#SHER"> Sheridan 1992</a>).

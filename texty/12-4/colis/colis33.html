<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This paper addresses, from a critical perspective, some premises of
our understanding of the library, or, in this paper, "library theory".
My starting point is the notion 'userism', introduced to discussions of
library and information science (or "library, information and
documentation studies" in the sense of <a href="#Suominen07">Suominen 2007</a>) by Suominen (<a href="#Suominen02">2002</a> and <a href="#Suominen04">2004</a>), and employed by  Noruzi (<a href="#Noruzi">2004</a>) to elaborate an understanding of the World Wide Web. Suominen's original formulation is as follows:</p> 

<p><em>There is something particularly convincing in the claim that</em></p>
<ol>
  <li><em> libraries exist for users. Therefore the interests of users must be 
    the basis of library operations.<br />
    Nevertheless, on good grounds one can also take the stand that</em></li>
  <li><em>libraries exist for writers, so the interests of writers should be central 
    in library policies.<br />
    &#8230; Or one might claim that</em></li>
  <li><em>libraries exist for society/the State, and they should serve the interests 
    of society and the State. </em> </li>
</ol>
<p>(<a href="#Suominen02">Suominen 2002</a>). The later formulation (see <a href="#Suominen04">Suominen 2004</a>)
is a bit different to the previous ones in that it uses expressions
like "users' (citizens') interests and 'rights' to receive
information", "society's and culture's interests and 'rights' to have
their members informed" and "[a]uthors' interests and 'rights' to
inform (Suominen 2004, 157). The second part of the argument, for
instance, has to do with the freedom of speech and has major
ideological significance in the societal and ideological background of
public libraries in the "bourgeois public sphere" (see e.g. <a href="#Vestheim">Vestheim 1997</a>). </p> 
<p><a href="#Noruzi">Noruzi (2004)</a> amplifies the criticism to a triple claim 
  that the "Web exists" (i) for users, (ii) for researchers and writers, and (iii) 
  for society. Further, Noruzi quite correctly situates the argument in a wider 
  sphere of social and political discussions, as follows:<em>The growth of 'userism' 
  in recent Web thinking can be understood partly in relation to the prevailing 
  neo-liberalistic view of society. When human beings are reduced to customers, 
  consumers or users, society can be reduced to a market. A critique of 'userism' 
  is thus topical (Suominen, 2002).</em> </p>
<h2>Elaborating the notion of 'userism': user-orientation, object 'userism' and legitimatisation 'userism'</h2>

<p>The notion 'userism' as a critical notion within LIS is connected to
the notion of user-orientation which, in turn, has been a programmatic
concept within the discipline since the latest decennia of the 20th
century. The logic of user-orientation could be expressed briefly in
the following way:</p> 
<ol>
  <li>information systems, including libraries, are for users, and consequently</li>
  <li>we should conduct research on the users in order to better plan and construct 
    the systems.</li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, interest in research on users is already present in classical library research (e.g. <a href="#Berelson">Berelson 1949</a>).
However, there has also been criticism of the user-orientation within
LIS. Quite an explicit instance of this is Ingwersen's (<a href="#Ingwersen">1992</a>)
way to describe the "cognitive paradigm" within information science,
focusing on cognitive structures with the documents and their authors,
the intermediary systems and functions, as well as the users, as
opposed to the user-oriented paradigm which recognizes those structures
with the user only. Similarly, Hjørland and Albrechtsen (<a href="#Hjorland">1995</a>),
with their "domain analytic" view, find domain-specific phenomena not
only on the side of the users but with the documents and the
intermediation as well. Both these instances could be seen as holistic
criticism of the user-oriented tradition. The view they are criticising
could be called <i>object 'userism', a view privilegin the user as the object of research </i>within LIS, information science, or - to a degree - even within documentation studies.</p> <p>However,
with regard to the ideas of the ultimate legitimatisation of the
phenomena under consideration, Ingwersen's as well as Hjørland's and
Albrechtsen's views seem to remain quite userist. We could define this
'userism' as <i>legitimatisation 'userism'</i> because of its
relationship to the ultimate legitimatisation of the practices,
activities, systems etc. that take place and are produced by the
library and information fields. However, the critical remarks to be
made on these two forms of 'userism' are related in terms of their
implications. If we now attempted to define the notion of
legitimatisation 'userism', it could go something like this: <i>Legitimatisation
'userism' is a view which, in an a priori manner, reduces all the
potentially intelligible justifications of an activity, a practice or
an institution, like library and librarianship, to its use and to the
interests of the assumed users - not taking other possible
justifications under consideration as intelligible possibilities.</i> </p> <p>Defined
this way, the following remarks may be made on 'userism'.
Legitimatisation 'userism' works a bit like an ideology, as a kind of
implicit preliminary exclusion of some possible views outside the
meaningful possibilities that even can thought about. It also has some
affinity with the points of departure of methodological individualism,
although it doesn't necessarily imply them. </p> 

<h2>Legitimatisation 'userism' in library theories opened by some major subfields of LIS / information science</h2>

<p>Information retrieval (IR), information seeking (IS) and information
management (IM) could be seen as major subfields of LIS. Starting from
these, we could form the following 'theories of the library', in quite
general statements of what a library essentially is: </p> 
<ol>
  <li> From the perspective of IR the library could be understood as <i>one kind 
    of IR-system</i>.</li>
  <li> From the perspective of IS a library could be seen as <i>one channel for 
    information seeking</i>. </li>
  <li> From the perspective of IM the library could be understood as <i>one instance 
    of information management</i>, and the question is then how to make knowledge, 
    information or data in the library a real resource.</li>
</ol>
<p>As
regards the criticism on 'userism', the problem in conceiving the basic
problems of the library and librarianship in the view of IS is that the
user of the library would be the only intelligibly possible actor whose
interests could legitimate the existence of a library, self-evidently
and without reflection. The possible interests of society, for
instance, would not have any place in this conception. Among other
things, the possible educational dimension of the library could not be
properly conceived of: or at least it would remain marginal and in the
shadows. Of course, we could think that the promotion of information
seeking would be precisely the educational interest and pursuit of
society advanced through libraries. But then, this perhaps would be the
only possible, legitimate educational interest and pursuit of society,
if the theory of the library were reduced to the points of departure of
IS. Nor the interests of those producing information (documentation,
contents etc.), i.e. the interest of the authors, to have their
products as part of the common and public sphere of ideas, knowledge
and meanings, could have a place among the fundamental
legitimatizations of the library either. IR, in turn, could in this
respect be seen directly subsumed to IS. IR systems are (quite
legitimately) seen as created simply to fulfil the information seeking
and retrieval needs of the users; consequently, subsuming the library
to their points of departure would not escape the 'userist' point of
departure. </p> <p>IM, however, is a different case in this respect.
Here, there would be room for the interests and pursuits of the
authorities maintaining, e.g. funding, the library and possibly the
society as well, if the library were understood as an instance of IM.
Fundamentally the idea of making knowledge (data, information) a real
resource is the interest of the organization aiming at some ends, not
primarily of the actual individual user, or an individual employee of
an organization, for instance. The logic of IM, typically connected to
organizations, is the logic of those maintaining the systems, rather
than of those using them. We could think analogically of the public
library system as an instance, or at least as a part of an instance of
IM. The knowledge resources produced could be then of a 'softer kind',
like creativity and social cohesion created by a population's reading
habits, etc. - in short, as elements of what can be called a social
capital.</p> <p>Here, however, another problem arises. It can be
summarized as the problem of conceiving of the difference between
society - especially the so-named <i>societas civilis</i> or bourgeois
society - on the one hand, and the concept of organization on the
other. Within the criticism on 'userism', this can be presented as a
claim that an IM based understanding of the library and librarianship
does not taken into account the interests of the users and especially
not the interests of the producers, e.g. authors but even publishers
with primary and undeniable rights, with reference to the intellectual
freedoms of the members of bourgeois society. Basically different views
or 'voices', in terms of IM, would have their justification as far as
they may be seen as additions to the resource. Thus, their <i>raison d'être</i>
would be conditional while the logic of bourgeois society claims that
the right of expression should be unconditional. This argument is, of
course, dependent on our commitment to the idea of bourgeois society or
<i>societas civilis</i>: but when considering the fundamentals of, say,
the public library, we should at least consider these issues (Cf. e.g..
Vestheim's, <a href="#Vestheim">1997</a>, reference to the Habermasian notion of the bourgeois public sphere in the context of the emergence of the public library). </p> <p>If
conceiving of the library from the perspective of IM, then, unlike IR
and IS, it would be possible and even necessary to take into account
the interests of the maintainers of the libraries and the authorities
funding the libraries, for instance. However, even this view would be
tightly connected to the notion of resource, as in the view of the
library based on the notions of IR and IS. By way of a conclusion, we
can state that these three subfields of LIS, if taken as a basis for a
theory of the library and librarianship, are based on a view of society
and culture that can be characterized as narrowly, even naively,
rationalist. Furthermore, the views of the library derived from them
are, in a certain way, one-dimensional, restricted to the aspects of
exploiting and benefiting from knowledge, information, content etc.
These views of the library could be summarized as views of the <i>library as a resource</i>.</p> 

<h2>Legitimate legitimatisations of the library other than that of the user: via tradition and authority to the political</h2>

<p>In Suominen (<a href="#Suominen04">2004</a>), the fundamental functionality of the library and librarianship is reviewed in the light of Gadamer's (<a href="#Gadamer">1960/1986</a>)
concept of "rehabilitation of tradition and authority". With this
theme, Gadamer can be seen as returning to a pre-Enlightenment era,
questioning some major claims of the modern political thinking: </p><p><em>...we examined the Enlightenment's discreditation of the
concept of "prejudice". What appears to be a limiting prejudice from
the viewpoint of the absolute self-construction of the reason in fact
belongs to historical reality itself. If we want to do justice to man's
finite, historical mode of being, it is necessary to fundamentally
rehabilitate the concept of prejudice and acknowledge the fact that
there are legitimate prejudices.</em> </p> <p></p> <p>(<a href="#Gadamer">Gadamer 1960/1986</a>, 277.)</p> <p>When
Gadamer justifies the whole hermeneutical approach with a reference to
"man's finite, historical mode of being", we could consider that he is
speaking of the human condition that has a longer historical arch than
the modernity that emerged via and since the Enlightenment. Gadamer's
justification for the whole hermeneutical problem is in this way nearly
existential and, consequently, nearly over-historical as far as it
concerns the history of mankind. </p> <p>The library is quite old as a
phenomenon and even as an institution-some thousands of years old. We
could even say that the library is a rather primitive phenomenon, in
accordance with its relative simplicity: collecting and preserving
documents. These aspects in themselves could encourage us to look for
the philosophical basis from Gadamer-type considerations, focusing as
they do on nearly eternal cultural fundamentals.</p> <p>Tontti (<a href="#Tontti">2005</a>,
58), a Finnish hermeneutical philosopher of law, draws the main lines
of the hermeneutical tradition of philosophy in a most illustrative
way, by characterising the Gadamerian thinking as a view of humans
existing since the starting point, as an opposition to the Heideggerian
emphasis of the future and of human existence as existence towards the
future - or actually, with Heidegger, towards the death. With Gadamer,
"man's finite, historical mode of being" especially refers to the 'back
limit' of human existence, the birth, the beginning. We could formulate
his view simply as follows: we all start (are born) in our turn in some
moment of time, and always we start something that is already there.
Here precisely would be the place of the library and librarianship too,
as a representative of tradition and authority (see <a href="#Suominen04">Suominen 2004</a>).
The library, more exactly, the content of a library, the books and
other documentation, quite substantially is what is already there. In
no library has there been books published tomorrow.</p> <p>We can see
Hoel's valid question but in a sense not so obviously the 'right
answer' when he is investigating the essence of LIS in hermeneutical
terms, as symptomatic of the dominant way of thinking within LIS and
information science:</p> <p></p> <p><em>... information passed on by a
library or information system is inevitably a record of knowledge that
is from the past; there is no escape from that. That knowledge has
already become historical long before it is transformed and
disseminated by the system. But does this fact entail that library and
information science (LIS) is by nature historical?</em></p><em> </em><p><em>As far as I can see, it does not. That would be to confuse knowledge about the medium with insight into the message.</em> </p> <p></p> <p>(<a href="#Hoel">Hoel 1992</a>, 70.)</p> <p>The hermeneutics of Hoel, like of many others within LIS (see e.g. <a href="#Capurro">Capurro 1992</a>, <a href="#Cornelius">Cornelius 1996</a> and <a href="#Richardot">Richardot 1996</a>),
seems to have a strong inclination towards understanding the human
condition as being towards the future-even if not quite towards the
death in the Heideggerian spirit, but more like 'towards success',
perhaps-rather than as being since the starting point or beginning. The
latter, being since the beginning, however, could be closer to the
specific fundamental essence of the library as one particular practice
related to information, documentation, knowledge, cultural contents,
etc.</p> <p>Gadamer's emphasis is on history and tradition; and as
regards the essence of the library, I think, this is exactly what
should be pondered. However, within LIS this kind of understanding is
relatively rare. Shera's (<a href="#Shera">1975</a>, 49) emphasis on
the "preservation and transmission of cultural heritage" as the
fundamental and at the same time traditional and most important
function of the library approaches this, together with the conservative
element in Birdsall's (<a href="#Birdsall">1994</a>, 110)  "politics of librarianship". Suominen (<a href="#Suominen04">2004</a>)
draws the Gadamerian theme closer to the library and librarianship with
the notion of the "authority of document", whether formal or
substantial. A reliable edition of, say, Summa Theologica by Thomas
Aquinas can be a rather formal authority in the sense that it can
assure us that Aquinas really has written some particular sentence,
chapter etc. However, for a catholic Neo-Thomist scholar, for instance,
the text of St Thomas, Doctor Angelicus, could be an authority still in
quite another sense, as a substantial authority, too.</p> <p>Essentially,
a view of the library in the light of the Gadamerian theme of the
rehabilitation of tradition and authority would emphasise the essence
of the library as a part of the educational dimensions and functions of
the society and culture. It would connect the library and librarianship
to the genuinely reproductive and, in that sense quite fundamental
educational aspects. To sum up this view, we could characterise it as a
view of the <i>library as a heritage</i>.</p> <p>Yet there remains a
significant issue to be made from the point of view of the
Enlightenment and not least the problematic aspects of the authority in
view of the modern political thinking. On a rather fundamental level,
even with an explicit reference to Gadamer, the problem of tradition
and criticism is expressed by Wellmer, a Frankfurt School scholar, as
follows:</p> <p></p> <p><em>The course of the Enlightenment as an
extension of Western Christian tradition reveals what might be called
its "revolutionary core": the intention to achieve actual freedom in
view of the inherited lack of freedom in practice; the spirit of
criticism in view of the equally inherited legitimations of a lack of
freedom. This tendency of the Enlightenment cannot be separated fro the
political movements of emancipation in modern times; this connection,
however, emphasizes what the Enlightenment knew and hermeneutics
forgets: that the "dialogue" which (according to Gadamer) we "are", is
also a relationship of coercion and, for this very reason, no dialogue
al all.</em> </p> <p></p> <p>(<a href="#Wellmer">Wellmer 1969</a>, 47.)</p> <p>Within LIS, neither these aspects have been very much emphasised. A noteworthy exception must be Harris' (<a href="#Harris">1986</a>)
criticism of what he calls the "American theory of librarianship"
through a conceptual frame built up of the Gramscian notion of hegemony
and Bourdieu's notion of cultural power. Similar to Wellmer's argument,
the conceptual points of departure point exactly to the power
incorporated in, and functioning through, the dialogues, communication,
or discourses. Naturally, there has been some challenging of power in
the literature on the libraries in terms of the somewhat programmatic
views of the need to recognize different voices, as well-the Library
Bill of Rights (see <a href="#ALA">ALA 1948-1980</a>) as a classical and programmatic instance. Even on the more scholarly level one could note, for instance, Tuominen's (<a href="#Tuominen">2000</a>) distinctly constructionist and programmatic argument that the libraries should promote "dialogue", rather than "monologue." </p> <p>Yet,
in the Gadamerian spirit, it is to be noted that neither critical talk
nor discourse can be outside tradition and without some authority-the
authority of criticism, so to speak. Actually, the Gadamerian theme
discussed here would be most significant to understanding criticism,
too. Without the traditions of criticism, there can only be a few
different opinions, rather than true and substantial criticism.</p> <p>In
any case, the theme put forward by Welles does have significance, at
least insofar as we are looking for the legitimatisation of the library
within modern political thinking and the bourgeois society or societas
civilis. This could redirect the search for the scholarly basis for the
library and librarianship, from an emphasis on the notion of resource
within LIS towards the notion of publicity, having a similar
thematisizing position in journalism (see e.g. <a href="#Boerder">Boerder 2005</a>). The <i>library</i>, then, could also be seen <i>as a part and form of publicity</i>,
rather than only and self-evidently as a channel for information
seeking, or as a resource and as a source of information in some other
way defined. </p> <p>If the library and librarianship were understood
in the light of the Gadamerian theme of the rehabilitation of tradition
and authority, taking also into account the aspects of criticism, and
in the light of Suominen's (<a href="#Suominen02">2002</a> and <a href="#Suominen04">2004</a>)
analysis of 'userism' and the notion of legitimatisation 'userism'
introduced here, we could formulate following kind of claims about the
library:</p> 
<ol>
  <li> It is good, even necessary for us to 'listen to' tradition and authority; 
    this, however, would basically still be a 'userist' legitimatisation, having 
    reference to what is 'good for us', yet already recognising the significance 
    of the historical dimension of human existence and culture</li>
  <li> Tradition and authority belong to the cultural and social reality we are 
    living in, which would be, in a sense, a neutral remark of a fact and could 
    lead, for instance, to the previous claim as a conclusion. Yet it could lead 
    us to see the basic responsibility of the library also as the responsibility 
    of that part of social and cultural reality-not only as the responsibility 
    for answering to our needs for information, for instance. This claim could 
    also lead us to consider the legitimate educational interests of society, 
    State, etc., their interests in something to 'be heard'. Further, this claim 
    would emphasise the political aspects of the library and librarianship, due 
    to the power relatedness of traditions, and perhaps also, but not necessarily, 
    the political with emancipatory aspirations.</li>
  <li> Tradition and the authors of it have a say. That is, they have a 'right 
    to be heard', which would have a connection not only to the educational dimensions 
    of the library but to the aspects of criticism and, empathetically, to the 
    possible emancipatory political dimensions of the library, having affinity 
    with the ideals of the freedom of expression as well.</li>
</ol>
<p>With reference especially the
last point comes also the quite concrete rule that requires us to point
out in a scholarly text, via a reference, our use of a previous
writer's idea. This would lead to issues of the sphere of norms and
ownership, which also are quite fundamental social and cultural
functions, despite the legislation proper of copyright being a
relatively recent phenomenon in this regard.</p> <p>Here we could also
open discussion on the amplification of criticism based on the notion
of 'userism' to the WWW by Noruzi. Clearly the WWW is a form of
publicity and dealt with as such in the research on journalism, for
instance. The WWW could also be viewed as heritage, and actually is
dealt with as such by the libraries, for instance by the national
depository libraries. Talking about the maintainer of the WWW might be
somewhat problematic but not impossible. Thus, it seems to me,
Nouruzzi's amplification would have some serious plausibility.</p> 

<h2>Concluding remarks: from a minimalist-phenomenal concept of the
library to understanding of the various possible intelligible
functionalities</h2>

<p>A library theory and concept should provide us with the basis for
understanding the various possible intelligible aspects of the library.
It should enable us to see the different dimensions of the library and
librarianship, various subsections of it, the rationalities of those
subsections etc., as basically and in the first phase equally
intellectually possible conceptions. It should not preliminarily
exclude some of them outside the intelligible options via some too
hastily assumed too concrete premises.</p> <p>To attain the different
dimensions of the library and librarianship, we should perhaps start
from a kind of minimalist-phenomenal concept of the library, examine
the phenomenon as it can be seen with the 'naked eye', and even then,
in the initial phase, maintain the most fundamental features, without
proceeding too quickly to the possible meaningful and intelligible
functionalities of the library. In this sense, perhaps most obviously,
a library is a place where there are books, or more broadly, material
recordings of some contents, or documents. It is worth noting that a
library as a place where there are books or documents does not exclude
for instance digital libraries, if we accept some flexibility with the
notion of place. </p> <p>There have been libraries in the
minimalist-phenomenal sense for thousands of years in various
civilisations. This could open questions concerning the fundamental
societal and cultural functions they may have manifested. This could
naturally lead to spheres of social and cultural philosophy, even
philosophical anthropology. Kauppi (<a href="#Kauppi">1988</a>),
formerly a Finnish librarian, then teacher of librarianship and finally
a professor of philosophy, uses the concept "library anthropology".
This might require conceptual work outside the core areas of LIS, but
some attention to these issues would be necessary if the aim is to
define the library in terms of its social and cultural functions. </p> <p>Figure
1, in a rough and schematic form, illustrates the situation of the
various possible library theories, with regard to the
minimalist-phenomenal concept of a library introduced above. Views of
the library as heritage and publicity, together with the view of the
library as a resource, are based on functionalities, and in that sense
different from the first phenomenal-minimalist concept. However, the
view of library as a resource, if taken as the self-evident, primary
view of the library, would exclude the others. Suominen (<a href="#Suominen04">2004</a>)
argues concisely how a genuine authority and a genuine resource
mutually exclude each other in some respects. Clearly, similar
arguments could be made with regard to views of the library as a form
of publicity and as a resource, on the basis of the discussion above.</p>

  <div align="center"><strong>Figure 1: The library theories emerging through the three major sufields<br />
 of library and information science, and the wide area of library theories</strong> </div>



<p>While I am suggesting here a phenomenal-minimalist way to formulate
the first definition of the library, LIS and information science seem
to define the library in terms of a kind of minimalist and phenomenal
understanding of culture and society. It seems to be based a kind of
prima facie introspection, revealing ourselves as independently-acting
rational subjects and reducing the potentially intelligible
understanding of our social and cultural condition only to this prima
facie impression. </p> <p>The library is a relatively simple and
practical thing, while our social and cultural existence is a most
complicated matter and hard to grasp, partly owing to the fact that
what is at issue is an understanding of the fundamentals of our own
existence. Consequently, while the phenomenal-minimalist first
definition of the library could be plausible-even fertile-the same
procedure in understanding the cultural and social condition of our
being might include the risk of a highly over-simplified, even naïve
result. Further, as we have seen here, it could even lead to a
relatively limited understanding of the library.</p> <p>So far, I have
focused on the aspects opened by the notion of legitimatisation
'userism'. The view of the library that emerges from this criticism
would, however, also have implications on the objects of investigation
to be emphasised. The focus should, insofar as the library and
librarianship are at issue, probably shift towards disciplinary
perspectives such as book history (see e.g. <a href="#Finkelstein">Finkelstein &amp; McCleery 2005</a>), documentation history as a part of documentation studies in Lund's (<a href="#Lund">1999</a>) sense, as the research on the forms of documentation, or bibliography as outlined by McKenzie (<a href="#McKenzie">1986</a>),
comprehending widely the social life of books. If the library were
viewed as a heritage or a form of publicity, clearly the knowledge of
the materials constituting the library in this sense would be a primary
area of the expertise of librarianship and a librarian. Thus the
criticism of legitimatisation 'userism,' as regards our understanding
of the library, could have implications concerning what I here have
called object 'userism', too.</p>

<meta name="dc.description" content="Introduction. Against a background of declining enrolments and closure of schools, information professionals and educators in Australia have expressed concerns about education for information. The aim of this study then is to formally canvass views and thinking about these concerns with stakeholders - academics, educators, library managers and students.
Method. A semi-structured interview process was used for getting the story behind each participant's experience. Questions began with a 'stimulus' quotation from recent literature and were open-ended in nature. A stratified purposive sample of information professionals for whom information management or library and information science is an essential component of their occupation was used. Interviews, conducted during June to August 2006, were tape-recorded and transcribed.
Analysis. Context and meaning in the interviews was explored through content analysis using NVivo™ software. The grounded theory approach to data analysis drew out major themes and concerns of participants. Use of several coders and monitoring for consistency ensured the reliability of classifications. 
Results. Responses mainly from educators and academics are discussed in this paper. A framework of significant changes to the information environment as seen by the information professionals interviewed is presented. Analysis focuses on the impact of changes experienced and on reforms they suggest for the education sector. Four broad themes emerge from the data: changes driven by technological innovations; a confirmation of the basic core knowledge; the need for broadening the scope of education programmes; and relationships with neighboring information fields. Work on the analysis of interviews is ongoing. 
Conclusions. Findings to date indicate that academics and educators think that information management and library and information science education in Australia needs reform. They also point to necessary adjustments to content in order to prepare graduates for expanding career opportunities and roles in business, industry, and non-traditional settings as well as in traditional settings and services." />

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>All professions and disciplines encounter change from within and externally, 
  and to move forward successfully, change and evolution are necessary. Developments 
  in the area of information technology, communication networks, the Internet 
  and the World Wide Web, as well as the digitization of information of all kinds 
  have set the scene for changes in many spheres, and in particular for Australian 
  Information Management  and Library and Information Science. Over 
  the last ten years, university information management or library and information science programmes have experienced erratic or declining 
  numbers of enrolments, closure of some library and information science schools, and changing employment 
  opportunities for graduates. There is a need to re-think or re-conceptualize 
  education for information in a much broader context &#8211; a context encompassing 
  many areas of knowledge and expertise that are relevant to every sector and 
  industry, not only the so-called information-sector.</p>
<p>Tensions and reforms in the Australian higher education sector and their undeniable 
  implications for library and information science education are covered by Hallam (<a href="#hall06">2006</a>) 
  and Harvey (<a href="#har01">2001</a>). Two papers expand the discussion by 
  also providing historical context relating to the problems faced (<a href="#car02">Carroll 
  2002</a>; <a href="#harhi03">Harvey &amp; Higgins 2003</a>). Logan and Hsieh-Yee 
  (<a href="#lhy01">2001</a>) ably described changes in library and information science education in the American 
  context. These contexts are global in reach, and also apply to Australia. </p>
<p>Trends first observed in the US are often replicated in Australia, generally 
  about 5-10 years later. For example, Australia began experiencing the closure 
  of schools in the mid-1990s; Australia also experienced the amalgamation or 
  merger of small specialized schools into larger and more powerful faculties. 
  As in the US, when competition for scarce university funds intensified, Australia 
  struggled to maintain the number of library and information science schools it had in the 1980s with many 
  closing in the late 1990s (<a href="#alia07">ALIA 2007</a>).</p>
<p>As in the US, Australia re-branded information science and library programmes 
  by giving less prominence to library locations or settings for practice. In 
  some instances, moves towards broadening the curricula were made to include 
  more focus on digital and technological content and on business, commercial 
  and non-traditional applications. These trends have been observed among schools 
  that were merged during the late-1990s with larger faculties such as business, 
  commerce or information systems and technology. There has been concern also 
  over core knowledge and competencies in Australia. However, these concerns occupy 
  less prominence in the face of shifts towards educating graduates to work in 
  broader information environments and to consider new career paths in non-traditional 
  agencies and organizations. Other reasons for change particularly in the Australian 
  library and information science context include an aging academic staff profile, and the vexed and unresolved 
  issue of whether to provide undergraduate programmes or to concentrate on post-graduate 
  Masters&#8217; and doctoral programmes.</p>
<p>Australia has yet to debate publicly the issues of convergence and collaboration 
  with related information fields, although Harvey (<a href="#har01">2001</a>) 
  canvassed the idea of a Distributed Learning Network for information management or library and information science in Australia. 
  However, universities here are so strapped for funds that discussions of the 
  educational options possible among converging information disciplines such as 
  represented by the &#8220;ISchool&#8221; phenomenon in the US or Europe, have 
  not been given adequate airplay. Added to anxieties in the Australian context 
  is a view among higher education administration that publication and research 
  outputs of information management or library and information science faculty are less valued or are seen as less research-oriented 
  than those of other disciplines; an especially pertinent point as Australia 
  moves towards the new Research Quality Framework (<a href="#rqf07">2007</a>) 
  with measures that are based on a science-based model of publication performance.</p>
<p>In an attempt to kick-start discussions among stakeholders, the UNSW Information 
  Management Research Group, under the John Metcalfe Foundation programme, created 
  its &#8220;Education4Information&#8217; Project in 2006. Interviews were undertaken 
  during late 2006 in four Australian States with academic and teaching faculty 
  in IM, IS (Information Systems), or library and information science programmes, university administrators, 
  and librarians in various practice and industry environments. The project plans 
  to expand the sample in 2008 to undertake more interviews in the disciplines 
  of IS, KM (Knowledge Management) and IT. For this segment of the Project, staff 
  with computer science, IT or IS training and qualifications in academia, business 
  and industry, and in government organizations would be targeted. In this paper, 
  responses mainly from information management, library and information science and knowledge management educators are described.</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>A semi-structured interview process was adopted for getting the story behind 
  each participant&#8217;s experience. The 14 item schedule allowed for open-ended 
  responses; each item began with a &#8216;stimulus&#8217; quotation from recent 
  literature. Interviews, lasting approximately 45 
  minutes each, were taped and subsequently transcribed.</p>
<p>A non-random stratified interview sample of &#8216;experts&#8217; for whom 
  information management or library and information science is an essential component of their occupation (N=22) was drawn from four 
  Australian states on the eastern seaboard (see Appendix 1). General career or 
  occupational designations are used when excerpts from interviews are quoted 
  in order to preserve respondents&#8217; anonymity. </p>
<p>The conceptual approach taken is based on grounded 
  theory using qualitative content analysis (<a href="#glastr76">Glaser &amp; 
  Strauss 1976</a>; <a href="#stco98">Strauss &amp; Corbin 1998</a>).  
  Content analysis method is used because of its power in exploring context, meaning 
  and semantic relationships, from the transcripts of interviews&nbsp; (<a href="#berg06">Berg 
  2006</a>). The method provides for careful, detailed and systematic examination 
  of communications to identify patterns, themes, biases, and meanings.  
  The NVivo&#8482; software package allowed us to categorize the content, 
  and to identify trends, as well as similarities and differences of opinion. 
  Categorization followed an iterative process in which there was referral back 
  to the transcripts of interviews for verification of context. The reliability 
  of the coding was ensured by using several independent coders, and by monitoring 
  and comparing coding to achieve consistency and stability of concepts. Through 
  this process, the major themes and concerns of participants emerged from the 
  data and not from a preconceived subject classification. </p>
<p>This paper presents 
  data related to technology use and associated educational reforms. The framework 
  presented in Figure 1 emerged from the data (using grounded theory), rather 
  than from prior notions or theories about 
  educational reform or agendas. 
  The framework is based on the frequency of comment made by respondents. 
  It shows that triggers for change arise 
  from new uses of technology and communication networks. It also shows that facilitators 
  for reform include society&#8217;s expectations about education for careers 
  and jobs. Workplace requirements and expectations 
  as triggers and facilitators of change, however, are the subject of another 
  paper, and are not discussed here.</p>
<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p> 
  This paper reports on what respondents expressed as the important triggers, 
  facilitators and barriers in the following inter-connected areas. These are 
  listed below. The data are derived from responses to 9 questions (64%) from 
  16 participants (76%) (See Appendices 1 and 2).</p>
<ul>
  <li> Information technology and usage</li>
  <li> Core knowledge for information management or library and information science </li>
  <li> Educational reforms for information disciplines</li>
  <li> Convergence and multi-disciplinary alliances. </li>
</ul>

  <strong>Figure 1: Conceptual 
  Framework of Triggers of Change</strong></div>
  
<h3>Information technology and usage</h3>
<p> 
  Our respondents were asked to identify the major drivers of change in their 
  areas of work in libraries or information services, as educators, and as administrators 
  in libraries or educational institutions. Whatever their career status, interviewees 
  identified similar drivers or triggers of change, and emphasized positive aspects 
  of change, such as greater access to information resources, speed of access, 
  and new ways of connecting to people.</p>
<p> 
  Technological change pertinent to the world of information service and delivery 
  was a focus. Respondents mentioned changes brought about by ICTs within the 
  profession and in business and that computers and other information and communication 
  technologies have infiltrated into the everyday life of many people. </p>
<p> 
  There was universal acknowledgement that the Internet, the Web, and information 
  and communication technologies (ICTs) have acted as change agents in many fields 
  and professions, and particularly for the information professions. Respondents 
  identified the nature and extent of impacts they experienced from these areas, 
  and provided views of ways to respond to such change. The themes and topics 
  raised are illustrated by verbatim quotes to indicate varying levels of meaning 
  and nuance, and differences in their experience. </p>
<p> 
  Interviewees frequently talked about the impact of the Internet and the networking 
  of information as having changed the way people do their work. Some describe 
  how these triggers also changed their own work behaviour and practice. Some older 
  respondents are critical of student reliance on the Internet rather than using 
  the library, but as one early-career librarian points out:</p>
  
<blockquote> 
What is different now 
    relates to the kind of information people want &#8211; now they prefer online 
    and interactive services &#8211; the current generation is pro interactive 
    information. 
</blockquote>
<p> 
  The situation is bluntly stated by a senior administrator in an academic library: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
The Internet is used 
    and that&#8217;s that &#8230; If we don&#8217;t come to grips with the use 
    of the Internet in libraries and elsewhere, we&#8217;re lost to the users.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  However, one educator accepts the reality of users preferring to search for 
  information on the Web:</p>
<blockquote> 
Google is not the end 
    of libraries. On the contrary, Google is the friend of libraries because it 
    has made people more conscious of accessing information and also more conscious 
    of the rubbish they find &#8211; so the role of the trained intermediary is 
    becoming more important.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Respondents also acknowledge that the Internet changed their modes of working 
  dramatically. One young academic in a teaching department says:</p>
<blockquote> 
Access to the Internet 
    has changed the teaching environment and the way one has to teach now. It 
    changes the way you have to approach teaching. Many of the undergraduates 
    feel they &#8216;know it all&#8217; and it is difficult to get them to understand 
    [that] there is something worthwhile for them to learn about how to search 
    and strategize searching better. This is challenging.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Libraries were very early adopters of computers with hardware and software solutions 
  to a range of crucial activities, such as building online catalogues and sharing 
  cataloguing through networked services. Online database use, particularly for 
  bibliographic purposes and abstracting services, has a long history. However, 
  despite long usage of computers in library settings, a number of interviewees 
  mention the difficulties that mature-age career-changers still encounter in 
  learning IT and adapting to the ubiquitous use of computers in the workplace. 
  These career-changers are being taught alongside younger students many of whom 
  arrive with well developed computer skills. This means that library and information science and information management programmes 
  are forced teach IT at introductory levels that leave students with good IT 
  backgrounds dissatisfied. </p>
<p> 
  A senior educator deplores the fact that even in 2006 <i>'</i>…<i>we still have 
  to teach a great deal of IT because skills of students in this area are lacking.&#8221;</i> 
  Looking further ahead, this educator suggests that:&nbsp; <i>'</i>… <i>because 
  IT changes often and is so dynamic, perhaps we will always have to teach a certain 
  amount of IT&#8221;</i>. Younger interviewees propose that it should be assumed 
  that students &#8220;&#8230;<i>come with the basic suite of online and ICT skills. 
  </i>One strongly puts the view that<i>: &#8220;ICT is &#8230;not part of the 
  [library and information science] course at all.&#8221;</i></p>
<p> 
  These findings accord with the &#8220;significant confusion over what every 
  librarian should understand about IT&#8221; noted by Xu &amp; Chen (<a href="#xuch01">2001</a>: 
 319).</p>
<p> 
  A number of interviewees speak of changes to their thinking, ways of working, 
  and even career paths, occasioned by new technologies.</p>
<blockquote> 
The Internet and the 
    rise of communication networks, both these factors, changed the direction 
    of my career significantly. &#8230;This has occupied the last 15 years of 
    my life.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Over the course of her career, another relates that: <i>'</i>… <i>IT changed 
  how we did everything &#8211; from organization workflows that were realigned 
  by the computer. Instead of being paper-based, we got to do things differently 
  and more quickly&#8221;.</i></p>
<p> 
  A senior library administrator acknowledges that:</p>
<blockquote> 
Computers changed the 
    nature of my work completely &#8211; so much of communicating is now done 
    via the computer &#8211; communication with staff, stakeholders, suppliers 
    &#8230; everything. &#8230; work is addressed differently in computers.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Younger interviewees suggest that the profession needs better understanding 
  of new technological developments:</p>
<blockquote> 
… and what they can 
    do within the profession – how does it all work, for example, XML, digital 
    library technology, electronic records management, content management – [the 
    profession] needs to go deeper into these things.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  The online environment with universal use 
  of computers and other electronic devices has wrought many changes in service 
  levels and access to information resources. Respondents see the traditional 
  focus of libraries shifting away from outright ownership of resources (collection 
  development) to provision of resources made accessible via electronic searching 
  tools and shared resources via online subscriptions or leasing arrangements. 
  That delivery methods have changed is hardly challenged, with frequent references 
  to the use of mobile devices such as, cell phones or personal digital assistants, the Web, and channels other than just looking for a book or a journal 
  article in a library. One mid-career librarian says expectations of users in 
  relation to libraries are different than they were in the past, and she questions 
  cogently: <i>'What does this mean for libraries when there are so many ways 
  of using information?'</i> &nbsp;In part response to her own rhetorical question, 
  she suggests that libraries might best focus on service and delivery by thinking 
  laterally and being flexible and responsive. Advocates of looking at ICTs as 
  vehicles for the delivery of information to clients are not only the younger 
  librarians. One senior manager states:</p>
<blockquote> 
It is important to understand 
    that there are different channels for delivering information that can be shared 
    &#8211; the mobile phone, for example, may replace the PC. Information can 
    be delivered or brought to you on your mobile phone &#8211; being aware that 
    there is more than just the Web &#8211; there&#8217;s the IPod etc.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Many interviewees, in recognizing the power of electronic information, express 
  the view that students need to be capable in ICT to deal with digital content.<b> 
  </b>One senior manager in the information resources sector avers that: </p>
<blockquote> 
The digital world is 
    a major shift, including the framework of what is now possible, and how to 
    interact in the Web world. This shift is reflected in the generational gap 
    between the paper generation and the digital one.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  She highlights some of the resultant issues:</p>
<blockquote> 
The issue of digital 
    libraries is clearly a challenge &#8211; libraries are becoming places for 
    access to digital documents, but there are huge problems to deal with here 
    such as, rights of access to the materials, preservation, use (such as who 
    gets to use the files or documents) issues about authorization and custody 
    rather than possession; the crux is not the &#8216;object&#8217;, but how 
    &#8216;objects&#8217; are managed.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  The increased growth and access to digital information is highlighted by a senior 
  academic:</p>
<blockquote> 
… part of the access is the availability to the increasing networked information, 
    not just the type of information, but the places to go to get that information 
    - obviously underpinned by the Internet.
</blockquote>
<h3>Core knowledge for information management or library and information science</h3>
<p> 
  Respondents have very clear notions of what the core knowledge claims of the 
  information management or library and information science profession are. Most agree on those areas of knowledge which remain our 
  unique domain and stress the need to retain and even strengthen these areas. 
  Many respondents feel quite strongly that not only is information management or library and information science core knowledge 
  distinct from that of other fields but that it is becoming increasingly valuable 
  for other information fields, particularly the information systems field, and 
  for new &#8216;digital world&#8217; issues. When asked about what distinguishes 
  information management or library and information science professionals, this response from a library administrator seems to sum 
  it up:</p>
<blockquote> 
It is &#8230; around information evaluation, organization, management and 
    access &#8211; and the theoretical framework around all that &#8211; in this 
    we run rings around other professionals in our grounding and knowledge about 
    theory and the basics, such as indexing, representation, and so on. 
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Another academic who has been in the education 
  field for many years states his view that: </p>
<blockquote> 
…the unique body of knowledge is around how people interact with information; it draws on how information is organized, how people get access to information to do the things they need to do. This is a newer focus on information behaviour. The principles still apply around organization of information.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Many see the core set of knowledge as reasonably coherent across the classic 
  information fields of librarianship, archives, recordkeeping, or museum curatorship. 
  Among the core skills and knowledge respondents point out cataloguing, classification 
  in its many forms (now often labeled as ontology or taxonomy) and aspects of 
  the curatorial roles of selection and preservation of all information records. 
  As one educator emphasizes:</p>
  
<blockquote> 
information management or library and information science content is so important because the need to manage information is ubiquitous and important &#8211; everywhere, not just in libraries.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  At the same time as asserting the value of these skills, this educator also 
  believes that we need &nbsp;<i>'… a wholesale re-direction of thinking about 
  the ways in which we represent documents, manuscripts and records, including 
  issues relating to classification, cataloguing, descriptions, and metadata</i>.&#8221; 
</p>
<p> 
  Other content added to the traditional subjects includes understanding of the 
  social implications of information, good retrieval skills, problem solving ability, 
  and customer service. A recently graduated librarian believes that learning 
  about the Web should be a core part of our profession and thinks that [librarians] 
  should not only know the tool well but be able offer something better than other 
  professions. </p>
<p> 
  More than half of all respondents emphasize the importance of teaching basic 
  concepts relating to the nature of information. As one mid-career teaching academic 
  describes it:</p>
<blockquote> 
The most important components 
    of the core knowledge set is an understanding of information itself, its properties, 
    its characteristics, its contexts, and our relationship to information and 
    our capacity to do all that we need to do to document, describe and share 
    information.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  This view is echoed by educators who think it vital to inculcate in students</p>
<blockquote> 
… an understanding of 
    the way information works, in terms of being a communication process at all 
    kinds of levels, organizational, individual, etc. … recognition of information 
    as a substance, a product in its own right shaped by social forces and society.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Engaged in both information science and systems teaching, this educator believes 
  that the reference literature of information management or library and information science is strong. In discussing the scope and 
  relevance of courses for today&#8217;s needs, he says:</p>
<blockquote> 
…it’s a case of 'What is old is new again' – some of the classic things taught as integral parts of library and information science are more important and relevant than ever. For example, document management and all the components of that right through from description of information items, to the subjective knowledge of the documentalist describing the information, and the value-adding they [professional documentalists] bring to that process. Another area is the classic skills of reference service. Some of these things have slipped to the wayside in Australia as we moved into an information systems context. These things are relevant and … there is room for them in courses as part of broad business programmes.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Communicating with clients is suggested as a core skill for information management or library and information science professionals. 
  As one respondent expresses it: <i>'… interaction with clients is critical – 
  this is the difference between the 'I' world and the 'IT' world.'</i> </p>
<p> 
  A number of respondents recommend the introduction of a course on information 
  behaviour as a general subject for all information professions or specialties. 
  One respondent puts it succinctly: <i>'The main game is to get through to students 
  that the information itself is what matters.'</i> </p>
<p> 
  Having an understanding about how different people approach information, and 
  learning how to work through people&#8217;s needs, are fundamental skills, which 
  many respondents think essential if information professionals are to meet clients&#8217; 
  demands. One library manager encapsulates this idea: <i>&nbsp;</i></p>
<blockquote> 
… [professionals] need to know how to access all kinds of databases, know 
    where the information is, look at all channels, contexts.
</blockquote>
<h3>Educational reforms for information disciplines</h3>
<p> 
  Different views and emphases emerge 
  from the data on how to manage change within 
  the educational curriculum (see in 
  Figure 2). Barriers to reform seen 
  by interviewees arise partly from the structure of the university faculty system, 
  economically sustainable enrolments, and length of programmes. Another arises 
  from the labels of librarianship and library science or studies which 
  no longer seem to fit student expectations or many key employment opportunities 
  for graduates. One could say that the labelling issue is somewhat of a hot topic. 
  One senior manager has this to say:</p>
<blockquote> 
The real challenge in 
    the profession is how to differentiate ourselves to be unique in the way you 
    manage, not always doing things the way we used to do &#8230; Innovation is 
    critical in an organisation. It 
    is not necessarily an efficiency gain, but a value seen in differentiation.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Another interviewee thinks 
  that: </p>
<blockquote> 
… the lines are very 
    much blurred nowadays … information organizations [like libraries or museums] 
    need to be able to respond in a much broader way about markets and where they 
    position themselves.
</blockquote>

  and Program Reforms" /></div>
  <div align="center"><strong>Figure 2: Content and programme reforms</strong></div>
  
<p> 
  An early-career level librarian emphasizes a need to look at structural change, 
  particularly the identity and role of the library, and of professionals working 
  in libraries. He regrets that <i>'a lot of people are still grounded by what 
  or how it was done in the past'</i> and who seem unwilling to change their roles 
  or that of the library. He believes the profession needs: <i>'… to develop new 
  ways of present ourselves and the library differently'</i>. This point about 
  presenting the profession differently is echoed by a senior consultant in the 
  field:</p>
  
<blockquote> 
We need to reconceptualize 
    what information is &#8211; this is a contested area and it needs to be re-thought 
    because information is conceptualized differently among different professionals/industry/business/IT 
    &#8211; so there is a need for a mutual understanding about what information 
    is. Issues here include: currency, duplication, space. 
</blockquote>
<p> 
  In the course of the interview, respondents 
  were asked to suggest reforms or ways of changing the curriculum to improve 
  the programmes currently offered in Australia. The overall impression or sense 
  is that reform and revision of educational programmes are essential in order to 
  accommodate the inevitable changes brought by 
  ICTs and digitalization. Many expressed 
  the view that attention to changes in the field and the marketplace needs 
  to be ongoing. </p>
<p> 
  Respondents are critical of course structures 
  and content when asked to specify changes or alternatives to programmes. This 
  interviewee comments on insufficient work-related preparation: </p>
<blockquote> 
Would have been better 
    to have a practical component and an industry component in the course. The 
    programme did not prepare me for what happened when I took my first job.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  One respondent complains about the depth of intellectual content:</p>
<blockquote> 
The current offerings in library and information science or information management in Australia attempt to cover everything &#8211; but not at a deep enough level. 
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Others believe that depth and content are limited by the duration of courses:</p>
  
<blockquote> 
...a one-to-one-and-a-half-year programme can only give an introduction &#8211; too superficial really.&nbsp; Not in any way, shape, or form can it properly deliver the content.
</blockquote>

<p> 
  In reflecting on possible reforms, some think that information management or library and information science could be given:</p>
<blockquote> 
… a great deal more 
    prominence at government level, even be mandated as part of curriculum. Not 
    sure how it is to be done.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  In reflecting on the scope of current courses 
  and their relevance for today&#8217;s needs, respondents nominate types of reforms 
  to education that might usefully be pursued. This line of questioning produced 
  a range of views which are highlighted below.</p>
<p> 
  Arising from the pervasive use of the Internet 
  and WWW resources, several interviewees voice concern with teaching a form of 
  information literacy that is focussed on how best to use the host of electronic 
  resources now available. One respondent with long years of experience in libraries 
  suggests information literacy is not only important for the general population, 
  but that:</p>
<blockquote> 
… the development of information literacy is vital for success in operating in economic contexts.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Again we hear the concern for students to acquire:</p>
<blockquote> 
… a deep understanding 
    of what the Web means in terms of information, in terms of search engines 
    and how they work, of how to optimize them and about issues around the deep 
    Web area, that is, what’s there and isn’t there.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Another senior person in education says that, if she were in charge of universities: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
… everyone would take 
    a one-day workshop or some other concentrated course on using the Interenet 
    and the whole Web with a view to instilling some ideas about quality of pages/sites. 
    To disabuse them that search engines show all of the 1000s of Web pages to 
    them. Also to show them that many sites have questionable authority – so [we] 
    need to teach students to use their critical faculties to identify quality 
    resources on Web.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Ideas expressed by the younger interviewees stress that the current generation 
  of users prefer online and interactive information: <i>'they don’t want to read 
  long passages of stuff, in their everyday lives; they go more for online materials'.</i> 
  In line with this view is the suggestion from a senior educator that &#8216;digital 
  content&#8217; should be taught as a course <i>'through the life cycle of information 
  creation, retrieval, storing, controlling, disposing, and so on</i>'. Emphasizing 
  this point, she believes a new digital libraries course should be:</p>
<blockquote> 
… a capstone subject 
    that is basic for all.&nbsp; This area is exciting, fundamental and requires 
    all the former traditional Information Management skills, such as classification 
    or taxonomy, and extends the student with digital information sources, ideas 
    about audience needs, design of Web sites and so on.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Bawden <em>et al&#8217;</em>s study (<a href="#bvz04">2004</a>) on education and training 
  in Slovenia and the UK indicated that existing courses were being adapted or 
  re-designed rather than creating new courses labelled <em>digital library</em>. </p>
<p> 
  The many issues around digitized information concern our interviewees. All agree 
  that the digital world is a major shift and most are concerned about issues 
  of copyright, intellectual property, concepts of authenticity, integrity, plagiarism, 
  ethical behaviour, and protection of records. So great are the concerns relating 
  to the digitization of information that one researcher and manager believes 
  that: </p>
<blockquote> 
… whole slews of things need to be re-thought; we need to go back to the 
    conceptual building blocks to consider the ways and the why we do things.
</blockquote>
<h3>Convergence and multi-disciplinary alliances</h3>
<p> 
  The interview schedule raised the issue 
  of the multiplicity of related information fields and courses preparing graduates 
  for information professions. Responses to these issues provide the evidence 
  for developing another NVivo model (see Figure 3) which shows administrative 
  structures and attributes necessary for change as well as the main themes respondents 
  identified as ripe for discussion &#8213; divergence and separation of disciplines 
  and fields, commonalities among them, and the vexed issue of competition among 
  the fields themselves and universities within the Australian higher education 
  sector. Respondents also commented on their views about convergence and collaboration 
  among the spectrum of information disciplines and professions. Other studies 
  have concluded that collaborative partnerships in teaching are useful (see <a href="#bucetal02">Buchanan 
 <em> et al.</em> 2002</a> re information literacy courses). The possibility of designing 
  a single stream as a beginning course from which graduates could continue into 
  specialist courses in a range of fields was canvassed. All these issues were 
  given serious consideration. Despite not having time to give fully-considered 
  responses, and although some expressed reservations, most comments were not 
  completely dismissive of notions of collaboration, cooperation or convergence.</p>
<p> 
  One respondent suggests 
  that:</p>
<blockquote> 
…one would need to deconstruct what is in the core of the different information disciplines to 
    get any idea of a single course – I would leave Computer Sciences out because 
    it is about bits and boxes – that’s not about information management, whereas 
    information management is on about the stuff in the box and how it behaves.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  However, one respondent explodes 
  vehemently when asked to consider convergence among information-related programmes. 
  </p>
<blockquote> 
I have no patience with 
    divergence &#8211; there is a commonality among information fields that is 
    vital and important. They are all essentially the same field with differences 
    in manifestation; they are within the progressional range of information work.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  He is of course talking about similarities and convergence, even emergence. 
  Another respondent expresses it differently:</p>
<blockquote> 
It seems to me to be more like emergence.&nbsp; We are almost a meta-discipline 
    really; we can fit any academic and social context. I&#8217;d like to see 
    less convergence and more emergence &#8211; more sharing with other disciplines, 
    but it is not necessary to blend with other fields administratively.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  However, the reality in Australian universities is that a major barrier to bringing 
  the information fields closer is the faculty administrative system, which divides 
  information-related courses. Other impediments are academics clinging to course 
  identities and professionals to specific professional spheres. One interviewee 
  thinks the lack of convergence is not related to the subject domain:</p>
<blockquote> 
I&#8217;d say that mainly 
    the cause [of non-convergence] would 
    be due to the incompatibility of the people running the courses &#8211; because 
    I know that there are informatics faculties in other universities, and that 
    they work well.&nbsp; Yes, it&#8217;s possible to combine them [information 
    courses] together; it&#8217;s not only possible, it&#8217;s happening, and 
    it works in other universities.
</blockquote>	
  <div align="center"> <img border="0" src="colise05fig3.jpg" width="577" height="596" alt="Divergence, 
  Commonality and Competition"/></div>

<div align="center"><br><strong>Figure 3: Divergence, commonality and competition</strong></div>

<p>In terms of running a single stream, course or programme for all information students, 
  a senior academic administrator positively identifies medicine as a model, with 
  its educational programme feeding into various medical colleges and specialties, 
  such as, pediatrics, obstetrics, or surgery. He points out that each of these 
  specialisms belongs in the field of medicine, yet they all commence by learning 
  a common core of knowledge. </p>
<p> 
  The survey results show a lively debate about how to accommodate specialization 
  within current programmes, that is, on specific areas of academic or occupational 
  interest. A recurring barrier is the inability to provide for specializations 
  within the course structure because money is tight and so many programmes in Australia 
  are too small (in terms of staff numbers and student enrolments) to mount specialist 
  courses, or even to offer much in the way of electives. In this context, we 
  note efforts to introduce evidence-based librarianship in the information management curriculum 
  at Queensland University of Technology (<a href="#paha06">Partridge &amp; Hallam 
  2006</a>).</p>
<p> 
  The schedule probed to ascertain whether recognition of specific content from 
  neighboring fields could be accepted as legitimate course credits in information management or library and information science 
  programmes. A key barrier here is the uncertainty of getting approval from academic 
  boards. Some spoke about encouraging students to explore their interests, while 
  recognizing that students need guidance so that what they study is useful to 
  them. A practicing librarian rails at strictures against students taking subjects 
  outside the confines of information management or library and information science programmes, saying that it is: </p>
<blockquote> 
… critical to let students 
    undertake courses for credit outside their programme, if they are approved – 
    it is part of the work to remain flexible and lateral thinking, bringing other 
    kinds of thinking into librarianship.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Pie-in-the sky according to another.</p>
<blockquote> 
Perhaps one could train 
    undergraduates to learn information (structures and behaviour) and related 
    philosophy, how to think, and then have them come back at postgraduate level 
    to learn the management side of things, move to next level&nbsp; &#8230; that 
    would be lovely, but it just won&#8217;t happen that way.
</blockquote>
<p> 
  Less defeatist, but recognizing the reality of university governance at the 
  moment, an experienced educator offers this comment:</p>
<blockquote> 
I see potentially where 
    areas are not actually competing but are increasingly addressing things we 
    consider as in the domain of information management. All of them (information 
    fields) are close for different reasons &#8211; and sometimes we use them 
    as reference disciplines &#8211; and at other times, some disciplines use 
    us as a reference discipline, perhaps not as much as they could. I see a greater 
    need for more interdisciplinary engagement and I don&#8217;t necessarily think 
    that we will see good examples of that while universities create this internal 
    competition around domains. 
</blockquote>
<h2>Discussion of results</h2>
<p> 
  This study exploring the current situation in education for information in Australia 
  is one of the few to explore impacts of information technology and digitized information on academia 
  and the information management or library and information science professions. Analysis to date shows four broad themes emerging 
  as responses to educational reform.  The major themes 
  identified are impacts brought about by digitization of information, new communication 
  technologies and electronic/online services, all of which demand reforms to 
  teaching, education curricula and programmes, and training of graduates for professional 
  careers and employment. Many sub-themes are identified under these dimensions. 
</p>
<p> 
  The interviews have provided a rich source of data for analysis on a number 
  of critical educational issues in Australia. The basic conceptual framework 
  which emerges from the data highlights the important 
  triggers, facilitators, and barriers to educational change. The findings 
  show support for the relevance of traditional subjects of information management or library and information science and 
  expansion of core knowledge into behavioural aspects of information use, for 
  the need for specializations or electives, for a stronger focus on digital libraries 
  and issues in digitization, such as IP, copyright, integrity and authentication 
  of information.</p>
<p> 
  Our analysis to date reveals that respondents have many ideas about the necessity 
  for change; however, they did not clearly enunciate pathways to achieve desired 
  and useful reforms. Indeed, the data reveals respondents express great variation 
  and even uncertainty about the type and nature of the reforms needed. Some reforms 
  suggested appear to be tinkering at the edges. All respondents expressed a desire 
  for better communication and cooperation among all the stakeholders in the information 
  disciplines. This is an area which is compromised by the competitive nature 
  of current faculty and administrative structures within Australia&#8217;s university 
  sector. Analysis indicates that information management or library and information science (e.g. library studies, information science, 
  knowledge management, archives, &amp; records management) continue to be rather 
  isolated from the broader information domain as a whole leading us to conclude 
  that attention needs to be paid to the resolution of the relationship between 
  cognate areas relating to information, particularly given recent programme closures 
  in Australia. Subsequent analysis will explore respondents&#8217; views about 
  the lack of electives within disciplinary programmes for information management or library and information science and the need for 
  more practicum within programmes. The data also show current programmes are unable 
  to provide students with specializations across current faculty structures.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p> 
  The rigorous interview methodology and the in-depth data generated are strengths 
  of this study. The purposive sample was able to elicit views about education 
  for information from respondents with diverse backgrounds and experience. The 
  schedule enabled participants to respond freely to the issues raised without 
  restriction. Furthermore, respondents were encouraged to reflect on their own 
  experiences, thus enhancing the validity of their responses. These factors ensured 
  that no issue coded in the content analysis was given more prominence than another. 
</p>
<p> 
  Despite the small sample size, which prevents generalization of the results, 
  the study provides plenty of grist for a full discussion or debate of the issues 
  among information professionals and educators. The difficulties encountered 
  in these interviews, such as different professionals not talking the same language, 
  need to be addressed in discussions among educators about curricula and programmes. 
</p>
<p> 
  The findings indicate that in Australia there is an expressed need for information management or library and information science 
  curricula reform and revision. Interviewees agreed on the necessity of a rational 
  adjustment of educational programmes and open discussion among all participants 
  within the broad information domain. All concurred that many issues have not 
  been fully acknowledged or addressed. Analysis of the data is ongoing.</p>
<p> 
  Future research to gather more data from respondents in neighboring disciplines 
  is required in order to generalize results across the broad domain of information 
  professions and to take account of the fast changing environment. Our research 
  did not focus on conceptual frameworks for restructuring, although some respondents 
  made indirect references to this issue. However, any reform remains to be resolved 
  by committed stakeholders within the education system. In the next phase of 
  the project, we intend to canvass views of educators about how they see these 
  urgent concerns of revision and reform of information curricula being addressed.</p>

  <b>Q1</b> I&#8217;d like to open the interview by asking you to reflect on three 
  factors of change that you think are important and which have impacted on your 
  professional career, teaching, practice or working life. What are they, and 
  how has each affected the way you now do things?</p>
<p> 
  <b>Q2</b>: Reflecting on your own training and education and your preparedness 
  for the various roles and positions you have had in your career, would you talk 
  a little about the type of education you received and comment on its applicability 
  and adequacy for today&#8217;s students?</p>
<p> 
  <i>Prompts: </i>How do you view current library and information science education programmes? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Are there any changes or alternatives you would like to see in place of the 
  current array of courses or programmes for education for information?&nbsp;</p>
<p> 
  <b>Q3</b> Tapping into your experience as an educator/manager who has been concerned 
  with information service and delivery: </p>
<p> 
  What are your views about the scope of current courses, programmes or subjects 
  in relation to their relevance for today&#8217;s needs?</p>
<p> 
  <b>Q4</b> Given that information is a primary driver in the economic order of 
  the 21<sup>st</sup> century:</p>
<p> 
  What do you think is important in educating graduates for work in the new information 
  economy?</p>
<p> 
  <i>Prompts: </i>What are your thoughts about any educational reforms that might 
  enable new career paths to be developed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  Could you expand on the sorts of reforms that might be pursued?</p>
<p> 
  <b>Q6</b> Professions have a unique &#8220;body of knowledge&#8217; that must 
  be acquired by those wanting to work in the profession. In your view, is this 
  the case for information education?</p>
<p> 
  <i>Prompts: </i>Could you briefly outline what you think are the most important 
  components of learning needed for the information professional?</p>
<p> 
  <b>Q7</b> A number of disciplines or fields seem to be relevant to LIS education 
  [example prompts: information systems, business management, knowledge management, 
  record keeping, archives management, organizational behaviour]. Do you believe 
  it is possible to outline a single course or programme of education for information?</p>
<p> 
  <i>Prompts: </i>If not, why is it not possible? Could you expand on your views? 
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  To what extent do you believe there is convergence among some of the information-related 
  fields? Which ones?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  To what extent should students in library and information science programmes be permitted to gain credit from 
  courses/subjects in related disciplines as part of a library or information science degree program? For 
  example, in information systems or business management?</p>
<p> 
  <b>Q9</b> Given the ubiquitous nature of computer and information technology 
  in every arena of work, how important is having staff with information technology 
  expertise as well as library and information science training?</p>
<p> 
  <i>Prompts: </i>To what extent should information technology be taught as part 
  of an information education programme? Could you expand on specific aspects of 
  IT content here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  How important would you say is acquiring knowledge and skill in information 
  systems and management?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  How important is training in the area of communications technology? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  How important is it to have training in technical aspects of information retrieval, 
  automatic indexing and metadata applications? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  What topics or how much, would be relevant or useful for information/LIS students 
  to learn?</p>
<p> 
  <b>Q10</b> The Internet has made significant changes to the way information 
  is provided. Is there a need for specific courses on using the Internet for 
  information delivery in LIS educational programmes?</p>
<p> 
  <i>Prompts: </i>In your view, is it important for information/LIS students to 
  learn Web page design, information editing and compilation, or Web publishing 
  skills?</p>
<p> 
  <b>Q14</b> Steven Schwartz, Vice-Chancellor of Macquarie University has said 
  that graduates are ill served by a narrow focus on the utilitarian, and business 
  and employers by the notion that universities exist mainly to confer economic 
  benefits. Universities are not in the business solely of turning graduates ready-made 
  for business or specific jobs; rather they are about educating students for 
  a lifetime of learning and self-fulfilment.</p>
<p> 
  Would you care to comment on this viewpoint in light of education for information 
  management?</p>

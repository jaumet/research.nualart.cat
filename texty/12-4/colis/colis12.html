<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>There are probably few, if any, technological innovations relating
to information and communication technologies (ICTs), from the
telephone to the e-book, that have not found their way to libraries.
Making sense of technological innovations and adapting them effectively
into the library environment are seen as the two most important roles
for librarians at the start of the 21st century (<a href="#martell03">Martell,
2003</a>). Technological innovations are introduced to the library with
the intention of providing better library service and increasing
efficiency of library work (<a href="#rubin04">Rubin, 2004</a>). The
library profession attracts individuals of varying ages, varying
degrees of experience, and a range of technological capabilities, all
of which influence the way they perceive new information and
communication technologies. It is the role of librarians to introduce
new technologies to library users, instruct in their use, and help
patrons recognize meaningful ways to benefit from ICTs. Therefore,
understanding the attitude of librarians toward ICTs, and the factors
that contribute to ICTs' perceived innovativeness, is helpful in
planning, introducing, and incorporating ICTs successfully into the
library.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study is to identify general characteristics and
patterns that exist with regard to the innovativeness of librarians as
it relates to the adoption of ICTs. Specifically, the study addresses
the following questions: How innovative are librarians in relation to
their peers in the adoption of information and communication
technologies? Do demographic variables affect librarian innovativeness?
What implications might the innovativeness of librarians have on the
diffusion of innovations within libraries?</p>
<p>This type of user-centeredness has been a focus of research in
library and information science for quite some time, yet the focus has
traditionally been on the library patron and on information-seeking
skills and behaviors. Unfortunately, librarians have not been actively
acknowledged as users, and therefore research that focuses on
librarians as adopters of ICTs is scarce. This study is driven by the
recognition of the key role librarians play in the diffusion of
innovation in the library, and by the recognition of the increased need
to understand their behavior toward new ICTs in their everyday life as
a precursor to their role as adopters and disseminators within the
library setting.</p>
<h2>Literature review</h2>
<p>Research regarding adoption, rejection, and dissonance of technology
by librarians is scarce. Much of the research regarding innovativeness
and diffusion of library technology has focused on library patrons such
as faculty or students, and largely uses interviews and other
qualitative methods of data collection (<a href="#starkweather99">Starkweather
&amp; Wallin, 1999</a>). Research related to this study is research
that examines librarians' innovativeness, their attitudes toward and
beliefs about technology, and literature that places innovativeness in
the context of adoption of technology. While some of the literature
identifies opinions of librarians regarding the contribution of
specific technologies to their work, it rarely provides much insight
into attitudes toward ICTs.</p>
<h3>Librarians as users of technology</h3>
<p>Most of the research focusing on librarians as users of technology
investigates librarians' attitudes toward technology in general (<a
 href="#chiang86">Chiang, 1986</a>; <a href="#kahan97">Kahan, 1997</a>;
<a href="#ramzan04">Ramzan 2004</a>; <a href="#spacey03">Spacey
Goulding and Murray 2003</a>; <a href="#stover00a">Stover 2000a</a>),
or more specifically toward the Internet (<a href="#curry00">Curry
&amp; Harris 2000</a>; <a href="#spacey04">Spacey, Goulding and Murray
2004</a>; <a href="#stover00">Stover 2000</a>). In recognition of the
fact that innovativeness affects implementation of ICTs in libraries,
staff training was used as an opportunity to examine attitudes of
librarians (<a href="#spacey03">Spacey et al., 2003</a>). Although
Spacey et al. were primarily concerned with examining the effect of
staff training on acclimating people to the changes around them, they
contend in their 2003 paper that attitudes toward information and
communication technology need to be further examined. The increasing
dominance of the Internet as a reference tool in libraries generated
several studies of attitudes of librarians toward the Internet, some
using personal interviews and online open-ended questionnaires (<a
 href="#curry00">Curry &amp; Harris, 2000</a>; <a href="#stover00">Stover,
2000</a>) and others using established models such as the Technology
Acceptance Model (<a href="#spacey04">Spacey et al., 2004</a>). Curry
and Harris (<a href="#curry00">2000</a>) interviewed 14 subjects about
their views of using the World Wide Web as a reference tool, and found
that the majority of librarians interviewed stated that the Web had a
positive effect on reference work. Stover used a qualitative survey to
find patterns and themes among librarians with regard to their
attitudes toward using the Web as reference tool. Stover discovered
that most librarians see the Web as an important and productive tool,
but suggested that the relatively small sample of 41 used for his study
should be expanded (<a href="#stover00">Stover, 2000</a>).</p>
<p>Studies that tried to identify factors predictive of information
technology (IT) application in libraries include the librarians' level
of technological knowledge and librarians' utilization (<a
 href="#ramzan04">Ramzan, 2004</a>). Focusing solely on librarians in
Pakistan, Ramzan found that knowledge of information technologies had a
significant relationship with librarians' attitudes and with the
likelihood they will use information technology (<a href="#ramzan04">Ramzan,
2004</a>). A 2002 article by Woodard and Hinchliffe offers Rogers'
diffusion of innovation theory as a framework for understanding the
reasons and likelihood that librarians will incorporate technology into
library instruction provided to patrons. The authors approach this
question from a theoretical standpoint only and examine whether the
theory of the diffusion of innovations is an appropriate one for
comprehending the intricate relationship between adopter categories
among library staff and the integration of technology into library
instruction programs (<a href="#woodard02">Woodard and Hinchliffe, 2002</a>).
Another researcher focusing more on theoretical aspects of diffusion
within libraries, but offering some case studies throughout, is Peter
Clayton (<a href="#clayton97">Clayton, 1997</a>). In his book
Implementation of organizational innovation, Clayton focuses primarily
on information retrieval as an example of the implementation of
technological innovation in library settings. While the book is of
value to many groups within the library environment, it is particularly
helpful to library managers who want to learn more about implementation
of innovations. Like Clayton, Pungitore is also concerned with
innovation from an organizational point of view (<a href="#pungitore95">Pungitore,
1995</a>). Her book Innovation and the library describes the spread of
innovations within public libraries. Innovation is seen as the means of
keeping the public library a viable institution and helping in the
transition of the public library from an institution geared primarily
at lower and middle class adults in the mid-nineteenth century, to the
cultural institution it is today (<a href="#pungitore95">Pungitore, 1995</a>).</p>
<p>A 2000 qualitative study solicited librarians' opinions on the role
of technology in libraries (<a href="#stover00">Stover, 2000</a>).
Librarians were asked five questions, including whether they thought
that libraries should be on the cutting edge in terms of technology.
Responses varied greatly, and among the fears expressed were the steep
learning curve required for some technologies (<a href="#stover00">Stover,
2000</a>). Stover's study was not focused exclusively on use of the
Web; rather, it examined librarians' attitudes in general toward
managing technology and technological change. Stover found that with
regard to introducing cutting-edge technology to the library,
librarians hold a wide spectrum of opinions: Some are strong advocates,
others have moderate opinions, and some are distrustful of using
advanced technology in the library (<a href="#stover00">Stover, 2000</a>).</p>
<p>Research that looked at innovativeness in libraries using a
diffusion of innovation framework is infrequent. Two relevant studies,
one by Starkweather and Wallin (<a href="#starkweather99">1999</a>) and
the other by White (<a href="#white01">2001</a>), were identified.
Starkweather and Wallin conducted focus group interviews with a total
of 26 faculty members to study how they adopted new technology at a
university library. The study yielded many interesting findings about
the patterns of use of library technology by faculty interviewed;
however, the researchers acknowledged that they were unable to link
these patterns to adopter categories, perhaps due to their data
collection method.</p>
<p>White (<a href="#white01">2001</a>) examined digital reference
service. She applied the diffusion of innovation framework to interpret
the implementation of digital reference services within academic
libraries. White found that the libraries that were early adopters of
digital reference services tended to be larger, wealthier, had more
staff, and provided more computer-based services than did libraries in
other categories.</p>
<h2>Diffusion and adopter innovativeness</h2>
<p>Researchers have applied many theoretical approaches to understand
how people adopt innovations. A comprehensive examination of the
various theoretical approaches is included in a review article by
Dillon and Morris (<a href="#dillon96">1996</a>), who contend that all
models of adoption are part of the Rogers diffusion of innovation
theory.</p>
<p>Since its publication as a methodology by Rogers in 1962, diffusion
studies have become common in disciplinary and interdisciplinary
research (<a href="#ratzen04">Ratzen, 2004</a>). Rogers and subsequent
researchers have used diffusion to analyze and explain individuals' and
social systems' adoption of new and improved ideas, inventions, and
practices from the perspective of those affected. Rogers (<a
 href="#rogers03">2003</a>) identifies eight types of diffusion
research earliness of knowing about innovations; rate of adoption of
different innovations in a social system; opinion leadership; diffusion
networks; rate of adoption in different social systems; communication
channel usage; consequences of innovation; and adopter innovativeness.</p>
<p>In 1958, Rogers empirically standardized the innovativeness of
individuals and social systems and organized it into adopter
categories. Adopter categories are a descriptive method for classifying
the members of a system based on their adoption of new innovations in
relation to their peers. In a normal-frequency distribution, there are
five adopter categories: innovators (2.5%), early adopters (13.5%),
early majority (34%), late majority (34%), and laggards (16%).</p>
<p> Innovators, the earliest adopters, are the most entrepreneurial and
likely to adopt a new technology before their peers. As tinkerers, this
group tends to have an uncanny willingness to seek out new innovations
that interest them. They have a high tolerance for learning new
innovations on their own, and the result tends to be intrinsic, rather
than peer-related, reward. They tend to be not as influential in the
innovation-decision process as the next category.</p>
<p>Unlike innovators, early adopters tend to be interested in the
extrinsic reward, the admiration that early adoption will bring from
their peers. This category tends to have the highest level of opinion
leaders. Because they tend to be opinion leaders, by their adoption or
nonadoption early adopters serve as the tipping point for the eventual
success or failure of new innovations.</p>
<p> As a large group, the early majority tend not to be opinion
leaders. Yet their adoption decision represents the first mainstream
adoption group and often legitimizes the innovation as positive and
therefore adoptable.
Adoption by the late majority, the fourth category, is often driven by
either economic necessity or motivated by peer pressure (<a
 href="#rogers03">Rogers 2003</a>). This group tends to accept
innovation slowly and often requires formal or informal training or
remedial assistance before full adoption.</p>
<p>Laggards represent the final adopter category. Laggards have a
tendency to move "forward through the rearview mirror" and associate
with like-minded peers. By looking to the past as a framework for
coping with change, laggards tend to justify their opposition to new
innovations by stating their continued happiness with things the way
they currently are or have always been.</p>
<h2>Methodology and data collection</h2>
<p>Since surveys are typically evaluative rather than generative, and
provide broad results that can be projected to the total population,
the researchers determined that an online questionnaire was the best
method for gathering the most diverse data. The questionnaire was
tested for reliability and validity with a sample population, then
refined and retested with a different population and refined yet again.
The final distributed questionnaire included two parts for a total of
39 questions. Part one consisted of eight questions that sought
demographic data and the respondents' general everyday-life attitude
toward the adoption of ICTs. Results from part one were used for this
study on librarian innovativeness. Part two was used for a study on the
relative advantage of innovations.</p>
<p>To ensure a wide distribution, identical e-mails were sent to
library- and librarian-related listservs. The e-mail contained a brief
introduction to the study and a link to the online questionnaire. The
questionnaire was available for two weeks during late spring 2006.</p>
<p>In response to the survey, 1,417 responses were received. Of these
1,128 were fully completed, considered valid, and used for inquiry. Of
the 1,128 valid responses 926 (88%) were from the United States and 202
(12%) were international responses. The U.S. responses were diverse,
representing more than 300 distinct zip codes. The quantity and
diversity of international responses were surprising and welcome.
Surprising, because the survey was distributed to listservs intended
for a U.S. audience, and welcome because this demonstrated the
existence of wide "nets" cast by library- and librarian-related
listservs.</p>
<p>To develop a general demographic picture of the respondent
population, a few personal and career-oriented questions were asked.
Two questions related to personal demographics. The first was the
respondents' age, the second was the number of years they have worked
in a library. Questions related to career also included two, the type
of library environment respondents worked in, and their primary
responsibility within that environment.</p>
<p>A single question was used to identify adopter category. Respondents
were asked to self-identify which of five categories they fall under
when adopting new technologies such as cellular phones and electronic
gadgets. Category options available were: first on the block; among the
first; just before everyone else; when everyone else does; last on the
block. As per Rogers, adopter categories are associated with an
individual's willingness to adopt new technological innovations and
are, by extension, a measure of innovativeness. For this question, no
library-specific technology was used to lead respondents. Instead,
everyday-life technologies were referenced, and the respondents'
likelihood of adopting these technologies in relation to "friends and
colleagues" was assessed.</p>
<h2>Findings</h2>
<p>Results revealed that the age of respondents increased consistently
from the first group under 30 (9.8%) to 51 - 60 (35.1%). A major
drop-off was observed in the number of respondents over age 60 (TABLE
1). This age distribution was consistent with the 1999 American Library
Association (ALA) survey that demonstrated the existence of a "graying"
of the profession (<a href="#lynch99">Lynch, 2000</a>).</p>

<p>Primary role responses (Table 4) revealed that the majority of
respondents (again over 70%) were involved in one of two roles, public
services (41%) or administration (31.4%). Of international responses
22% were for other. This high percentage was attributed to the
different ways in which librarian roles are defined internationally.</p>

<p>Table 5 shows the results for the adopter category question. More
than 60% of respondents were in two categories: late majority (37%) and
early adopters (24.6%). Following these were laggards (17.7%) and early
majority (17.2%), which were just about equal. Lastly, innovators
represented 3.6% of respondents.
These results were surprising. In some instances they deviated
considerably from the normal distribution frequently attributed to
adopter categories. Aggregate data provided by Rogers (2003) suggests
the following normal distribution of adopters based on their
innovativeness: 2.5% innovators, 13.5% early adopters, 34% early
majority, 34% late majority, and 16% laggards.</p>

<p>As presented graphically in Figure 1, the distribution of librarians
among adopter categories deviates substantially from the normal adopter
distribution curve described by Rogers.</p>
<p>The comparison between Roger's normal distribution and the
respondent data shows that late majority (+3.0%), laggards (+1.7%), and
innovators (+1.1%) were consistent. Disparity was significant in two
categories, early adopters (+11.1%) and early majority (-16.8%). When
plotted, these findings reveal a chasm surrounded by two humps. The
data suggests that innovations in library settings may be difficult to
diffuse efficiently and effectively.</p>

<strong>Figure 1. <em>Rate of Adoption of Technology</em></strong></div>
<p>Problems in the efficient and effective diffusion of innovations in
libraries may begin early in the diffusion process, appearing as soon
as early adopters come into contact with the innovation and then
continuing, with compounding consequences, throughout the diffusion
process. The unusually high percentage of early adopters, one-quarter
of all respondents, may cause problems with opinion leadership, mainly
too many opinion leaders promoting too many variant opinions. This
problem then steamrolls into the next stage of adopters: early
majority. Here the percentage of adopters was unusually low. The result
is too many opinion leaders with too many opinions attempting to
influence too few early majority. As one heads back up the far side of
the chasm to the late majority, problems will likely continue. Here,
though, one encounters the reverse of the previous problem: instead of
too much influence there seems to be too little.</p>
<p>With these general findings in mind, the next step was to compare
the general distribution of adopter categories with the demographic
variables toward innovativeness. These findings reinforced the general
distribution findings. Regardless of age range (Figure 2), the type of
library environment (Figure 3), years working in a library (Figure 4),
or primary role (Figure 5), one observes a chasm surrounded by two
humps.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Given the surprising and consistent findings presented above, how
might innovation diffusion problems manifest themselves, regardless of
specific demographic consideration? We identified three problem areas,
of perhaps many: the plethora of opinion leadership, deceleration in
adoption, and improper re-invention. Each of these problems lies
farther along the diffusion process than the previous one. Therefore
one can anticipate that they may be connected and build off one another.</p>
<h3>Diversity of impact of opinion leaders</h3>
<p>Diffusion researchers have found that early adopters, rather than
innovators, are the group that speeds up or slows down the diffusion of
innovations. Early adopters are seen by their peers as the key
influencers of attitudes, beliefs, and overt opinions about the value
of new innovations. This means that most opinion leaders cluster within
the early adopter category. As opinion leaders, early adopters tend to
develop, test, and evaluate the benefits and side effects of an
innovation within specific contexts of use (e.g., within the library
where they work). If they perceive an innovation to be beneficial early
adopters, through their opinion leadership, seek to trigger the
critical mass of early majority adopters that is needed to encourage
sustained diffusion.</p>
<p>Acknowledging early adopters as opinion leaders in the diffusion
process, the data suggest that at least two serious problems may emerge
in the diffusion of innovations into a library setting: Too many
opinion leaders influencing too few early adopters.</p>
<p>Too many opinion leaders may create too many divergent opinions and
fragment perceptions about the benefits of new innovations. This occurs
not only in evaluating benefits but in deciding which competing
innovations are evaluated at all. So at such an early point in the
diffusion process, unusual complexities may be abnormally diverse. The
problem is compounded by the sharp decline in the number of adopters
from the early adopter to the early majority category. This chasm is
problematic because it represents the amount of resistance that must be
overcome for adoption to continue (see <a href="#moore91">Moore, 1991</a>).
Here too many opinion leaders are influencing and vying for the support
from too few early majority. This makes the innovation-decision process
unnecessarily complex, and in turn, time consuming, for the early
majority. This problem may then instigate another problem, a
deceleration in the rate of adoption.</p>
<h3>Deceleration in rate of adoption</h3>
<p>As an innovation diffuses through adopter categories, the
willingness of individuals to accept an innovation decreases. Therefore
it is more challenging and requires more effort for an early majority
to accept a new innovation than it is for an early adopter to do so. To
alleviate this pressure, members of later adopter categories look to
those individuals in the previous adopter category for guidance and
support when adopting new innovations. A potential by-product of
insufficient guidance from adopters from earlier adopter categories is
a deceleration in the rate of adoption.</p>
<p>The data show an uncharacteristic dip between early adopters and
early majority. The potential effect of this dip is that, due to lack
of influence from their closest peer adopter category, the diffusion of
innovations in library settings may decelerate rather than accelerate,
as is usual. The tipping point is thus imperiled, and the effort needed
to move toward and then through it may be quite high. When the
diffusion of an innovation slows, or if the influence of previous
adopter categories is simply too weak, another situation may arise:
Re-invention.</p>
<h3>Re-invention</h3>
<p>Re-invention is a third problem that tends to arise when adopter
categories are unequally distributed or influence from previous adopter
categories is weak. In much the same way that a messages changes each
time it is passed on, as participants in the adoption and
implementation process, individuals actively deviate from the intended
use of new innovations. This deviation, whether intentional or
unintentional, conscious or unconscious, is called re-invention.</p>
<p>Under normal diffusion, re-invention is considered both normal and
healthy. It is normal in that new innovations should be flexible enough
to adapt to the unique needs of the environment in which they are being
implemented. It is healthy in that the potential for limited
re-invention gives adopters a greater feeling, actual or perceived, of
ownership and inclusion in the diffusion of the innovation. In order to
accept an innovation, adopters make it their own and in making it their
own, they change it to fit their perceived needs. Re-invention causes
problems when innovations are adopted and used in unintended or
discursive ways. A major cause of improper re-invention is partial or
inaccurate knowledge or information of the innovations' intended or
preferred use.</p>
<p>Data revealed a sharp decline from early adopters to early majority
and then a sharp increase from early majority to late majority. This
chasm, particularly as it relates to the rise up the far side, should
cause concern for improper re-invention in libraries. Here, the late
majority may lack the peer guidance, or peer pressure, to adopt
innovations and use them in their intended ways. Problems may arise
either psychologically or through use. Psychologically, adopters
without sufficient guidance and thorough knowledge may use re-invention
as a defense mechanism. Here, the issue is one of control. The adopters
will accept the innovation, but only on their own terms. Through use,
re-invention may occur when adopters do not perceive the intended
relationships between themselves and the innovation. Rather than
forming the required concomitant relationship, a fragmented one is
formed.</p>
<h2>Conclusion and recommendations </h2>
<p>Our study examined the innovativeness of librarians with regard to
their willingness to adopt ICTs. While the responses to the survey drew
an instantly recognizable pattern, one needs to keep in mind the
limitations of this study. The results were self reported by
respondents who were asked to define their innovativeness in relation
to their peers. As with all self reporting, personal biases may taint
the results. In addition, the method of distribution for this survey
was unrestricted. Future research may try to triangulate the results
with a controlled sample.</p>
<p>Using an online questionnaire and results from more than 1,000
respondents, distinct and consistent patterns were revealed. The data
suggest that, when considered as a whole, librarians' attitude towards
new innovations is unevenly distributed, with most either accepting of
new innovations or being late adopters. These findings were consistent
regardless of demographic variables. Age, role, tenure, and library
type were shown to have little effect on librarians' attitude toward
the adoption of ICT innovations.</p>
<p> The findings suggest that some of the conventional wisdoms
regarding information professionals and their willingness to adopt new
ICT innovations may be incorrect. Contrary to common beliefs,
librarians in academic or special libraries are no more innovative than
public or school librarians. Technical service librarians are not more
innovative than public service librarians. Older librarians seem only a
little less likely to accept innovations, and administrators appear to
be no more innovative than the employees they supervise. </p>
<p> We discussed three concerns associated with the effects of adopter
distribution on the successful diffusion of ICT innovations within
libraries: lack of impact of opinion leaders, deceleration in the rate
of adoption, and distortion during the re-invention process.</p>
<p>The unique effect of context on attitude and diffusion was not a
variable in this study. Additional research using case studies of
individual libraries should be completed. Further research also needs
to take into consideration the advantages and disadvantages that
librarians assign to specific innovations as they begin to diffuse into
their working environment. This exploratory research identified the
diffusion of innovation framework as a viable, and perhaps more
people-centered, approach to investigating the implementation and
acceptance of ICTs within libraries by the people who use them.</p>

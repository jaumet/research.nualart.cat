<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p> In some respects it seems as if we are moving into the future at great speed.
  In other respects developments seem irksomely slow. What do we know about the
  future? What we know about the present is probably as much as we know about
  the future. What we do have a chance to know something about, is the past. All
  our imaginings about the future are projections of a more or less conscious
  knowledge of the past. We are moving, metaphorically speaking, into the future
  with our backs first, facing the past. As the human species has not changed
  for at least a hundred thousand years, we are not at liberty to ignore the decisions
  of our predecessors. There is no requirement to forget or neglect previous conclusions
  on the same kind of issues that we are facing now, instead we have a lot to
  learn - preferably at a conscious level. </p>
<h2>The Bologna Declaration</h2>
<p>All over Europe the educational institutions, including those of the library
  and information science field, are planning on how to respond to the Bologna
  Declaration. The three legs that underpin the Declaration have to be considered:
  European competitiveness, student and faculty mobility, and employability. In
  addition there are two academic levels to take into account - of which one is
  an advanced level. Mobility is a straightforward issue; synchronizing European
  syllabi and curricula is an instrument in itself to promote mobility. The origin
  of the reform in economic politics is encompassed in the concept of competitiveness.
</p>
<p>Then, there is the issue of employability. Is employability to be interpreted
  as prioritising skills? Or, are the two levels to be interpreted as laying the
  ground for theoretical understanding on the first level in order to make the
  passage to the advanced level possible? Is the true meaning of professionalism
  only possible at the advanced level? Have similar problems been solved before?
</p>
<h2>Short overview</h2>
<p>We can take a closer look at the Swedish example. In a few words - and oversimplified
  - it looks like this: The developments of half a century led to professional
  status for public librarians in the 1950s and 1960s. It was achieved through
  a combination of academic studies and a professional education. Recommendations
  made by library representatives to the political level combined with initiatives
  by the politicians themselves led to the reformation of the education of librarians
  in the 1970s. Skills were foregrounded at the expense of a theoretic understanding
  of the professions' knowledge base to the extent that the professional status,
  in its academic definition, of the public library collective was lost. Another
  political initiative in the 1990s abrogated the vocational library school and
  its diploma but gave rise to an MA (the BA attracted very few) in library and
  information science: academia prevailed, the development of skills faded in
  significance and interest in professionalism in the sense of theoretically founded
  knowledge had a revival. In the second half of the first decade of the third
  millennium the question is: will an emphasis on skills, like the Phoenix, rise
  to such a level as to impair professional status again? </p>
<h2>The Swedish example</h2>
<p>The early 20th century saw rapid changes in Swedish society. There was a boom
  in industrialisation; the growth rates equalled the tiger economies of later
  days; the class of industrial workers was growing and so was the class of merchants
  and industrialists while classes connected to agriculture were not. With great
  simplification these three groups can be identified as socialists, liberals
  and conservatives. The restrictions (wealth and income) in the voting system
  favoured landowners. Liberals and socialists, however, broadened their influence
  in parliament, as income rose generally in the wake of the boom. Government
  was undergoing change to a parliamentary system and universal suffrage was on
  the agenda. Universal suffrage for men was granted in 1909. Socialists and liberals
  cooperated on full universal suffrage which was finalised in 1919/1921. In 1920
  the liberals in parliament declined the king's proposal to form a government
  and advised him to ask the socialists instead; this event marked the full implementation
  of the parliamentary system of government disguised under the formality of Royal
  Majesty. </p>
<p>Popular education was an issue in the beginning of the 20th century for all
  parts; it was deemed necessary to educate people in social issues when a vote
  was going to be entrusted to every individual. The socialists needed educated
  people to be able to take power while conservatives and liberals believed popular
  education would counteract revolutionary ideas. One can observe then, that popular
  education, though relatively undisputed, was a major issue in Swedish politics
  in those days; the underlying logic of the different proponents was nonetheless
  very different. At the same time, all the important forces in the political
  field wanted to promote public libraries. (Torstensson <a href="#tor96">1996</a>)
</p>
<p>In 1905 state support to public libraries was initiated; it was augmented in
  1912 in the ordinance of 1930, and led to a real expansion of the public library
  system. (Regeringen <a href="#reg30">1930</a>) </p>
<p>Public libraries in Sweden have been publicly owned and locally funded by municipalities
  for the last forty years and some even earlier. The Gothenburg Public Library
  opened in 1862 (in the second largest city in Sweden), while the Stockholm City
  Public Library opened as late as 1928; in both cases a donation was needed to
  get them started. (Atlestam et al. <a href="#atl97">1997</a>; Myrstener <a href="#myr96">1996</a>)
  The picture of the public libraries during the first half of the 20th century
  is varied. The early years saw public libraries established by popular movements,
  particularly the workers' movement (Stockholm is a prominent example (Myrstener
  <a href="#myr98">1998</a>)), the temperance movement, and also by the church
  to some extent. However, important libraries established by popular movements
  were few compared to municipality libraries, 5 out of about 80 in 1932. (Norlind
  <a href="#nor32">1932</a>) As late as 1953, however, movement libraries outnumbered
  municipality libraries by 2294 to 933. (Table 1) </p>

<p>Figures in table 1 suggest that an average workers' or temperance movement
  library had a stock of less than 700 items, and less than 100 users. Fully educated
  librarians were not to be found to manage operations on such a small scale;
  instead there were a great number of part-timers, often idealists, combining
  an employment for sustenance with library operations in their free time. </p>
<p>There was a drive towards running public libraries through the municipalities
  instead of through ideologically based popular movements. State support worked
  in this direction with government inquiries at intervals pointing the way. The
  powers trusted in the library consultants of the Government Board of Education
  to oversee public libraries from 1912 had a similar effect. The library association
  was founded in 1915 - their journal started the following year - favoured professionalisation.
  One peculiarly politically uninformed government inquiry (Folkbibliotekssakkunniga
  <a href="#fol49">1949</a>) proposed -- under the impression that the time was
  ripe, to end support to movement libraries. (State support to individual public
  libraries did not end until 1966, when support instead focused on the regional
  level.) The drive to build library units in the municipalities big enough to
  support fulltime employees paved the way for a cadre of professional public
  librarians. </p>
<p>The students of the library school from 1926 and onwards worked for the development
  of librarian status. A series of events that marked the development of professional
  status can be illustrated by examples from the G&ouml;teborg Public Library. Maria
  Larsen was the librarian 1905-1934. She had no specific education but was a
  successful manager. Her successor1934-1960 was Svea Bredal. She was a qualified
  teacher and had attended the library school; she commanded several European
  languages and had proved her managerial skills. The regional librarian at the
  same time was a man (Nils Genell) who held an MA in addition to having attended
  the library school. In 1948 there was a reorganization of the library; the academic
  competence of the librarians was recognised. As Atlestam et al. (<a href="#atl97">1997</a>;
  <a href="#atl03">2003</a>) have shown both Larsen and Bredal experienced in
  turn how their form of competence was surpassed. Academically founded theoretical
  knowledge came to prevail. </p>
<p>The library school had from its start in 1926 recruited people with different
  educational backgrounds. In 1943 it was decided that Bachelor level was required
  for admittance to the library school. The necessity of an academic background
  was questioned repeatedly in writing and in practice; looking at figures below
  (diagrams 1 and 2) the impression is that academic qualifications prevailed
  from 1955 and onwards. It is probable that an administrative decision taken
  in 1943 genuinely influenced the following development. </p>
<p>The figures available (table 2) on the situation in Sweden during the first
  two thirds of the 20th century indicate that 30% of fulltime staff, all library
  types included, did not have the required academic qualifications; half of them
  were, however, qualified to enter university. Due to staff cross-over habits
  there is a difficulty in determining and separating public libraries. </p>

<p>Putting the same figures on a timeline chart (diagram 1) the steady increase,
  peaking after the world war years, in the recruitment of the Bachelor level
  group is clearly noticeable. Looking at the Bachelor level specifically (diagram
  2) and at the division between women and men, there is a ratio of about 80 to
  20. It was only at the Ph.D. level, and in academic libraries, that librarianism
  can be described as a male stronghold. (Seld&eacute;n <a href="#sel07">2007</a>) The

<p>While studying the recruitment practices of public libraries in the available
  data 1944-1966 there are interesting findings. 1944 was chosen as starting point
  for the study due to the library school entry requirement of 1943, mentioned
  above. From the author's database built on the four library registers one can
  compute that 94% (565 out of 598) of the public librarians recruited between
  1944 and 1966 had a Bachelor level qualification or more. Stockholm city library
  is not included in these figures. The Stockholm city library had a very different
  ratio: only 50% (57 out of 113) were qualified; the difference was due to a
  policy of recruiting locally and readily accessible, inexpensive staff that
  had little opportunity to find other employers. For the same reason the Stockholm
  city library maintained a library school of its own between 1948 and 1977. They
  recruited school graduates which accounts for a substantial part of the bubble
  mentioned above. </p>
<p>The late 1940s saw the completion of two government inquiries one on popular
  education and one on public libraries. The former (1944 &aring;rs folkbildningsutredning
  <a href="#a19446">1946</a>) was politically accepted and absorbed financial resources
  at the expense of public libraries. Although the cause of public libraries did
  not win political favour the inquiry was influential regarding goal formulations
  in library discourse. (Folkbibliotekssakkunniga <a href="#fol49">1949</a>) Issues
  of democracy and formal education were included as a rationale. An expansion
  of the public library system in the following decades and ensuing problems with
  staffing were foreseen. The necessity of an academic education was questioned.
  Only five years earlier the standard of an academic qualification as entry requirement
  to the library school had been formalised. While the inquiry was in progress
  the Stockholm City Public Library had started, as is already mentioned, its
  own library school in 1948 in order to access inexpensive staff by doing away
  with the requirements for an academic education. The Stockholm City Library
  School articulated a - ridiculous - claim to provide an education at a University
  Bachelor level. (Ahlstedt <a href="#ahl50">1950</a>) The actions of the Stockholm
  City Library and the hesitance towards academic education voiced by the inquiry
  may be connected. The trade union for public librarians took exception to the
  anti-academic ideas and ignited a public debate. (Nilsson <a href="#nil50">1950</a>)
</p>
<p>During the 1950s there were several serious proposals regarding education
  for library work in the library association and in the trade union. (Svenska
  folkbibliotekarief&ouml;reningens utbildningskommitt&eacute; 1952, <a href="#sve56">1956</a>)
  They were all scuttled, delaying a solution by twenty years. The chair of the
  government inquiry that articulated the unpopular views that the necessity of
  academic qualifications for librarianship were questionable, may appear to have
  been a humble city librarian from a small town, but he was also a Member of
  Parliament, to become speaker of the house, and also chair of the library association.
  Whether the issue of lowering enrolment standards was just a skilful forecast
  by the inquiry or actually had an impact on practices for some time in the 1950s
  is open to question. During the rest of the period ending in 1972 practice walked
  in the academic direction. It should be pointed out to non-Swedish readers that
  the system of government public inquiries was (still is) a standing feature
  in Swedish politics; their proposals were normally very influential and formed
  the foundation for government propositions for parliamentary decisions; the
  public library inquiry's failure to do so was an exception. </p>
<p>Popular education in movement based study circles was no longer the focal point
  in Swedish politics in the 1960s as it used to be; formal education was more
  of an issue. Secondary education and universities expanded. Resources in society
  were no longer scarce; there were no forces to stop the momentum in building
  the countrywide municipal public library. </p>
<p>In 1966 a numerically strong group of experts, librarians and archivists, started
  working on a government inquiry on library education, which after three years
  led to a parliamentary decision to create the Swedish School of Library and
  Information Science in 1972. (Utredningen r&ouml;rande utbildning av bibliotekspersonal
  mm <a href="#utr69">1969</a>) Their idea of a library education was a four year
  combination of university and library studies. The main concern was to bring
  about a long enough education; they seem to have forgotten the academic level
  as the combination meant a reduction from Bachelor to diploma status. Another
  important concern was to place the education as a separate unit directly under
  the government. At the political level the proposal meant that there was no
  need to provide the library education with a scholarly staff. Political ideas
  on opening higher education to broader groups in society turned library education
  into an experimental field for later (1977) higher education reforms. Minimum
  entry standards were low; a lottery made up 25% of the intake; it was even possible
  to avoid the university part of the four year combination; academically highly
  qualified applicants were rejected. The organizing committee of the reformed
  school found a need to augment the library part of the studies; this meant more
  and longer courses on how to run library operations. The committee did not try
  to compensate for what was lost by doing away with the university Bachelor exam.
  The teaching staff could not be recruited on their scholarly merits but for
  their library achievements. The library field understood the shortcomings of
  the education but did not appreciate the reasons for them. </p>
<p>In 1986 only 60% (out of a total number of 2418) of the public librarians had
  a BA level education or more to add on to their library school qualifications;
  16% had no other higher education than the library school. The number of academic
  credits sank measurably in the group as a collective. The library system had
  expanded, but the collective academic standard of the public library staff had
  substantially diminished during 20 years. I may be allowed to interpret this
  as deprofessionalisation. (N&auml;ttorp <a href="#nat87">1987</a>; Enmark &amp; Seld&eacute;n
  <a href="#enm98">1998</a>) </p>
<p>The definition here of professionalism is rather traditional. A point of departure
  is Andrew Abbot (<a href="#abb88">1988</a>): &quot;... professions are exclusive
  occupational groups applying somewhat abstract knowledge to particular cases.&quot;
  Criteria include: a common base of theoretical knowledge, long education, formal
  examination, a national level organization, professional culture, professional
  authority, societal sanction, ethical codes, monopoly, and jurisdiction. Most
  of that was achieved in the late 1950s and much of it lost by the 1980s. Regarding
  Abbot's arguments around semiprofessions I tend to agree with Ann Witz (<a href="#">1992</a>):
  &quot;because women are not men, 'semiprofessions' are not professions&quot;
</p>
<p>The higher education act of 1993 meant a clean slate for library and information
  science. The library school disappeared and with it, its certification; its
  educational monopoly also disappeared. The discipline of Library and information
  science had been established in 1991 by a parliamentary act that introduced
  a chair at G&ouml;teborg University. Education at a particular Swedish combination
  of a three year undergraduate level and a one-year Master level was launched.
  The required thesis comprised half an academic year. There existed a bachelor
  education too, but not in much use. These educations have been in operation
  for 14 years, resulting in the resurrection of a collective academic and professional
  status of Swedish public librarians. </p>
<p>There is one particular connotation in the concepts of the Bologna process
  that rings a bell in the Swedish ear: employability. The 1977 higher education
  act prescribed that all higher education should prepare students for occupations.
  At least in the case of library and information science, this was interpreted
  in the following way: the student should, after education, be able to perform
  practical library operations directly. A majority of the courses were constructed
  in that way. Once again more emphasis was put on how to do it rather than how
  to think about it. </p>
<p>The scholarly level of the educational staff is at an infinitely higher level
  than 30 years ago. Inoculation against populism in education is stronger; however,
  the political will to increase productivity in institutions of higher education
  is also strong and is witnessed in terms of a rationalised and ever faster flow
  of students through the system. Employers will always want to have staff functioning
  with a minimum on-site training. Students in an industrialised education may
  resort to, at least in some cases, to a minimalist approach to studies. There
  are challenges. Educational quality on the first level has to be of a calibre
  that allows passage to an advanced level. It is still necessary to produce academics,
  not only units of production. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The professionalisation process of public librarians in Sweden has had its
  ups and downs. An obvious milestone was the Bachelor enrolment requirement introduced
  1943. Towards the second half of the 1950s hardly anyone was recruited as a
  public librarian without the prerequisite education with its double bases in
  both academic studies and profession skills. My meaning is that the idea of
  the professional public librarian had been realised already. What is more, it
  was a woman's profession. The situation at the Stockholm City Library was a
  drastic exception. The reformation of the library school in 1972 entailed something
  other than professionalisation - rather deprofessionalisation. </p>
<p>The act of parliament of 1977 prescribed that all higher education should prepare
  for working life, thus sharpening the occupational edge. Although time spent
  on studies was still almost the same as earlier, academic standards were lowered
  from Bachelor level to diploma level generally, although it would be unfair
  to claim that this was true of every individual case, however, the principle
  prevailed. The level of academic education measured in credit points sank measurably
  (N&auml;ttorp <a href="#nat87">1987</a>) in the group as a collective. </p>
<p>The act of 1992 altered the situation again. A long list of purely vocational
  programs in higher education were abrogated. The discipline of Library and Information
  Science replaced the library school qualifications. Theoretical and methodological
  courses replaced hands-on courses. The academic level was raised to Master in
  almost every case. A new era of professionalisation started. The Bologna mantra
  of employability echoes, however, the prescription of 1977 act. Will the Bachelor
  level or the Master level prevail at public libraries, this time? Does the Bologna
  model mean more how-to-do-it courses? Does the Bologna process threaten professionalisation?
  The educational institutions in Sweden are academically definitely better prepared
  in 2007 than they were in 1972. Pressures from employers regarding readymade
  staff, from politicians regarding a faster flow of students through the education
  industry, from a group of students with minimalist ambitions, may give rise
  to an easy way round academic ambitions. </p>

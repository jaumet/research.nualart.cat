<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>  This research provides innovative insight into issues currently in focus within
    higher educational spheres, particularly within knowledge construction, evaluation
    and utilisation, as well as illuminating principal areas within pedagogical
    study that are increasingly under scrutiny, as educational institutions attempt
    to match the outcomes and expectations of today&#8217;s society and improving
learning outcomes.</p>
<p> Issues such as educator facilitation and learner-centred instructional paradigms 
  have emerged as critically important aspirations within new dynamic educational 
  environments and domains (<a href="#schu06">Schuman and Ritchie, 2006</a>).</p>
<p> Learners, however, have their own unique perspectives, experiences, and learning 
  styles, as Gopnik and Meltzoff (<a href="#gop97">1997</a>) state in discussion 
  of their &#8220;Theory theory&#8221;, underlying any human cognitive activity 
  is an abstract structure that is not all that apparent in superficial phenomenology 
  or practice (<a href="#gop97">Gopnik and Meltzoff, 1997</a>).</p>
<p> These uniquely developed structures affect how learners interact socially 
  and intellectually within their learning environment, as well as how they interact 
  with any forms of technology used within their selected educational facility 
  (<a href="#col03">Colbeck, 2003</a>).</p>
<p>  The educator&#8217;s role is also changing in order to help facilitate the
    learner&#8217;s progression, with constructive, guiding and efficacious methodologies
    that give the learner time to practice new skills, and draw conclusions relevant
to their own unique experiences.</p>
<p>This research is aimed toward understanding learner&#8217;s
    epistemological belief structures as well as understanding ontological knowledge
    genesis process. </p>
<p>The goals of this research include; </p>
<ol>
  <li>  The format of the new research instrument would be easy to distribute,
    collate and analyse.</li>
  <li> The data gathered by the new research instrument would illustrate a
    clearer structure of the beliefs of learners.</li>
  <li>The new research instrument
      would be reliable enough to be able to extend into additional exploratory
      research.</li>
  <li>The exploratory results would assist understanding the knowledge creation
    processes. </li>
</ol>
<h2>Rationale behind the research</h2>
<p> This project commenced with the desire to understand more intimately the initial
  processes that humans undertake when creating knowledge. <br />
  Providing a high degree of confidence within the research would be necessary
  so it was decided that peer acknowledged pieces of research be studied and
if possible, extended to suit the needs of the study.</p>
<p> In 1990, Marlene Schommer (now Schommer-Aikins) developed an epistemological 
  beliefs survey instrument within her dissertation (89-24938) that assessed her 
  hypothesised structure of five more-or-less independent beliefs among college 
  students (<a href="#sch90">Schommer-Aikins, 1990</a>). This pencil &amp; paper 
  instrument, along with some personal encouragement from Marlene Schommer-Aikins 
  (<a href="#sch05">Schommer-Aikins, 2005</a>), appeared to offer the ability 
  to provide the necessary baseline data for this research project.</p>
<p> This existing survey instrument was re-crafted so that the language within
  the statements would be more easily comprehended by the targeted participants,
  and the analysis of the results being more explicit and particular to the purpose
  required within this research. <br />
  After careful study of the original Schommer-Aikins research, the Epistemological
  Beliefs Sampler (EBS) was developed.</p>
<h2>Literature review</h2>
<p> Epistemology and epistemological beliefs are those concepts concerning the 
  nature of knowledge and learning as well as beliefs about how individuals come 
  to know, how knowledge is constructed and how knowledge is evaluated (<a href="#tol02">Tolhurst 
  and Debus, 2002</a>, <a href="#hof02">Hofer and Pintrich, 2002</a>, <a href="#sch02">Schommer-Aikins, 
  2002</a>, <a href="#sch04">Schommer-Aikins, 2004</a>, <a href="#sch98">Schommer-Aikins, 
  1998</a>).</p>
<p> Some argue that epistemological theories do have major limitations, but Hjorland 
  (<a href="#hjo02">2002</a>) states that these theories are the best general 
  models we have and that their importance is widely recognised (<a href="#hjo02">Hjorland, 
  2002</a>).</p>
<p> Perry (<a href="#per68">1968</a>) is generally credited for initiating the 
  current interest in the exploration of peoples&#8217; beliefs about knowledge 
  and learning and how they change over time. He and his colleagues developed 
  a paper-and-pencil Likert scale to measure peoples&#8217; beliefs. This instrument, 
  called the Checklist of Educational Views (CLEV), was introduced and readministered 
  to 31 students at Harvard over a period of some 4 years, resulting in some 98 
  recorded interviews.</p>
<p> Perry later confirmed the model developed by his earlier work by conducting 
  a further 366 interviews. Perry and his colleagues had found evidence that college 
  students&#8217; beliefs about knowledge changed over time, but more importantly 
  they found that these beliefs could be assessed with their pencil-and&#8211;paper 
  test, the CLEV (<a href="#per68">Perry, 1968</a>, <a href="#sch90">Schommer-Aikins, 
  1990</a>, <a href="#sch04">Schommer-Aikins, 2004</a>, <a href="#schr02">Schraw 
  and Bendixen et al., 2002</a>).</p>
<p> Perry concluded that many first year students believe that simple, unchangeable 
  facts are handed down by omniscient authority. By the time they reach their 
  senior year, students believe that complex tentative knowledge is derived from 
  reason and empirical enquiry (<a href="#sch04">Schommer-Aikins, 2004</a>).</p>
<p> In 1990 Marlene Schommer-Aikins developed the Epistemological Beliefs Questionnaire 
  (EQ), this was a departure from the more developmental approach to a system 
  of five (5) more-or-less independent beliefs. These hypothesised beliefs included 
  beliefs about (a) the stability of knowledge, (b) the structure of knowledge, 
  (c) the source of knowledge, (d) the speed of learning and (e) the ability to 
  learn (<a href="#sch04">Schommer-Aikins, 2004</a>).</p>
<p> Since the inception of this instrument; many other researchers have taken 
  it upon themselves to attempt the development of better instruments. Schommer-Aikins 
  (2002) states that there has been some discussion toward some of these developments 
  insomuch as some researchers have found her instrument to be a useful predictor 
  of a learner&#8217;s belief structure (<a href="#hal96">Hall and Chiarello et 
  al., 1996</a>, <a href="#win98">Windschitl and Andre, 1998</a>, <a href="#sch02">Schommer-Aikins, 
  2002</a>).</p>
<p>Some researchers have worked towards a more psychometrically sound instrument. 
  For example, Jheng et al (<a href="#jhe93">1993</a>) followed up on Schommer-Aikins 
  work by comparing epistemological beliefs of students across different majors 
  and between educational levels (Jheng and Johnson et al., 1993). His instrument 
  was constructed based on questionnaires developed by Schommer-Aikins (<a href="#sch90">1990</a>) 
  in (<a href="#sch02">Schommer-Aikins, 2002</a>).</p>
<p> Jheng et al&#8217;s questionnaire attempted to measure four of the five epistemological 
  beliefs hypothesized by Schommer-Aikins including beliefs in the stability of 
  knowledge, the source of knowledge, the speed of learning, and the ability to 
  learn. A fifth belief, the orderly process of learning replaced Schommer-Aikins 
  hypothesized belief about the structure of knowledge (<a href="#due01">Duell 
  and Schommer-Aikins, 2001</a>).</p>
<p> Other researchers have used the instrument as a starting point to go on and 
  develop their own method of measuring epistemological beliefs. Schraw et al 
  (<a href="#schr95">1995</a>) proposed and created the Epistemological Beliefs 
  Inventory (EBI). Their goal was to develop an alternate tool that would capture 
  all the original beliefs initially hypothesised by Schommer-Aikins (<a href="#schr95">Schraw 
  and Dunkle et al., 1995</a>, <a href="#kar96">Kardash and Scholes, 1996</a>, 
  <a href="#due01">Duell and Schommer-Aikins, 2001</a>).</p>
<p>The EBS instrument developed for this study would be found in the latter developmental
  discussions as it is primarily based on the concepts explored by the Schommer-Aikins
63 question Epistemological Beliefs Questionnaire.</p>
<h2>The Epistemological Beliefs Sampler (EBS)</h2>
<p> However, like some of the researchers mentioned previously, some concepts 
  in developing this new instrument would have to be re-examined, as it was essential 
  that the results gathered and analysed by the research maintain a statistical 
  reliability (<a href="#neu03">Neuman, 2003</a>).</p>
<h3>Vocabulary review</h3>
<p> Some statements within the new instrument were altered to give an Australian
  lexis perspective and to ensure that the comprehension of the statements were
not distorted so that they could be easily understood by the participants.</p>
<p>  To fit into an Australian University level educational environment, words
  like teacher or instructor were replaced with the word lecturer; the word school
was replaced by the word University, etc.</p>
<p>Other statements required more than
  single word changes e.g. the statement &#8220;People
  who challenge authority are over-confident&#8221; was replaced with &#8220;People
  who challenge authority come across as a bit full of themselves&#8221;. This
  form of wording would relate more comfortably to Australian students and allow
them to comprehend the underlying context of the statement.</p>
<p>However other statements
  were introduced to actively scope of the participant&#8217;s
  comprehension e.g. &#8220;Events from the past do not influence events in the
  future&#8221;. This statement was designed to explore the student&#8217;s belief
  toward whether or not they viewed knowledge as conditional, and would they
  expect knowledge to be certain or changeable &#8211; implying contextually
alterable knowledge.</p>
<h3>EBS acceptance</h3>
<p>To warrant an easier acceptance of the EBS by both staff and students, and
  ensure a good percentage of responses, the survey was distributed during the
  participants&#8217; first
orientation lecture at the University.</p>
<p> This was acceptable on two points;<br />
  (1) Less time to overtly think about the statements by the participants would
  produce more significant levels of first response answers and <br />
(2) It would also allow the instrument to be distributed, answered, and collected
easily within the first fifteen minutes of the participant&#8217;s first lecture
of semester one while the lecturer was concurrently completing other initial
administration tasks. </p>
<p>This strategy enabled a response return rate of 84.4% to be achieved for this
  study.</p>
<h3>Participant demographics</h3>
<p>From a total of four hundred and thirty five (435) student responses received,
  one hundred and sixty six (166) were male, and two hundred and sixty nine (269)
  were female - see table 1. Participant demographics</p>

<p>Students from four broad content domains participated in this study, the four
  domains being, Computing, Information Systems, Nursing and Health students.</p>
<h4>Maintaining a measurable indicator</h4>
<p> As this researcher&#8217;s initial intention was a confirmatory analysis of 
  the epistemological beliefs held by first year university level students, it 
  was considered necessary that the demographics of the participants also conformed 
  as closely as possible to the original EQ 1990 test group as stated in Schommer-Aikins 
  (<a href="#sch90">1990</a>).</p>
<h3>The EBS design</h3>
<p> After extensive study and examination of the research literature, two of
  the original Schommer-Aikins pre-defined twelve subsets appeared to have negligible
  effect on the study (see Table 2: Statement allocation).</p>
<p> In Schommer-Aikins&#8217;s original results, Concentrated Effort had the smallest 
  loading coefficient value (0.09552), and Cant&#8217; learn how to learn&#8221; 
  posed statements that most learner&#8217;s would not have had the experience 
  or ability to answer with any measure of confidence or understanding (<a href="#dix00">Dixon, 
  2000</a>). Both these subsets were consequently discarded.</p>
<p> Some researchers had also argued that some of the statements in the original 
  Schommer-Aikins study may not have necessarily fulfilled the needs of the research 
  initially proposed within the original data analysis (<a href="#schr02">Schraw 
  and Bendixen et al., 2002</a>).</p>
<p>Other researchers reached similar conclusions when attempting to recreate the 
  results based on the Schommer-Aikins instrument, or even during their efforts 
  to modify the original EQ survey instrument <a href="#jhe93">(Jheng and Johnson 
  et al., 1993</a>, <a href="#hal96">Hall and Chiarello et al., 1996</a>, <a href="#tol02">Tolhurst 
  and Debus, 2002</a>).</p>
<p> The number of statements within each subset also seemed excessive, as several
  of the original Schommer-Aikins statements appeared to be only reworked versions
  of other similar statements within her study.</p>
<p> After applying the Australian perspective to the original statements and
  removing those statements considered redundant to the designs of the study,
  additional
  statements were added in an attempt to redress any imbalance.</p>
<p> The statements that were finally selected for inclusion in the EBS were also
  objectively balanced to ensure that the valence use within each subset closely
  mirrored the percentage of negative valence to positive valence found in the
  original Schommer-Aikins instrument (27(-), 36(+), (75%)) as compared to the
  EBS (15(-), 19(+), (78%)).</p>

<p>  Table 2: Statement allocations, illustrates the differences in statement
  distribution between the Schommer-Aikins instrument and the EBS instrument
  proposed in this
research</p>
<p> From this breakdown of the statement allocation; it can be seen that all
  subsets deemed to be critical within the original EQ instrument, are well represented.
  Detailed analysis of the gathered responses from the participants using EBS
  confirmed that this particular statement distribution matrix proved satisfactory.
  A full
list of the statements used in the EBS can be found in Annex A.</p>
<h2>Research methodology</h2>
<p> This project is a phenomenological case study utilising quantitative research
  methods to gain an understanding of the epistemological beliefs of a group
of new undergraduate university students.</p>
<h3>Phenomenology</h3>
<p> Phenomenology is the study of &quot;phenomena&quot;: appearances of things,
  or things as they appear in our experience, or the ways we experience things,
  thus
the meanings things have in our experience.</p>
<p> We all experience various types of experience including perception, imagination, 
  thought, emotion, desire, volition, and action (<a href="#">Woodruff-Smith, 
  2003</a>). This axiom that people experience the world in different ways ideally 
  suited the requirements of this study.</p>
<h3>Justification for using the case study methodology</h3>
<p> Benbasat et al (<a href="#ben87">1987</a>) state that case research is suitable 
  for studies that are in early or formative stages or where the experiences of 
  the subjects are important and the context within which they operate is vital. 
  The case study approach can be helpful in identifying and exploring areas for 
  further research and aiding hypothesis generation (<a href="#car98">Carroll 
  and Daeson et al., 1998</a>). This corresponds to the particular area under 
  investigation.</p>
<h3>Reliability and validity</h3>
<p> Any interpreted qualification of data has been based on quantitatively collected
  data from participants involved with the study and should be recognisable as
being both conceivable and verifiable by readers of the research.</p>
<p> A facet of validity relates to the generalisation of research findings, the
  result of this research was produced from a relatively large sample population.
  <br />
  Therefore it is suggested that the findings presented are repeatable and valid
within the context discussed.</p>
<h2>Confirmatory replication analysis</h2>
<p> The gathered data was initially entered into an MS Excel spreadsheet, which
  allowed quick calculation of the mean responses for each question by the participants.
  <br />
  Since approximately half of the statements were worded so that a na&iuml;ve
  individual would simply agree with them and the other half were worded so that
  the na&iuml;ve
  individual would simply disagree with them, some of the statements need to
be recoded.</p>
<p> Factor analysis is based on the assumption that the higher the score, the
  more na&iuml;ve the individual. So, all statements that a na&iuml;ve individual
  would disagree with needed to be changed, for example if the participant responded
  with a four (4) to a question with a negative valence (-) then this would have
  to be recoded to a two (2), see Annex A: EBS Statement structure for all valence
relations.</p>
<p>Finally the subset averages for each statement were amalgamated into
a final table ready for the factor analysis stage.</p>
<h3>Factor analysis</h3>
<p> The recoded subset data was entered into the application; Statistical Package
  for the Social Sciences v12.0.1 (SPSS) and a factor analysis conducted using
  Varimax rotation. From the detailed readout provided by this application a
  definitive comparison was able to be made as to the suitability of the data
  for such an
  analysis, as well as favourable comparison to the original Schommer-Aikins
(1990) sample group.</p>
<h4>Statistical validity</h4>
<p> Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of Sampling Adequacy is a measure of whether or
  not the distribution of values is adequate for conducting factor analysis.
  A measure
  of &gt;0.9 is marvellous, &gt;0.8 is meritorious, &gt;0.7 is middling, &gt; 0.6
  is mediocre, &gt; 0.5 is miserable and &lt; 0.5 is unacceptable. The data returned
a value sampling adequacy of 0.768 which is middling, almost meritorious.</p>
<p>Bartlett&#8217;s
  test of Sphericity is a measure of the multivariate normality of the set of
  distributions. It also tests whether the correlation matrix conducted
  within the factor analysis is an identity matrix. Factor analysis would be
  meaningless with an identity matrix. A significance value &lt; 0.05 indicates
  that the data do NOT produce an identity matrix and are thus approximately
  multivariate
  normal
  and acceptable for factor analysis (George and Mallery, 2003). The data within
  this study returned a significance value of 0.000, indicating that the data
was acceptable for factor analysis.</p>
<p>Cronbach&#8217;s alpha calculated by SPSS
for this investigation was 0.696, and deemed acceptable.</p>
<h4>Factor extraction</h4>
<p> After the Eigenvalues for each subset were plotted on a bicoordinate plane
  to establish the number of significant components, the solution was then rotated
  to enhance the view of the results. There were four significant components extracted
  during the analysis that had maintained an acceptable Eigenvalue greater than
  or equal to 1.0. <br />
  These four extracted components comprised a total of 61.083% of the data analysed,
  see figure: 1 Component Plot.<br />
  This is the same number of postulated factors that Schommer-Aikins had produced,
  and suggests that the EBS should be able to successfully produce similar results.

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 1: Component plot in rotated space</strong></div>
<h4>Component score coefficient matrix</h4>
<p>  Having accepted the rotated plot of the data, a component score coefficient
  matrix was generated to show how the pre-defined subgroups of statements had
  loaded
  within their respective factors. This also allowed a more direct comparison
with the original Schommer-Aikins results.</p>
<p> Table 3: Confirmatory Coefficient Matrix, illustrates the distribution of
  subset to factor relationships. All EBS factors loaded significantly higher
  than the
  results
recorded in the original EQ study.</p>

<h2>Results and evaluations of the confirmatory analysis</h2>
<p>  When the subset loadings were considered in relation to their groupings, the
four factors began to take on a similarity to those proposed by Schommer-Aikins.</p>
<p><strong>Factor 1</strong>: Simple Knowledge<br />
  &#8226; SS1: Seek single answers<br />
  &#8226; SS3: Avoid ambiguity<br />
&#8226; SS4: Knowledge is certain</p>
<p> <strong>Factor 2:</strong> Quick Learning<br />
  &#8226; SS8: Learn the first time<br />
&#8226; SS9: Learning is quick</p>
<p> <strong>Factor 3:</strong> Fixed Ability<br />
  &#8226; SS7: Ability to learn is innate<br />
&#8226; SS10: Success is unrelated to hard work</p>
<p><strong>Factor 4:</strong> Omniscient Authority<br />
  &#8226; SS2: Avoid integration<br />
  &#8226; SS5: Depend on authority<br />
&#8226;
  SS6: Don&#8217;t criticize authority</p>
<p> The subset grouping appeared to be more similar in nature to the Omniscient 
  Authority factor initially proposed by Schommer-Aikins and further discussed 
  by Shraw et al. (<a href="#shr02">2002</a>) in their research into the development 
  of the Epistemic Beliefs Index (EBI) (<a href="#schr02">Schraw and Bendixen 
  et al., 2002</a>).</p>
<h3>Epistemic belief structures</h3>
<p> The results revealed by the EBS showed that by using the pre-defined subset
      groupings proposed by Schommer-Aikins it was possible to reproduce a four
      factor belief
      structure. While these factors may differ slightly from the original EQ
      study, this is not surprising given the difference in chronology and changed
      social
      attitudes, let alone the difference in geographical locale.</p>
<p> The results did show a clear belief structure of the participants. They
      believe that questions posed to them during their studies required simple
      unambiguous
      answers (facts) and this information would rarely alter. This is seen to
      be driven by the need to find the answer that would gain the most favourable
      assessment,
      not necessarily the correct answer.</p>
<p>  They also expressed a belief that the information should be easy to learn
      or else they would struggle to comprehend it.
  The belief, uniform across all studies, that some individuals have innate
      talent and learning comes easy to them, was also clearly expressed. </p>
<p> Finally, the dependence on a belief that information and knowledge handed
      down from their lecturer or educator should be accepted and preserved with
      minor
      or no integration with previously experienced knowledge.</p>
<h2>Exploratory analysis</h2>
<p> To further test the EBS to see if it was capable of producing interpretable 
  results, the original 34 statements were re-analysed by the SPSS application 
  and then analysed again based on the naturally forming subsets found in the 
  original pass. This has never been reported by Schommer-Aikins as having been 
  done before during her study. <br />
  It is not uncommon for a data set to be subjected to a series of factor analysis 
  and rotation before the obtained factors can be considered &#8220;clean&#8221; 
  and interpretable (<a href="#ho00">Ho, 2000</a>).</p>
<h3>First exploratory analysis</h3>
<p> The first unrestricted analysis of the data was conducted exactly as the
      confirmatory analysis using all the data ungrouped as opposed to predefined
      subsets. This
      produced eleven (11) discernibly different possible subsets. See Table
      4: Factor loadings.</p>

<p>  Subsets were now formed using those loadings illustrated in table 4 and
      again analysed by the SPSS application and the output scrutinized to see
      if the
EBS instrument could provide interpretable results.</p>
<h4>First pass statistical validity</h4>
<p> Within the first pass of the exploratory analysis the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
      measure of Sampling Adequacy was calculated to be 0.768. Bartlett&#8217;s
      test of Sphericity was measured to be 0.000. Cronbach&#8217;s alpha was
calculated to be 0.744.</p>
<p> These eleven factors explained a total of 53.50% of the analysis.</p>
<h3>Second exploratory analysis</h3>
<p>  The newly formed subset data was the processed and analysed, with the output
      revealing that the eleven subsets loaded onto four factors, see Table 5:
Exploratory Coefficient Matrix.</p>
<p> Factor 1: Fixed ability (1, 2 and 9)<br />
  Factor 2: Simple knowledge (5, 6 and 7)<br />
  Factor 3: Quick learning (3, 8 and 10)<br />
  Factor 4: Omniscient authority (4 and 11)</p>
<p>The certain knowledge factor described by Schommer-Aikins (1990) appears
  to load within the simple knowledge belief for this study&#8217;s participants.</p>

<h4>Second pass statistical validity</h4>
<p>  Within the second pass of the exploratory analysis the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
      measure of Sampling Adequacy was calculated to be 0.740. Bartlett&#8217;s
      test of Sphericity was measured to be 0.000. Cronbach&#8217;s alpha was
calculated to be 0.641.</p>
<p> These four extracted factors explained a total of 54.22% of the second
analysis.</p>
<h2> Conclusions and recommendations </h2>
<p> The beliefs demonstrated by the participants of this study clearly indicate
      that the vast majority are still at the immature dualistic thinking level.
      Also the
      beliefs that successful students comprise an innate ability combined with
      an even firmer belief that problem and questions posited by higher level
      educators
      during lectures and tutorials have clearly defined simple answers that
the learner need only memorize and regurgitate at a later date during assessment.</p>
<p>The
  participants also exhibited an obvious need to maintain a guiding or directing
  authority figure that will supply factual information in an attempt
      to preserve
their comfort zone in the new educational environment.</p>
<p>Within the scope
  of a broader research project on understanding knowledge genesis and methodologies
  of improving personal literacy, the development
      and construction
      of an instrument capable of indicating a naissance framework of learners
      epistemological belief structures, presents a sound preliminary point of
      reference that provides
      valuable insight toward understanding how learners view, evaluate, and
construct knowledge.</p>
<p>  The statistical information provided by the factor analysis used in this
      study proves that the EBS is capable of tentatively elucidating epistemological
      beliefs
from participants.</p>
<p>The initial epistemological belief structures containing
  perceptions such as the beliefs uncovered within this study can now be identified
  and isolated.
      These ideals may then be compared, allowing contrasts and variances to
      be observed
illustrating trends and changes of attitude within those beliefs.</p>
<p> It is widely acknowledged that Schommer-Aikins (<a href="#sch90">1990</a>) 
  work is seminal in the understanding of epistemological beliefs, but given the 
  arguments uncovered in the literature and throughout the developmental work 
  on the EBS, consideration needs to be given toward construction of better methods 
  of gathering these sensitive views of learners.</p>
<p> While the actual factor loadings did not mirror the original results reported 
  in Schommer-Aikins (<a href="#sch90">1990</a>), the obvious similarity of factor 
  loading between the EQ and the EBS demonstrates that the theories behind personal 
  epistemological beliefs can be considered reliable and reproducible.</p>
<p>  Previous research into other literary articles along similar lines of discussion
      by noted experts such as Paul Pintrich, Barbara Hofer, Marcia Baxter Magolda,
      Gregory Shraw, Denise Tolhurst and Phillip Wood, has convinced this researcher
      that the EBS instrument constructed for this study is an enabling tool
      that is capable of gathering conceptual information that can be reproduced
      in
      a form
      that gives educators and researchers an insight into the development of
theories within the field of personal epistemological belief structures.</p>
<p>  Although the development, completion and future online use of the EBS instrument
      will help alleviate the problems of lengthy administration and scoring
      time, it is important to remember that it is still being developed by this
researcher.</p>
<h2>Educational implications</h2>
<p>  The role of epistemological beliefs is subtle, yet ubiquitous. These beliefs
      do influence how students learn, how teachers instruct, and subsequently
      how teachers knowingly or unknowingly modify their students&#8217; epistemological
beliefs.</p>
<p> Epistemological belief structures affect how the learner controls their information 
  needs and the processes used when accepting new evidence as relevant or superfluous. 
  This idea of information relevance and cognitive development based on pre-understandings 
  is a fundamental concept in learner development as well as Information Science 
  and (<a href="#hjo00">Hjorland, 2000</a>). </p>
<p> Evidence is also accumulating to support the notion that the student&#8217;s 
  epistemological beliefs play an important role in their learning. The &#8220;Theory 
  theory&#8221; also proposes that there are powerful cognitive processes that 
  revise existing theories or beliefs in response to new evidence (<a href="#gop97">Gopnik 
  and Meltzoff, 1997</a>). For example, various studies indicate that the more 
  students believe in certain knowledge, the more likely they are to draw absolute 
  conclusions from tentative text. The more students believe in fixed ability, 
  simple knowledge, and quick learning, the more likely they are to display lower 
  levels of reflective judgment. The more students believe in quick learning, 
  the more likely they are to comprehend text poorly or earn lower grade point 
  averages. The more students believe in fixed ability, the less likely they are 
  to value schooling or persist on difficult academic tasks. </p>
<p>  If educators can ascertain individual students&#8217; epistemological beliefs
      by comparison to group norms, they can adapt instruction to guide lower
      achieving students into higher level thinking, and conversely, they can
      adapt instruction
for higher achieving students to assist their growth.</p>
<p>  Understanding how humans create and develop personal knowledge is also
  of significant interest to AI project development.</p>

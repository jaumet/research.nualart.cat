  <meta name="dc.subject" content="Abstract: The present article introduces a type of action research, which is inspired by Modus 2 knowledge production-driven cooperation between theorists and practitioners within the LIS community. The aim is to consider the role of libraries in along with their adaptation to the knowledge society. A perusal and analysis of the literature concerned with scenario planning and Modus 2 knowledge production has led to the development of a model for action research. Three minor investigations/experiments have been carried out that allowed for testing the central assumptions formulated for the present study in practical settings. The notion of strategic reflexive conversation emerges as a major theoretical construct refined in the context of the present study. Concretely, a strategy/method/technique/tool to assist library development in the knowledge society was fleshed out here. Another result is an improved understanding of theoretical library development in relation to practice viewed from the perspective of strategic reflexive conversation. The strategy can with advantage be applied to library development and library policy formulation in practical settings and not least within the process of observing and reacting to current developments in the surrounding society &#8211; the knowledge society. Besides, the strategy can be applied in assessing planned library development projects and activities along with those in progress. The applications of the strategy are reported in the article." />

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Recent and current developments in society, the transformation from an
industrial society or an information society to a knowledge society, bring about
a pressure for change in public libraries that are discernible not least in the
way the libraries&#8217; users or clients behave nowadays. The population at large
tends to develop more and more sophisticated competences in personal information
handling/processing and knowledge management/dispensation. The widespread
information and knowledge literacy among citizens challenge the traditional
competences possessed by libraries and librarians in these areas. In the
following, these developments are examined in greater detail and an attempt is
made to estimate effects and implications. </p>
<p>
The principal focus of this article is on how libraries can tackle this
challenge by joining efforts with the research world and by reliance on action
research. Consideration is given to the potential of a scientific research
method that is capable of producing new knowledge as a result of an active
interplay between researchers and library practitioners. The subject field
addressed by the analysis is library development in the knowledge society. It is
about the axiom of how library development can progress both in
theory and in practice in the knowledge society. The assumption is that library
development can be initiated through the thinking underlying and the techniques
related to scenario planning. The starting point of the analysis is scenario
planning. The aim of the project is to carry out a strategic reflexive conversation
conducted as action research.</p>
<p>
The present article is structured as follows: First, I will attempt to determine
those aspects of the knowledge society that are particularly relevant to
libraries and identify some critical challenges coming up in these years and to
be faced by libraries and librarians. Second, I intend concretizing and
elaborating on how I imagine that the above challenges can be tackled through a
type of action research, which derives its inspiration from scenario planning
and Modus 2 knowledge production. After having briefly discussed the relevant
elements of scenario planning I will move on to introducing the concept of
strategic reflexive conversation. Third, I will attempt to substantiate and
elucidate how strategic reflexive conversation can be applied as a tool for
library development both theoretically and in practice and supported by evidence
produced by three concrete action research-driven experiments undertaken in the
years 2005 and 2006. Finally, I will evaluate the concrete results and take a
self-critical approach to the findings of my research study and its methodology.</p>
<h2>The Challenges Facing Libraries and Librarians in the Knowledge Society&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In these years, public libraries are experiencing a cross-pressure situation. No
doubt the cause of the current pressure can be ascribed to the general
developments in society that generate new conditions and cause changes of
traditional societal agencies such as universities, secondary schools, primary
schools and public libraries. Briefly, the development witnessed can be
described as a process that implies the transformation from an industrial and
information based society into a knowledge society at the dawn of the 21st century
that is characterised by the rise and development of knowledge-based economy
where rapid learning and knowledge production develops into the decisive
competition parameter (cf. Gibbons <em>et al.</em><a href="#gib94">1994</a>,
Castells <a href="#cas00">2000</a>, Nowotny et al. <a href="#now01">2001</a>,
Regeringen <a href="#reg06">2006</a>). Characteristic to the development progressing in that
direction is that citizens tend to develop more and more sophisticated
competences for handling information and knowledge both in relation to work life,
privacy and other matters. The informational and knowledge-related competences
of the citizens are being strengthened partly through a general increase of the
educational level of the population and partly concurrently with the general
spread of information and communication technologies and the increased social
accessibility to these technologies. It means that citizens are increasingly
becoming capable of making use of and manipulating information and knowledge
resources on their own in a variety of organisational environments with the
effect that libraries are more and more being bypassed. In other words, users
change behaviour. Another consequence can be that users
of libraries will present more demanding reference questions. Public libraries
and public librarians themselves express that they feel pressured with regard to
their traditional library professional competences according to information and
knowledge. This observation is corrobated by three action research studies. For
more details about this see the last part of the article. </p>
<p>
Add to this the acuteness of the information overload problem. A special
challenge arises when and if users expect that the librarian, in a qualified
manner, is able to identify and refer to home pages on the Internet about any
topic. In previous pieces, I/we have argued that, from the perspective of the
individual library, the concepts of library collection and collection
development do not make sense any longer in the same way as previously. A
concept that can facilitate an understanding of the new situation is the
extended notion of the library&#8217;s collection: &#8221;the boundless collection&#8221; cf.
Enemærke &amp; Kristiansson (<a href="#ene04">2004</a>) or &#8221;the unlimited collection&#8221;. The expression of
&#8221;the unlimited collection&#8221; implies a shift away from local library stocks and
self-supply, i.e. the collections possessed by the individual libraries, and
toward the existence and availability of the total materials production. The
evident thing is that, viewed in this kind of perspective, librarians are facing
difficulty in keeping abreast of the development and rightly may feel pressured.
It seems that managing the &#8220;unlimited collection&#8221; calls for a new kind of
library thinking and library policy that identifies and incorporates changes
observed in users&#8217; needs and behaviour.</p>
<p>
Add to this the probability that, in the knowledge society, libraries will be
confronting competitors that actually threaten the legitimacy of the library.
Current web trends including, for instance, the development of globally
penetrating innovative services such as Google and the advent of the Wikipedia
phenomenon to be understood here in the sense of a self-organising quality
control mechanism.</p>
<h2>How can the challenge be tackled?</h2>
<h3>Action research</h3>
<p>Action research is a scientific research method that produces new knowledge in
an active interplay between researchers and practitioners. This
knowledge-generation cycle is kept going, realising that there is a relationship
between recognition and change processes and between theory and practice. There
are several action research variants. In this context, action research is
understood as a process, which aims to enhance and change the organisational
practice including the strategies, practice and knowledge on the surroundings of
the organisation. Action research is not only about a category of research that
aims to describe how employees and corporate environments act in relation to
their surrounding world, but this type of research also serves as a change
mechanism, which supports the employees and the organisation in reflecting on
and changing their systems (Reason &amp; Bradbury, <a href="#rea06">2006</a>). It is all about reforming
the existing organisational practice. The research process takes place as an
equal relation between the researcher and the practitioner with the intention to
enhancing both practice and theory. Action research is directed towards the
present and towards the future whereas it rarely refers back to the past. </p>
<p>
The study reported here considers library development at the organisational
level. The study addresses the common issue about how library development can be
undertaken on the premises of the knowledge society in a theoretical context and
in practice. Library development should be understood here in the sense of
something proactive: the development of a practice designed to prepare the
library for keeping up with the rapid and unpredictable changes characterising
the knowledge society. The topic to be researched here is library development
with focus on the development of a pragmatic method/technique than is applicable
to library development and which stands out as robust in terms of volatility and
unpredictability. </p>
<p>
The starting point of the analysis is scenario planning as a field of
practice and the theoretical foundation relied on is discourse theory
and constructivism that are fields of practice and scientific
disciplines outside LIS, but in this context they are applied or
related to the LIS field. The assumption is that library development
can be initiated by means of the body of thinking and the techniques
drawn upon in scenario planning because scenario planning has proved an
appropriate tool in strategic management focusing on the challenges of
the knowledge society. The philosophy underlying scenario planning is
that in situations characterised by volatility and unpredictability
nothing is necessarily left to chance &#8211; contingencies are not always
the ruling factor &#8211; but you have a possibility of influencing the
future development and thereby survive as organisation or library by
reliance on innovation and new thinking. The conclusion of the paper is
that the scenario approach is capable of generating new thinking at the
organisational level in libraries through strategic reflexive
conversation. This organisational process offers a conceptual framework
rooted in discourse theory and constructivism. Strategic reflexive
conversation has two different functions in relation to action research
and should according to this be understood in two different senses: 1)
a strategy/technique/method/tool for library development in practice
and 2) a conceptual framework; scenario planning placed in a
discourse-theoretical in a Modus 2 perspective.</p>
<p>
In the subsequent section arguments are presented in support of the view that
scenario planning can with advantage be relied on to as an accompanying tool in
the context of action research. Also, arguments are presented to explain the
preconditions, which should be tested. In the following section, the central
elements are identified and explained; how the scenario technique can concretely
be used in action research. In the section that follows after this account the
intellectual and theoretical foundation for the scenario technique applied as
action research is presented and fleshed out as a conceptual framework termed
strategic reflexive conversation. Subsequently, the methodology and tree concrete action research
projects conducted in 2005 and 2006 are presented. This presentation is followed
by a section, which discusses and assesses how the results of the action
research processes can be converted into development of practical library and
information based activities.</p>

<h3>Scenario planning compared to action research</h3>

<p>The origin of scenario planning as a tool can probably be traced back to
military environments many decades ago and since then the scenario approach has
been applied to quite a few purposes. In addition, a wide variety of variants
exist, cf. Bradfield et al. (<a href="#bra05">2005</a>), which will not be considered here. The type
of scenario planning to be addressed in this paper is the version, which was
originally developed by the Royal Dutch/Shell group in the early 1970s in
connection with strategic management. Central titles are: Wack (<a href="#wac85a">1985a</a>,<a href="#wac85b">b</a>), de
Geus (<a href="#deg88">1988</a>), Schwartz (<a href="#sch91">1991</a>) and van der Heijden (<a href="#van96">1996</a>) as well as Schoemaker
(<a href="#sch92">1992</a>, <a href="#sch93">1993</a>, <a href="#sch95">1995</a>), Kleiner (<a href="#kle96">1996</a>) and de Geus (<a href="#deg97">1997</a>).
For action research and scenario planning cf. Chermack (<a href="#che07">2007</a>)
and cf. Argyris et al. (<a href="#arg85">1985</a>) .</p>
<p>
Strategic management should be understood as follows: development of a strategic
mind, strategy formulation, long-term planning and organisational development.
Scenario planning is presented as a special paradigm within strategic management
&#8211; the processual paradigm, which constitutes an alternative to the &#8221;the
rationalist and evolutionary paradigm&#8221; (cf. van der Heijden
<a href="#van05">2005</a>: 21-50) &#8211; which,
in contrast to the other two versions or paradigms is particularly suitable in
attempting to come to grips with volatility, complexity and unpredictability.
Scenario planning especially lends itself to the creation of organisational
readiness so as to prevent that turbulence and unexpected developments in the
surrounding context of the organisation take management and employees by
surprise. The objective is to develop a collective proactive mind plus an
awareness of the necessity of punctual care in scanning, studying and reacting
to the organisation&#8217;s environment, to be watchful of the things to come as well
as to provide the preconditions that allow the organisation &#8211; or library &#8211; to
provide the optimal response just in time. This set of requirements can be
defined as &#8221;strategic learning&#8221; and in this context the function to be performed
by scenario planning is: 1) evaluation and selection of strategies; 2)
integration of various kinds of future-oriented data; 3) exploration of the
future and identification of future possibilities; 4) making managers aware of
environmental uncertainties; 5) stretching of managers&#8217; mental models; 6)
triggering and acceleration processes of organisational learning (Bood &amp; Postma
<a href="#boo97">1997</a>). However, the scenario method or technique, per se, lends itself to
application in many other contexts and for other purposes: reflexivity,
creativity, innovation, knowledge production and to testing of decisions, plans
and visions, cf. Chermack &amp; van der Merwe, (<a href="#che03">2003</a>) who argue for &#8220;the role of
constructivist learning in scenario planning&#8221;. Moreover, scenario planning can
be thought of as a system facilitating the creating knowledge and the
stimulation of learning; externalization and internalization cf. Choo, (<a href="#cho98">1998</a>:
20-25). Thus, it appears obvious to consider the relevance of and making use of
scenario planning as a natural vehicle and starting point in library development
and policy.</p>
<p>
Based on the above observations, the postulate to be made here is that scenario
planning also presents itself as an ideal tool in action research. The
prerequisite is that the scenario technique is capable of generating new
knowledge and producing new thinking in an active interplay between researchers
and practitioners. The intention is to substantiate that the scenario technique
constitutes a pragmatic method which allows practitioners and researchers to
jointly discuss, reflect on library development and library policy
in the knowledge society for the purpose of reforming the existing practice at
the organisational level including the strategies, practice and knowledge on the
library&#8217;s surrounding environment. Moreover, the scenario process should take
place as a balanced interaction between researchers and participants. The
intellectual and theoretical foundation for scenario planning and techniques
should be identified and presented. The end product emerging from the action
research processes should be a conceptual framework that facilitates discussion
of, reflections on and exploring library developments in theory and practice: to
confront the vital issue of the role of libraries in the knowledge society and
how libraries can adapt themselves to the conditions and challenges of this type
of society.</p>
<h3>The scenario technique conceived as action research</h3>

<p>Scenario planning designed or orchestrated as an action research process
includes workshops where participants discuss library development with focus on
strategies, practice and knowledge about the library&#8217;s surroundings. The
researcher serves as meeting or discussion leader and as such he or she does not
get directly involved in the discussion and in this sense the researcher is a
neutral person. </p>
<p>
A scenario workshop runs as a structured group-based conversational process
addressing a pre-defined theme and the process is that it is open, democratic
and ends up in consensus. The scenario technique both applies the induction and
the deduction principle in relation to information and knowledge generation (cf.
Van der Heijden <a href="#van05">2005</a>: 236-251). The discussion opens up, progresses, is being
maintained, kept on the track and made visible &#8211; &#8221;externalized&#8221; &#8211; for instance
by use of post-it slips that are placed on a wall. The discussion becomes
&#8221;internalised&#8221; among participants when they jointly, and acting in concert,
cluster and structure the slips and the label the clusters; induction. Based on
an agreed framework, concrete scenario stories are extracted: deduction.
Together, the scenario processes develop a common frame of understanding and a
mutual &#8220;in-house&#8221; language capability, a collective language resource that
facilitates communication on complex matters among participants and which
creates a mental and language-specific sturdiness that can be draw upon in
mastering a given library development project. Through consensus knowledge about
the surroundings are transformed into organisational knowledge and a sense of
joint action in relation to the library development project is brought about.
This is achieved by refining and repeating the scenario stories (Choo,
<a href="#cho98">1998</a>, s.
22).</p>
<p>
However, the process is disturbed by the researcher (the chairman of the
meeting). The chairman keeps on putting questions not to receive answers, but in
order to create reflection and new thinking. The participants consider the
development of the library&#8217;s macro context &#8211; the knowledge society &#8211; by being
challenged by the leader of this social process (the researcher) and in this way
they are forced to systematically reflect on the basis of their own and their
fellow participants&#8217; observations and communication on the outer world of the
library. The leader of the meeting (the researcher) takes a critical stand
towards the participant&#8217;s mental models. In scenario planning it is assumed that
mental models and basic assumptions in the end determine practice, planning and
decisions. Thus, the essential thing here is to challenge participants&#8217; existing
mental models. The chairman of the meeting critically assesses statements that
represent truisms and clichés, forecasts, prognoses and predictions. On the
contrary, the meeting leader (the researcher) encourages participants to direct
their attention to that which is uncertain, unpredictable and unknown; that
which we don&#8217;t know that we don&#8217;t know. In this way, participants obtain a sort
of experience as regards the unknown. The meeting leader further encourages
participants to deal with complex, obscure and ambiguous information and
knowledge. This is a way of creating a mental frankness, sensitivity and
responsiveness among the participants in relation to contingencies. Besides, the
meeting leader encourages participants to consider future as an influencable
phenomenon. This is a way to ensure that participants &#8211; individually and jointly
&#8211; get a feeling of being in a position to influence the future development of
the library.</p>
<p>
The optimum outcome is when participants achieve a common frame of understanding
and develop a joint language focused on the library and allowing them to express
themselves about the library&#8217;s situation, the interrelatedness between the
library and its physical and social environs along with the current developments
affecting these environs. This interrelatedness and the constant changes
observable in these environs constitute the relevant basis for library
development and policy. A joint situation-specific vocabulary at the same time
lays the foundation for continued discussion, reflections and development of the
project within an organisational framework.</p>

<h2>Strategic reflexive conversation</h2>
<p>The intention behind the present article is, among other things, that the
conceptual framework termed strategic reflexive conversation should help provide
a theoretical understanding of how the scenario technique functions in practice
and in connection with action research. Strategic reflexive conversation
constitutes the theoretical basis of the paper drawing upon the theoretical work
presented in Gaml &amp; Kristiansson (<a href="#gam06">2006</a>). But strategic reflexive conversation at
the same time constitutes the theoretical and pragmatic findings of the study
reported in the present paper in that the conceptual framework has been made
more robust; achieved by juxtaposing the conceptual framework and
action research. The term strategic conversation relates to scenario planning in
the sense of van der Heijden (<a href="#van96">1996</a>, <a href="#van05">2005</a>). Strategic conversation is dealt with
by van der Heijden, but it is not explored and expanded to a degree one could
rightly expect given the fact that the term is included in the book&#8217;s subtitle.
Hence, one could, with advantage, elaborate the concept by incorporating it into
a discourse-theoretical conceptual framework and this is the ambition in next
section. The titles within discourse theory that are drawn upon in the next
section of the article are: Laclau &amp; Mouffe (<a href="#lac85">1985</a>), Laclau (<a href="#lac90">1990</a>), Torfing
(<a href="#tor99">1999</a>) and Hansen (<a href="#han05">2005</a>) as well as Kristiansson (<a href="#kri05">2005</a>).</p>
<h3>Strategic conversation in a discourse-theoretical perspective</h3>
<p>In a discourse-theoretical sense, strategic conversation can be viewed as a
communicative process, which represents a language-specific change that is
introduced in an organisational context. In introducing this language-specific
change, the point is that the strategic language should be changed and developed
in a way so that it will affect decisions, actions and relations in an
advantageous strategic direction. This way of reasoning is based on an idea that
a relationship exists between language, thought and action. Strategic
conversation has an effect similar to that of a language-related intervention
and intervenes into the strategic language of the group/organisation. Strategic
conversation in a discourse-theoretical context is about managing a scenario
process along with challenging and reforming participants&#8217; mutual &#8220;in-house&#8221;
language capability in terms of strategy and with a view to changing
participants&#8217; mental models. </p>
<p>
Seen in a discourse-theoretical perspective, strategic conversation can be
considered a discursive intervention directed towards an already existing
conversational practice with focus on strategy such as library development and
library policy. Thus, an established conversational practice constitutes a
so-called totality of semantic relations which together create a more or less
cohesive framework for what can be said and done in relation to the project.
Therefore, strategic conversation can be considered a discursive strategy in
relation to an existing way of addressing e.g. practice; an attempt to supplant
the ruling conversational practice and to establish a new conversational
practice. As can be expected, discursive intervention occasions a so-called
discursive dispute between two approaches to speaking about, for instance,
practice with the matter in dispute being the semantic value to be ascribed to
the words. Discursive intervention takes place via a process, which is here
termed deconstruction and it is defined as a process, which reveals how an
apparently unbreakable meaningfulness on, for example, practice can be viewed as
a construction of historically and culturally conditioned elements that are
arbitrarily composed.</p>
<h3>Strategic reflexive conversation &#8211; a conceptual framework</h3>
<p>This section includes a presentation of the overall conceptual framework that
constitutes the theoretical basis and the platform for the type action research
inspired by Modus 2 knowledge production (Gibbons <em>et al.</em>, <a href="#gib94">1994</a>; Nowotny <em>et al.,</em>
<a href="#now01">2001</a>), which is discussed in the present article cf. Gaml &amp; Kristiansson (<a href="#gam06">2006</a>).</p>
<p>
The conceptual framework is labelled strategic reflexive conversation and has
three elements:</p>
<ul>
<li> Strategy and pragmatic focus
</li><li> Transdisciplinary knowledge organisation
</li><li> Strategic and reflexive conversation
</li></ul>
<h4>Strategic and pragmatic focus</h4>

<p>

Strategic reflexive conversation focuses on strategy, applications, relevance,
concrete projects and problems where the basis is the existing strategy and
practice. In this study two themes have been in focus 1) library development and
2) library practice. </p>

<h4>Transdisciplinary knowledge organisation</h4>
<p>I Modus 2, volatile transdisciplinary networks constitute the pivotal principle
in the knowledge production. Idea is to compose groups where different
expertises, bodies of knowledge and players including laymen are represented. A
composition of participants like this represents diversity and a heterogeneity,
which stretches beyond the cross- or multidisciplinary sphere, among other
things because of the presence of laymen.</p>

<h4>Strategic and reflexive conversation</h4>
<p>Reflexive conversation can be defined as a process that generates knowledge and
new thinking; production of meaning about new, wholly or partly unknown
phenomena and situations like for instance library practice. Strategic
conversation can be defined as reflexive conversation, which focuses on
strategic topics such as library development. However, the two notions are
difficult to separate since, in reality, a new conversational practice, as
applied to library practical operations and processes, will probably activate
library development and lead to a change of the library policy actually
conducted. But it should be noted that reflexive conversation does not
necessarily cause changes of the official and/or explicit library policy.</p>
<p>
Transdisciplinary knowledge organisation creates a solid basis for increasing
reflexivity. This is due to the diversity created through various heterogeneous
bodies of
expertise. Loosely composed networks per se occasion enhanced reflection
exactly because the process, the culture and the structure have not been
established beforehand; reflexivity arises when participants are jointly facing
the task of creating a &#8221;common language&#8221; and when cohesiveness within networks
has to be ensured through, for instance, the development of new values, roles
and identities for cooperation. Increased reflexivity is also the outcome when
focus is placed on topics such as development, new strategy and problems. This
is due to the fact that development, strategy and problem represent new
knowledge; the efforts to develop something new or to solve problems
automatically produce new knowledge. </p>
<p>
Finally, increased reflection is brought about when the meeting leader asks
questions and attempts to disturb the discussion with a view to creating a new
linguistic attitude to and awareness of library development and practice.
</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>The thinking underlying the action research model &#8211; strategic reflexive
conversation &#8211; has derived its inspiration from the knowledge production (Modus
2) observable within the computer industries located in the Silicon Vally area
in the 1980&#8217;s where researchers and practicing professionals were co-operating
so as to develop new IT techniques and products. The point is that you can
determine the existence of new knowledge just by observing and ascertaining that
the technique works: no additional documentation is required. Another point is
that the more contexts in which the technique or product can be embedded, the
more robust the knowledge can be said to be, which is represented by or
contained in that specific technique or product. If, for example, an information
system, in addition to functioning in a purely technical sense, is applicable to
a business-oriented and strategic context as well &#8211; in other words, if it can be
drawn upon by laymen, non-professionals, non-technicians and non-information
experts &#8211; the line of discussion increasingly points to the embeddedness of
robust knowledge in the information system in question. This is the kind of
reasoning that has been transferred to the library sector within the framework
of the present project. The assumption is that at this generalised level you
need not care very much about the fact that the public library sector on the one
hand and the computer industry on the other are two very specific fields or
lines of business that function very differently and on very dissimilar
conditions. </p>
<p>
The theme addressed by the present action research project differs from the
above Modus 2 concept. The focus is only indirectly on the development of
concrete library services or products. The intention has been to reform the
traditional discourse and the traditional consciousness of the library
practitioners as it centres on library development projects and the nature of
the subsequent practical result and deliverables are only indirectly addressed.
The object to be observed &#8211; i.e. the ontology of the study &#8211; has been the way in
which the library practicing professionals discuss library development in
relation to the projects in which they were involved. </p>
<p>
The characteristic potential of action research &#8211; that part where the researcher
mingles in with the players of the process &#8211; has been drawn upon based on the
assumption that scenario planning approached as strategic reflexive conversation
is capable of changing the traditional discourse and in this way enriches the
process and the subsequent outcome. Thus, the study has been focused solely on
discursive elements as they appear in the shape of, for instance, expressions,
models and statements. The epistemology of the study is represented by the
changes in the discursive elements throughout the process. In this context it
should be pointed out that the term discursive elements is very broadly
interpreted and that it may include physical objects as well that are
interpreted as expressions and not as objects. For instance, concrete new
library services, offerings or products can be conceived as signs and be
interpreted as a reflection of innovative thinking. </p>
<p>
The action research methodological approach adopted here is inspired by Andersen
(<a href="#and03">2003</a>) who labels his approach &#8217;analytical strategy&#8217;. Andersen (<a href="#and03">2003</a>: viii)
writes: The goal [of analytical strategy] is to question presuppositions, to
de-ontologise&#8230; [and] Which analytical strategies [as means considered] will
enable us to obtain knowledge, critically different from existing systems of
meaning?&#8221;. The strategy adopted here so as to obtain new insights in relation to
library development is called strategic reflexive conversation, which, for the
purpose of lucidity, can be divided into two entities: 1) reflexive conversation
and 2) strategic conversation. Reflexive conversation can be explained as a
critical, examining discourse on known or new phenomena with a view to attaining
a critical different view of these phenomena. In a semantic respect, Reflexive
conversation is fairly close to Andersen&#8217;s (<a href="#and03">2003</a>) concept of &#8217;analytical
strategy&#8217;. Strategic conversation &#8211; juxtaposed to scenario planning and
addressing the partly unknown terrain &#8211; can be understood as a conversation on
future phenomena and strategic topics. Strategic reflexive conversation
considers the creative, innovative and risky matters such as, for instance, the
library development in the knowledge society.</p>
<p>
In assessing the findings of the present study, the yardstick should be the
extent to which discursive changes have been effected in the wake of the action
research projects involving the library practitioners. Discursive changes imply
a new kind of language, new narratives, a new consciousness as well as new
library products and services, etc.</p>


<h3>Reflexive conversation &#8211; a strategy for analysis</h3>

<p>The investigational design &#8211; in connection with action research &#8211; developed for
the study reported in the present article is inspired by Andersen (<a href="#and03">2003)</a> and his
notion of discursive analytical strategies as opposed to a traditional
methodological framework. The point in Andersen (<a href="#and03">2003</a>) is that discursive
analytical strategies constitute a suitable approach to the conduct of social
science studies which aim to analyse changes, i.e. to expose changes to
analysis. The hypothesis is that existing concepts and categories are
insufficient when it comes to identifying changes and thereby setting up
limitations to what we can experience. This is also true of practice and
reforming of practice. It is difficult to discuss and evaluate change of
practice on the basis of the current standard and the prevailing concepts, which
are tied to a given existing practice, something that is known beforehand. It is
assumed that new conceptions are required to permit an understanding of a new
practice, which can be related to new phenomena, processes and contexts.</p>
<p>
The application of reflexive conversation in connection with action
research implies that the meeting leader (the researcher) asks questions that
are deliberately intended to disturb participants&#8217; communication structured
around the major theme and the specific topics that are focused upon in the
dialogues. The function of the questions is to allow for intervening into the
ongoing discussion for the purpose of gradually creating another linguistic
awareness and readiness in relation to the domain or topics. What the researcher
can subsequently focus his/her analysis on are those concepts/terms along with
the linguistic capability and awareness that grew out of the workshop-process,
etc., i.e. the discussion among participants. Obviously, the difficult part of
the analysis is to remedy or balance the meeting leader&#8217;s influence on the
discussion, for instance in relation to leading questions, which in a decisive
way have impacted on participants and discussion. The meeting leader should
attempt to keep as neutral as possible. The basic thing for the meeting leader is to get participants
to reflect on various familiar phenomena by approaching them from new
perspectives. The point about reflexive conversation is to move
participants&#8217; focus from the concrete practice to the way in which you speak
about practice: language but not practice is in focus. Participants&#8217; accounts
are challenged and in this way the language about e.g. practice is being
changed. Participants&#8217; stories are continuously being challenged with a view to
creating new stories. It should be pointed out that the organisational aspects
of reflexive conversation are essential. Obviously, group-based
conversations are coloured by the number and calibre of persons who participate.
This is why the composition of the group of participants is so crucial (Gaml &amp;
Kristiansson <a href="#gam06">2006</a>).</p>

<h2>Strategic reflexive conversation in practice and in connection with action
research</h2>

<p>Experience drawn from the following three research projects underlies the
present study: </p>
<ul>
<li>The good library fusion&#8221;. A merger of the libraries located in the towns
of Korsør, Slagelse and Skælskør in 2005 and 2006<br/>
</li><li>The Young People Project&#8221; of the Copenhagen Municipal Libraries, 2006<br/>
</li><li>How to become a good intermediary or communicator?&#8221; carried out at the
Gentofte Libraries in 2005
</li></ul>
<p>
The three projects can characterised as action research in the sense
that the principle behind strategic reflexive conversation has been relied on in
all three projects. Knowledge has been generated in an active interplay between
researchers and practitioners relying on the vehicle of strategic reflexive
conversation. Among the objectives set up was to enhance the theoretical
understanding of strategic reflexive conversation. Another objective was to
alter new thinking in relation to the organisational practice in libraries with
regard to 1) library development; 2) library practice and 3) knowledge on the
developments progressing in the library&#8217;s surroundings (the perspective). What was developed in
the projects is a change mechanism, which has supported the employees and the
organisation in their efforts to reflect on and adjust or alter their systems.
The process was conducted as an equal relationship between the researcher and
the library practitioners.</p>
<p>The three selected library development projects
included in the present project only constitute a small part of the many
projects that have been initiated in Danish libraries. The reasoning underlying
and characteristic to the three projects is that they all take place in public
library environments of some size, i.e. public libraries that operate fairly
large development units and where innovation is receiving high priority in the
library&#8217;s information policy. Discretely, the three library development projects
represent central themes in the current Danish library policy debate and taken
together they represent a certain scatter on different types of development
projects.</p>
<h3>Project: the good library fusion</h3>

<p>The background of the project was a library fusion involving three independent
local library systems, which were to be merged into one library system by 1
January 2007. The three public library directors wanted to seize the opportunity
of formulating one joint library policy and a single vision for the new united
library system. At the same time, the public library directors emphasised the
importance of paving the way for library development. The ambition was, and
still is, a large and spectacular one: the new library system should go for
ranking among the best ones in the country in few years&#8217; time. In the period
August-November 2005, a round of strategic reflexive conversation was undertaken
together with the three library directors who went through a comprehensive
strategic process. A number of interviews were conducted involving the
libraries&#8217; managements and a selection of employees from the three libraries.
For the rest of the staff in the three public library systems, the process based
on strategic reflexive conversation only started in December 2005. It was
initiated by a two-day workshop numbering a total of 70 persons. The
discussion/conversations were about the uncertain future of libraries and about
the fusion between the three libraries ahead. The overall process including
strategic reflexive conversation resulted in the identification of four
different future types of library users, but present profiles of library users,
which each of them challenge a modern library, were isolated as well. In
particular, two types of users are expected to challenge the library and
librarians with their traditional informational and knowledge competences
because of changes in the users&#8217; behaviour.</p>
<p>The discussion within the framework of the project focused on the users. Four different types of users/user clienteles were
distinguished: 1) Those with both an extensive informational competence and a
great knowledge competence; 2) those with a limited informational competence but
with a great knowledge competence; 3) those with a well-developed informational
competence but with a poor knowledge-specific competence; 4) those with both a
poor informational competence and a scanty knowledge competence.
</p>
<h3>Project: &#8221;Young People&#8221;</h3>
<p>The purpose of applying scenario planning in a library development project in
the Copenhagen Municipal Libraries was to produce knowledge to be drawn upon in
devising a variety of strategies for assessing and, if desired, for implementing
one or more library initiatives or projects with a clear profile in relation to
young users of the library and which can be generalised to and serve as
prototypes in the rest of Denmark. Moreover, the aim was to stimulate library
development with a considerable innovative element provided by specialisation
with focus on youngsters. Strategic reflexive conversation was initiated during
the period May &#8211; December 2006 within the steering group for the Young People
Project. The steering group numbered five persons. Besides, the library director
and two external persons participated in the process. </p>
<p>
The process lasted from May to December 2006. Six introductory interviews were
undertaken with the steering group and the library director. A total of five
scenario workshops with the steering group were conducted. In addition, two
external persons attended the first scenario workshop. In November, the final
meeting, which included the presentation of the result of the scenario process
to the library director, took place. At a theme day in December 2006, the result
was presented to attending colleagues in the Copenhagen Municipal Libraries. The
introductory interviews served as input to the subsequent scenario workshops.
The material partly served to stimulate the reflection activity of the
informants interviewed and partly offered a tool for the meeting leader (the
researcher) in designing and implementing the subsequent process. A special
interrogation method: &#8221;strategic reflexive interrogation technique,&#8221; which aims
to challenge participants&#8217; mental models and basic assumptions, was used. Also
applied were the so-called trigger questions, which make the informants reflect
on their own answers and thereby sets off a sort of knowledge production and/or
learning process. As part of the scenario process, the discussion is widened and
focused alternately. It is widened using, for instance, brainstorming and
generation of ideas and it is narrowed down by, for instance, cutting to the
bone and isolating the core. This process can be compared to an accordion that
is folded in and out alternately. The discussion was visualised and maintained
through externalisation. A mutual frame of reference was generated along with
mental models and a situation-specific language capability and linguistic
awareness among the participants. Concretely, what was achieved here was a new
way of speaking about young people, and library facilities for youngsters,
within the steering group.</p>
<p>Within the framework of &#8221;The Young People Project&#8221;
discussions also centred on the users. Here six different young user types/user
groups were distinguished: 1) The really well read, reading and
quality-conscious young empowered and responsible citizen who wants to get
absorbed in the literature with the aim of developing a solid educational
background in the literary field through life-long studies or learning; 2) The
young borderline confrontational, eksperimenting and resourceful individual; 3)
The quiet and anonymous young person who is capable of navigating in the library
space herself/himself without appreciable use of or need for assistance provided
by library staff; 4) Young heavy consumers of information and knowledge who
request access to all kinds of media and database. They are characterised by
possessing an extensive informational as well as a great knowledge competence.
It can occur that these young people make use of the library in carrying out
their job, in pursuing their career, in doing business, for entrepreneurial
purposes, etc.; 5) Globalists. Those young people who have really realised and
appreciated the opportunities the world is opening up to them and thereby
allowing them to develop the company model of the future. The young people of
this category are those who challenge their own and others&#8217; identity through
self self-realisation and making the most of their personal potential; 6) &#8221;the
follow ups&#8221;. Typical of these young people is that they do not spot the hottest
and most recent trends themselves, but they are the first ones to use and
distribute them. Those who make the most recent trends common property.
</p>
<h3>The Project &#8221;How to Become a Good Intermediary and Communicator&#8221;</h3>
<p>The project entitled &#8221;How to become a good intermediary and communicator&#8221; was
carried out at the Gentofte Libraries i 2005. At its starting point the, the aim
of the project was to develop and try out methods that could be of support to
libraries in handling the task of shifting the focus from materials selection
towards mediation, communication and dialogue with the library&#8217;s users. Nine
librarians from five different libraries contributed to the project. Each
participant brought with him, or her, a sub-project that was related to the aim
of the chief project. This was a precondition of participating in the project.
Within the context of the project, a total of six meetings were arranged during
the period 30 March &#8211; 16 November 2005. Briefly, the sequence of meetings was
organised as follows: 1) mapping/identification of participants&#8217; mental models
in relation to their daily practice of knowledge sharing and communication of
knowledge; 2) challenging these mental models and 3) change and &#8221;enhancement&#8221; of
mental models. The aim was to get participants to reflect on practice so as to
achieve a critically different approach to considering one&#8217;s own practice.</p>
<p>
Considering the theory development centring on the conceptual framework for
strategic reflexive conversation, something decisive happened during the
sequence from March to November. The meeting leaders partly reformulated the
aims and objectives of the very project addressing the issue &#8221;How to become a
good intermediary and communicator?&#8221; During the overall process, the starting
point with focus on methodological development was redefined and extended to
covering a focus on theory and methodological developments cf. Gaml &amp;
Kristiansson (<a href="#gam06">2006</a>).</p>
<p>The discussions in the context of the project started addressing such topics as:
Communication of new media; knowledge of databases; web services; internal
knowledge sharing and an alternative acquisitions and collection development
model. At a later stage, discussion moved on to considering how a new situation
of mediation and communication challenges the libraries. The notion of library
collection was discussed and during the discussion sequence a new and broader
meaning was added to the term. Characteristic to this broadening of the concept
is the inclusion of information on the Internet. The library as a physical space
was discussed and challenged as well. Two new concepts were introduced:
communication/conveying competence and the communicational and
mediation-specific situation.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The outcome of the present study is the development and appearance of new
practice-related knowledge generated in the context of three tangible library
development projects. The new body of knowledge developed is discernible mainly
in the development of new concepts, changes in the meaning of existing
library-related concepts and in narratives circumscribing the three library
development projects. On the other hand, the action research project reported
here has only to a lesser extent contributed to the implementation of concrete
sub-projects in terms of, for instance, new or improved library services and
products. In reviewing the projects conducted, it appears that they have all
offered a contribution to reformulating and rethinking the notion of the library
&#8211; juxtaposed to the trends in the knowledge society. In the project labelled The
Good Library Fusion, discussions centred on informational competence and
knowledge competence and four library narratives covering the nature of required
competences were created. In the project labelled Young People, the discussion
moved on to innovation and identity and four new library narratives were created
on these two entities. In the project addressing the theme of How to become a
Good Intermediary and Communicator, a radically new understanding of the notion
of communication, mediation and conveying materialised. A salient feature of all
three projects is their contribution to developing an increased consciousness
about different categories of user clienteles and their implications for library
offerings and services. </p>
<p>
In addition to this, the project has substantiated that strategic reflexive
conversation can, with advantage, be relied on in the context of action
research. Strategic reflexive conversation creates the space, arena or
atmosphere capable of bringing about a co-operation between different players
together aiming at jointly producing practice-related knowledge structured
around concrete projects. Furthermore, Strategic reflexive conversation serves
as an eminent tool designed for bringing about/catalysing/provoking reflection
within the participants&#8217; group and producing reflected knowledge. Besides, it
appears that, in the sense of conceptual framework, strategic reflexive
conversation represents a conceptual-theoretical integrity. Moreover, a type of
non-scientific knowledge is relied on &#8211; in the shape of scenario narratives &#8211;
which seems especially enriching in terms of library development and which
constitutes a knowing beyond the intellect: an attempt to extend the ways of
knowing. In addition, Strategic reflexive conversation represents methodological
appropriateness as explained in the reflections on the methodology of the
present project. Besides, the very aim of the action research project &#8211; library
development &#8211; is relevant to libraries in a society characterised as it is by
rapid change. The problem of the action research project is, however, that there
is no guarantee that the positive outcomes and effects are of a long-term
nature. On the contrary, you can expect that the effects will weaken over time
if the action research exercise is not currently followed up by similar types of
initiatives and activities (cf. Reason &amp; Bradbury <a href="#rea06"> 2006</a>: 12,
333-51)</p>


<h2>Assessing the results achieved from the context of action research</h2>

<p>As a conceptual framework, strategic reflexive conversation has proved valuable
in relation to action research. Evidence supporting this statement is provided
by the results of three concrete library development projects undertaken in 2005
and 2006. An effort was made to design a conceptual framework that is accurate
and simple: a discursive strategy, which builds on scenario planning enriched by
a discourse-theoretical understanding/interpretation and combined with a modus 2
inspired type of action research. It is suggested that the strategy be applied
to library development in the knowledge society. The strategy appears sturdy
because it has proved its practical use: empirical evidence shows that it
functions in practical settings. We have become wiser, both theoretically and
practically. </p>
<p>
However, it seems necessary to ventilate some comments and put forward
some criticism. First, practice is required along with capability of
carrying out strategic reflexive conversation in practical
environments. Second, the empirical basis of the present study appears
too small to fully justify the strategy. It is always so that
circumstances may arise that create non-expected results. One cannot be
sure that the same effect can be achieved every time. The context has a
role to play. Further, the effects of the process are of a long-term
nature and stretch into the future and we do not know how each project
will develop. This must be further examined at a successive stage.
Also, there are many factors that impact on the process and it is very
difficult to isolate these factors from the process covering strategic
reflexive conversation. Special circumstances and conditions within the
library system or in the local community may cause a project to develop
into a particularly bad or advantageous direction. The composition of
the group of participants is very crucial; unfortunately the
composition of the group of participants in these three investigations
has not been transdisciplinary but very homogeneous and dominated by
librarians. What we know for sure is that the three projects detailed
above have got a successful start. Indisputable innovative thinking of
relevance to library development within all three projects has been
developed. Project participants from the three library systems confirm
this observation. Also, in three cases, strategies for library
developments have been formulated and in addition to this outcome a new
view or conception of the library&#8217;s surrounding context, including the
developments affecting the library&#8217;s situation, has emerged among
participants in the projects.</p>

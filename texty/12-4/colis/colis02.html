<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This title probably needs some explanation by way of introduction! I contribute as a practitioner who, by the accident of career development, has a long-standing interest in what common ground there may be between information professionals and information designers. I first published some reflections on the theme in the early 90s (Orna &amp; Stevens, <a href="#orn91">1991</a>, <a href="#orn93">1993</a>). I returned to thinking about it, with an increased emphasis on the organizational context in which such collaboration might take place, in doctoral research over a five-year period ending in 1999 (Orna, <a href="#orn96">1996</a>, <a href="#orn99">1999</a>, <a href="#orn01">2001</a>), and then in a book about &quot;making knowledge   visible&quot; (Orna, <a href="#orn05">2005</a>). And this past year, working with the typographer and designer Graham Stevens on a new edition of a book for research students (Orna &amp; Stevens, to be published <a href="#orn08">2008</a>), which deals with both information management for research and the writing and designing of dissertations, has provided many practical opportunities for considering the nature of this interdisciplinary collaboration, and why it is needed.</p>

<p> The passage of time and changes brought by the technology to how information 
  is searched for, managed, and presented to the eye of the user make the topic 
  yet more relevant and the need more urgent. Sixteen years ago (Orna &amp; Stevens 
  <a href="#orn91">1991</a>) we wrote of the wider range of people than ever before 
  who were engaged in &quot;jobs where they do things (sometimes awful things)&quot; 
  to information. Awful things are still being done by a wide range of people; 
  the potential of the web technology to extend the scope for doing them is being 
  fully exploited; and the costs are borne by those who have to use the results 
  in their work.</p>
  
<p> I should add, perhaps, that although this paper is a contribution to the third
  theme of CoLIS 6 &#8211; &quot;LIS versus New Research and Professional Fields&quot;
  &#8211; it does not follow the adversarial implication of &quot;versus&#8217;;
  I am advocating co-operation and conversation rather than calling LIS to arms
  in defence of its territory.</p>
  
<h2>Information design</h2>

<p>While readers of this journal probably all have a their own clear definition 
  of the LIS professions and what they do, the same may not be true when it comes 
  to the &quot;information design discipline&#8217;. So here are some short definitions 
  to bear in mind:</p>
  
<blockquote>Information design can be broadly defined as everything we do to make visible our knowledge and ideas so that those who need them can enter into them and use what they learn from them for their own purposes.  (Orna, <a href="#orn05">2005</a>) </blockquote>
  
<blockquote>Information designers create and manage the relationship between people and information so that the information is accessible and usable by people, and they provide evidence that the information is accessible and usable to an agreed high standard.  (Sless, <a href="#sle07b">2007</a>)</blockquote> 
  
<blockquote>Design is the intermediary between information and understanding. (Gref&eacute;, 2007) </blockquote>
  
<p>More will be said about information design and designers later on, but for 
  the moment those brief definitions are useful because they point to the kind 
  of activities and processes in which I believe the disciplines should collaborate. 
  You will note that they relate not to persuasion or selling, but to clearing 
  obstacles to understanding the ideas of others out of the way of information 
  users.</p>
  
<h2>Collaboration on what?</h2>

<p>Evidence from experience over many years convinces me that the the LIS
  and information-design professions should and could co-operate to
  support the difficult transformation processes that human beings have to
  undertake in order to get what they have in their heads into the &quot;inside
  of
  other people's heads&quot;, and the equally difficult transformations that the
  &quot;other people&quot; have to make, to take into their heads what they want
  or
  need.</p>
<p>
  For purposes of discussing the present topic &#8211; and no more than that,
  for I am not aiming to provide all-embracing definitions &#8211; I shall call
  what
  we have inside our heads &quot;knowledge&quot; and what we turn it into to make
  it
  visible/accessible to other people &quot;information&quot;. Figure 1 is a visual
  metaphor for what goes on in this process of transformation without
  which no communication, no society, no business could exist:</p>
  
<div align="center"><img src="colis02fig1.jpeg" alt="fig1" width="652" height="446" align="middle" /></div>

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 1: Transformations: information to knowledge, knowledge
  to information</strong> </div>
  
<p>Part of the intention of that picture is to show that we all live in two worlds,
  between which we are constantly moving: the inner world to which only we have
  direct access (and that only partially and imperfectly) of thoughts, ideas,
  feelings, memory - what I am calling knowledge - by which we guide our lives;
  and the external physical world of nature and society. Interaction between the
  two worlds, and communication between the human beings who live in them are
  essential for life and survival.</p>
  
<h2>A vacant space</h2>

<p>But something is missing in this picture. What do we put our knowledgetransformed-
  into-information into when we want to transfer it from inner
  to outer world, so that others can see it and start doing their own
  transformation of information-into-knowledge?</p> 
  
<p> The LIS professions talk a great deal about content these days &#8211; and 
  I shall come back to that later. Here I shall say only that it always surprises 
  me that few of us seem to recognise that content is literally &quot;that which 
  is contained&quot;, and that it can't exist without a container &#8211; a point 
  made with great clarity in relation to knowledge and information by McArthur 
  in his Worlds of Reference (<a href="#mca86">1986</a>, Chapter 3).</p>
<p>
  The combination of information content and container is described
  today (probably by more people outside Europe than in it) as an
  <em>information product</em> &#8211; an unlovely term, but for the moment the
  best we
  have to cover the general category.</p>
<p> Information products are, as shown in Figure 2, what should occupy the vacant 
  space &#8211; because it is in them that minds meet and knowledge becomes available 
  for transfer to other people's heads (Neil Gaiman, the author whom I quoted 
  on getting what he had in his head into the inside of other people's heads went 
  on to remark that &quot;Books are good that way.&quot;)</p>
  
<div align="center"><img src="colis02fig2.jpeg" width="627" height="447" alt="Minds meet in information products" /></div>

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 2: Minds meet in information products</strong></div>

<h2><strong>Information products</strong></h2>

<p>So that is the area where collaboration between LIS professionals and
  information designers is needed: creating the information products that
  organizations need.</p>
  
<p>Figure 3 presents a brief definition of them, with some examples:</p>

<div align="center"><img src="colis02fig3.jpeg" width="691" height="449" alt="Information products defined" /></div>
<div align="center"><strong>Figure 3: Information products defined</strong></div>

<ul>
  <li>Information products are a combination of content and container, in which the container consists of medium and what we might call &#8216;bibliographic form&#8217;, and they come in many different forms, and many media, from the clay tablets of Mesopotamia on. The container may or may not be a good match for the content. If they are not well matched to one other, and to the users and how they want to use them, it spells trouble for the users.</li>
	
  <li> Some information products, from medieval encyclopaedias to websites and intranets, are &#8216;meta-information products&#8217; because they contain multiple other products within them.</li>
	
  <li>Today the digital media of presentation have so dominant a role that we are in some danger of believing them to be the only information products worth attention &#8211; which is far from the case. I fear that much of this dominance, and the attempt by both business and government &#8211; at any rate in the UK&#8211; to shepherd all users towards the electronic form of information products, is driven by competition, cost-cutting, and shareholder interests, rather than care for customers.</li>
	
  <li>They are at the &#8216;telling&#8217; end of a spectrum that runs from &#8216;selling&#8217; 
to &#8216;telling&#8217;; in that they are usually created to meet more or 
less known information needs of actual/potential users, rather than to generate 
desire for possession. Observation and experience suggest, however, that real 
users, how they actually need to use information products in their work, and 
their experiences in using what&#8217;s offered to them are neglected by the 
creators of such products. All too often users are 
offered poorly planned products, with weak structural links, that lead them 
into a maze of frustration. And users are very seldom brought in as collaborators 
    in developing the information products they need in their work. And so it 
    comes about that the negative value of information products that let down 
    the users is not taken into account.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me repeat that I&#8217;m not saying that the only definition of
  information is human knowledge transformed and put into the outside
  world in information products; I accept that information can occur in
  many forms and not just in information products. This particular form,
  and the associated transformations, are the focus here because they are
  both important and neglected.</p>
<h2>Why information products are important for organizations</h2>
<p>They are important in the organizational context because:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Without them, little business could be done inside organizations, or between 
    them and the outside world.</li>
  <li>organizations create them for communicating knowledge and exchanging knowledge 
    with their inside and outside worlds &#8211; the people who work in them, 
    and the customers, clients or others who make up the &quot;outside world&quot; 
    which they are in business to serve.</li>
  <li>Those who use them need to be able to find the information content that's 
    of value them, absorb it readily, understand it correctly, and transform it 
    to inner knowledge, which they can then use as the basis for successful action; 
    and all with minimum loss of time.</li>
  <li>Information products are essential not just for communicating and applying 
    knowledge, but also for the security and preservation of the information and 
    knowledge that organizations need in order to survive and prosper.</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure 4 summarises what they should do for the organizations that create
  them.</p>
  
<div align="center">

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 4: What information products should do for organizations</strong></div>

<h2>Adding and subtracting value</h2>
<p>If an organization&#8217;s information products are doing all that for it, 
  they will be adding value to everything it does. But failure to do all they 
  should, and subtracting value rather than adding it, is probably more common 
  than complete success. Figure 5 shows the ways in which they can do both.</p>
  
<div align="center">

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 5: How information products add and subtract value</strong></div>

<h2>Why are they neglected? How and why do they fail?</h2>
<p>If they are so vital and have such an effect on value, why do
  organizations neglect their information products?
  As shown in Figure 6, many interacting causes reinforce one another in a
  self-perpetuating cycle that favours failure rather than success, negative
  rather than positive value.</p>
  
<div align="center">

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 6: The self-perpetuating cycle that makes information products fail</strong></div>
  

<p>They are discussed in detail in Orna (<a href="#orn05">2005,</a> Chapters 3 
  &#8211; 5). Given the subject of this paper, I shall concentrate here on the 
  relation between the value that information products add and subtract and:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The degree to which management recognises the interests of the many
    stakeholders in information products (as shown in Figure 7) , and
    encourages them to co-operate in contributing to them &#8211; with particular
    reference to LIS professionals, those responsible for the relevant IT
    infrastructure, and information designers.</li>
</ul>

<div align="center"><img src="colis02fig7.jpeg" width="681" height="449" alt="The mainly unrecognised stakeholders in organizational information products" /></div>
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 7: The mainly unrecognised stakeholders in organizational information products</strong></div>

<ul>
  <li>How effectively the organizations that create them manage their resources 
    of knowledge and information</li>
  <li> What actually meets the eye of users when they encounter the products on 
    screen or on paper. In particular, the science of how we read, and its importance 
    for effective communication, is little appreciated, and, from ignorance of 
    it, obstacles are unwittingly placed in the way of readers, which make it 
    harder to perform this exceptionally complex and demanding activity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Situations that subtract value</h2>

<p>Let us begin by looking at some of the situations (see Figure 8) that subtract 
  value from the information products that organizations inflict upon their inner 
  and outer worlds &#8211; all of which could be improved if the combined knowledge 
  and skills of LIS and IT professionals and information designers were applied 
  to them, and if users were included in the process. Some of them will be illustrated 
  with stories from real life.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="colis02fig8.jpeg" width="466" height="432" alt="Situations that subtract value from Information Products"/></div>

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 8: Situations that subtract value from Information Products</strong></div>
<ol>
  <li>Users don&#8217;t know of the existence of the information products they
    need,
    because nobody has told them about them.</li>
  <li>When they seek information their search is frustrated by inappropriate
    indexing, lack of metadata, and lack of standards for the information
    architecture of the products.</li>
</ol>
<p>This may be because the organization has no appropriate information
  professionals, or has them but doesn&#8217;t ask them to apply their skills
  to
  its information products. This story is from a consultancy assignment in
  the mid-1980s, but the same type of failure has continued through each
  succeeding generation of computer-based information products (online
  user Help for software, for instance, is usually less helpful than it ought
  to be because of capricious indexing and lack of terminology control).</p>
<blockquote>The client was a small business recently acquired by a large publisher. 
  It depended on delivering a single information product &#8211; reports analysing 
  the advertisements and advertisers in trade and technical journals &#8211; to 
  publishers in that field. Potentially a useful piece of competitor intelligence, 
  it was losing customers as fast as it gained them because. One of the main reasons 
  quickly became clear: its previous management had failed to recognise that the 
  quality of the product depended on the professional information skills essential 
  for full and consistent indexing. In consequence, this work was part of the 
  job of the production assistants who input text, and they were recruited for 
  their keyboard skills. Their casual approach to indexing drastically reduced 
  the value of the end product to the users. This central weakness was compounded 
  by the fact that although every member of the small staff &#8211; data processing, 
  production, sales and account managers as well as those responsible for input 
  &#8211; had a direct contribution to the end product, there were no standards 
  for essential day-to-day communication among them; staff did not have a clear 
  statement of
<ul>
  <li>What information they needed to give to other people</li>
  <li>Who to consult for particular kinds of information and advice</li>
  <li>Who they were responsible to for different parts of their work.</li>
</ul>
The software in use for processing the inputs into reports was poorly
  matched to the requirements of the job, and the procedures for inhouse
  printing of reports did not bear thinking about.

  Among the first steps in the phased recovery plan, alongside some
  essential changes in recruitment policy, were a set of small self-help
  information products for staff &#8211; written and designed in collaboration
  by the information consultant and an information designer. They
  included:
<ul>
  <li> Procedures guide</li>
  <li>Guide to using terms consistently</li>
  <li>A &quot;Who tells who what&quot; for staff</li>
  <li>A &quot;management manual&quot; to help the managers of different
    functions  understand their colleagues&#8217; jobs and their information needs.</li>
</ul>

These products were used in conjunction with a training programme,
  and formed the basis for a series of actions to deal with the interrelated
  set of communication, IT and systems, and production
  problems that had nearly sunk the company.</blockquote>
  
<ol>
  <li value="3">IT tools don&#8217;t support users in information search, or inusing what
    they
    find; are inappropriate for the job they have to do; or are not properly
    understood by those who have to use them for managing information.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>This is a tragic story, of an appalling series of events in an English
  country town that ended in the murder of two children by a school
  caretaker. It involves a fatal combination of systems flaws (both
  electronic and paper-based) and abysmal information management by
  police forces in two areas. At the heart of it were those most sensitive
  and critical information products &#8211; criminal records. The records in
  the area where the murderer had lived before getting the job in a
  school contained information about him that &#8211; had it been known &#8211;
  would have ensured he never got a post working with children. But it
  had been deleted by the time he got the job. The police force&#8217;s main
  intelligence system was revealed at the subsequent inquiry to have
  been introduced in a way which was &quot;hasty, under-researched, under
  funded&quot;; it was not properly understood by the people who had to
  operate it, and changes to it in late 1999 to counter the threat of the
  millennium bug&quot; resulted in general intelligence notes being removed
  from a third of the force&#8217;s records.<br /><br />
As the report of the inquiry (Bichard <a href="#bi04">2004</a>) put it, 
  &quot;Police officers at various levels were alarmingly ignorant of how records 
  were created and how the system worked. The guidance and training available 
  were inadequate and this fed the confusion which surrounded the review and deletion 
  of records once they had been created &#8230; there was not even a common understanding 
  of what was meant by weeding. reviewing and deletion &#8220;weeding&#8221;.<br />
  &#8220;reviewing&#8221; and &#8220;deletion&#8221;&quot;. And, unusually for 
  such reports, the main recommendations for action included &quot;A new Code 
  of Practice on information management&quot; (So far as I know, the report did 
  not mention the design of records or instructions, but I&#8217;m prepared to 
  bet that it contributed its share to ignorance and confusion.)</blockquote>

    one, and may
    be acting on superseded policies or procedures.</li>
  <li> Information content inaccurate, out of date, not from most authoritative
    source available.</li>
  <li> Essential information missing.</li>
  <li> Content structure and or sequence chaotic.</li>
</ol>

<p> Public bodies &#8211; at any rate in the UK &#8211; seem very prone to disasters 
  resulting from information products deficient in these respects. These two stories 
  suggest an unmet need for combined inputs from information managers and information 
  designers.</p>
  
<blockquote>A few years ago the government department responsible for giving
  guidance to pensioners about the effect of changes in legislation was
  judged by the Parliamentary Ombudsman to have provided
  &quot;misleading and inadequate information&quot; in a leaflet, and so to
  be
  guilty of maladministration, while the National Audit Office reported
  that its failure to provide &quot;correct and timely&quot; information would
  lead
  to the loss of huge sums of anticipated savings from the changes, plus
  the costs of compensating those pensioners fortunate enough to be
  able to prove they were 'actively misled'.
</blockquote>

<p>That was bad enough, but incomparably worse was the contribution that manuals 
  for social workers in a number of local authorities in England made to the suffering 
  of an eight-year-old girl, murdered after terrible abuse by her guardian.</p>
  
<blockquote>The inquiry that followed revealed that there was no standard text of guidance 
  for these social workers on their responsibilities under the law. Instead there 
  was a free-for-all that allowed different local authorities to produce their 
  own, which were inaccurate and out of date; the staff to whom they were supposed 
  to give guidance in some cases didn&#8217;t know of their existence, those who 
  did found them so badly written and organized that they couldn&#8217;t make 
  sense of them. No wonder that the report of the inquiry (Department of Health/Home 
  Department, <a href="#dep03">2003</a>) recommended that staff working with vulnerable 
  children must be provided with 'up-to-date procedures, protocols and guidance 
  &#8230; located in a single-source document.'</blockquote>
  
<ol>
  <li value="8">Textual presentation inappropriate for users&#8217; knowledge, 
    background, ways in which they need to use the information, and/or lacking 
    consistent standards for presentation.</li>
  <li>Visual presentation (typography, graphics, layout, materials, medium)
    inappropriate for users and or ways in which they need to use the
    information, and/or lacks consistent standards.</li>
</ol>

<p>The number of information products that combine these features is
  legion, and the value they subtract is correspondingly great. They are the
  way they are because the organizations that originate them rarely bring
  users into the process of planning them and seldom draw on their own
  LIS professionals&#8217; knowledge of users; and that knowledge is not made
  available to the designers.</p>
  
<blockquote>This is a cautionary tale from a consultancy firm which was strong on
  information management and IT skills, but not on matching the
  textual and visual presentation of its findings to the needs of the
  client.
<br /><br />
  Things went swimmingly with an information audit until the first
  version of its report was presented, when much of the warmth went
  out of the relationship. The report used a lot of technical IT language,
  which seriously upset the senior managers to whom it was addressed,
  because they lacked knowledge and experience of the technology &#8211;
  that was indeed one of the reasons for the information audit. The
  arrangement of the report was quite different from the schedule used
  to gather information in the interviews, with different headings from
  the ones they had become used to. And it contained several large and
  very unrefined tables, which, while clear to the compilers were
  anything but to the clients. It proved impossible to undo the harm
  caused, even though the report was revised, with great cost in time;
  trust was lost, some of the most important recommendations rejected,
  and no continuation of the assignment resulted. A costly exercise in
  every respect, and one that could have been avoided by some
  consultation with the client&#8217;s information staff!</blockquote>
  
<p>Institutions of higher education inadvertently do a disservice in this
  respect to research students, and to those who have to assess their
  dissertations, by not advising researchers thoroughly on the visual
  presentation of their work and the information cues that LIS
  professionals are so familiar with, from reference formats to indexes and
  informative headings. Dissertations often conceal rather than reveal the
  important features of their authors&#8217; research and give examiners and
  other readers an unnecessarily hard time in grasping the conceptual
  structure &#8211; as my designer colleague and co-author, Graham Stevens,
  recently observed from a survey of a range of these important
  information products.</p>
  
<blockquote>Findings suggest that the majority of researchers lacked the
  necessary typographic knowledge for designing pages which are easy
  and comfortable to read; they seemed to be unaware of how to avoid
  placing obstacles in the path of their readers, and in many cases
  produced documents that could be described as visually illiterate,
  instead of achieving visual clarity. The main manifestations of this
  are:
  
<ol>
  <li> Pages with acres of grey and monotonous text and very little to relieve 
    the monotony</li>
  <li>Excessively long reading line with too many words, making it far more difficult 
    to read</li>
  <li>Frequently an absence of headings in the text to help the reader to navigate 
    and follow the story</li>
  <li>Little appreciation of the importance of using horizontal and vertical space 
    as a technique of grouping and separating elements of information to aid navigation. 
    Orna &amp; Stevens (forthcoming, <a href="#orn08">2008</a>)</li>
</ol></blockquote>

<p>There is good news sometimes; this story from Australia reinforces the
  point that it is the ordinary everyday information products which are
  most in need of design attention but get least of it; and that omission
  has high costs.</p>
  
<blockquote>An insurance company asked the Communication Research Institute of Australia 
  to improve the quality of forms on which it collected the information it needed 
  from customers. The Institute&#8217;s analysis of a sample of forms found a 
  100 per cent error rate, with dire effects on how long it took to accept proposals. 
  Their redesign was based on investigating the organizational politics (something 
  on which CRI is particularly strong), and bringing the stakeholders in sales 
  and form processing into the development process. It reduced error rates from 
  100 to 15 per cent and cut turnaround time significantly. The saving on time 
  in terms of the salaries of staff involved came to 5 times the cost of the whole 
  project.  Fisher &amp; Sless (<a href="#fis90">1990</a>)</blockquote>
  
<p>By way of contrast, another example concerning the design of forms on which 
  members of the general public have to enter important information. Those who 
  have to provide for such situations should proceed with care, and expect trouble. 
  Trouble they certainly got in this instance, and it appears that they may not 
  have appreciated the nature of the problem.</p>
  
<blockquote>On 3 May this year, Scottish voters had to register their votes in two
  elections: a General Election for the Scottish Parliament, and elections
  for Scotland&#8217;s local authorities. The parliamentary election is on the
  first-past-the-post principle, but voters have to give two kinds of votes:
  one to elect members for individual constituencies, and one for a
  regional list. In the last Scottish Parliamentary elections these two
  lists were presented on separate ballot papers; this time they were set
  out in two columns on a single ballot paper &#8211; which foxed a lot of
  voters, and led to 142,000 rejected votes.<br /><br />
The results as might have been expected were a quite spectacular 
  mess. The Scotland director for the Electoral Reform Society said cautiously 
  '... it does seem to be something about the way it was designed or the instructions 
  that were given.'</blockquote>
  
<p>A perceptive conclusion, which turned out to be accurate in the
light of subsequent Strathclyde University research (Carman &
Mitchell, 2007). The authors found that the highest rates of rejection
were in constituencies where social deprivation was higher and
educational qualifications lower than average. Further analysis showed
that ballot design and structure was strongly related to voters’ failure
to complete the forms correctly. There was distinct statistical evidence
that number of parties in the regional lists in constituencies was a
significant predictor of rejected ballots; the more of them there were,
the less space for the text of instructions and for the explanatory
graphics. Carman and Mitchell conclude that: ‘<em>... our research
indicates that the different ‘rules’ (or ballot design) used in different
regions in Scotland had a very clear and distinct influence on the
number of constituency ballots rejected.</em>’ and that the effect is
strongest in the least affluent constituencies. In other words poor
design and instructions have acted to further disadvantage alreadydisadvantaged
electors.</p>
<p>This episode of damage to democracy might have been avoided
with some help from public librarians, who know a good deal about
the information behaviour of the general public, and from information
designers, who are skilled in presenting complex instructions in
forms.</p>

<h2>What library and information science, information and communication technologies, and information design professionals could and/or should contribute to information products</h2>
  
<p>Now let us look at exactly what unique contributions people in the LIS
  professions, those who manage the relevant technologies, and
  information designers could, and should, jointly make to the creation of
  information products.</p>
<p>
  I am not suggesting that the collaboration requires information
  professionals to become amateur graphic/typographic designers, in
  order to design marketing products for their services; or that designers
  should become amateur information managers. That would be to devalue
  the expertise of both. The important thing is that each profession should
  understand the value of its own expertise in this respect, appreciate the
  value of what the others know, and come to see the scope for their
  collaboration on information products. Figure 9 summarises their
  respective contributions and how they should meet and interact in the
  development and creation of information products.</p>
  
<div align="center">

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 9: The intersection of the knowledge of ibrary and information science, information and communication technologies  and information design professionals</strong></div>
  
<h2>Lirary and information science professionals</h2>
<p>The relation between information professionals and information products
  strikes me as a rather strange one. On one hand, we take them for
  granted, as the things we deal with in managing information; but on the
  other, the idea that we have a contribution to make to their creation
  doesn&#8217;t seem to have occurred to many of us.</p>
<p>
  These are some of the unique things that knowledge and information
  managers could offer. To start with, their training gives them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Understanding of &quot;Tools of the mind&quot; for thinking about and
    using
    information</li>
  <li>Experience in applying consistent structure and standards to help people
    access and use information
    all of which is applicable to the development of useful information
    products.</li>
</ul>
<p>Experience in organizations gives them other unusual assets which ought
  to be applied to a strategy for its information products.</p>
<ul>
  <li>They know the organization&#8217;s objectives and what they imply for what
    it
    needs to know, and the information it needs to feed its knowledge.</li>
  <li>They know its resources of information content, and are capable of seeing 
    their potential for use in multiple ways in information products.</li>
  <li>If it has an information strategy and architecture they are likely to be
    involved in its development, and able to see how it should shape
    decisions about the organization&#8217;s information products.</li>
  <li>They know who knows what in the organization, how willing they are to
    communicate and exchange their knowledge with others; and how much
    the organization encourages them to do so.</li>
  <li>They know the people who need to use information products in their
    work, and the context in which they need to use them.
    and</li>
  <li>They know how the organization really works, the real power structure,
    and the oddities of its culture &#8211; essential knowledge for taking successful
    initiatives of any kind.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information and communication technologies professionals</h2>

<p>If the information management professionals are to apply their knowledge and 
  skills in the ways suggested, the ICT professionals&#8217; contribution to the 
  organization&#8217;s information products will be the complementary one of providing 
  appropriate infrastructure and software tools to support the whole range of 
  stakeholders, in:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Managing all the information content needed for creating information
    products</li>
  <li>Carrying out all the tasks associated with creating, project-managing,
    accessing and using them</li>
  <li>Interacting and co-operating with one another</li>
  <li>Integrating information products into the business strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Their specialist knowledge will be particularly needed in such
  developments as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bringing the publishing process within the scope of content management
    systems to simplify the task of authors whose strength is their subject
    knowledge</li>
  <li> Enabling multiple uses of content from a single source in a variety of
    contexts in different media.</li>
</ul>
<p>And it should be part of their remit to monitor and advise on
  developments in the technology that are relevant to information
  products.</p>
<p>
  I know of one or two cases where IT professionals are contributing in this
  way, but I suspect it is very different from the way their role is more
  often seen vis &agrave; vis information products: as the source of all that
  the
  organization needs to know about developing and designing information
  products, which are regarded as being exclusively electronic and webbased.
  That accounts for a good deal of what meets the eye of users &#8211;
  and often gives them trouble. And that brings us to the unknown third of
  our trio &#8211; the information designers.</p>
<h2>Information designers</h2>
<p>As the definitions of information design I quoted at the start make clear,
  what the users of information products want to do is the first
  consideration; users have an active rather than a passive role, and
  information designers&#8217; first responsibility is to them.</p>
<p>
  So the concerns of information design include: the conceptual
  structure of information products; sequence of presentation; choice of
  medium and format; decisions about how the content is expressed &#8211; in
  text, graphics, numerical tables, or combinations of all these;
  management of the relevant technologies; writing; and typography. This,
  as you will appreciate, gives scope for either collaboration or competition
  with a lot of other specialists!</p>
<p>
  The special skills and knowledge of information designers could and
  should support information products by:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Integrating content and container in appropriate media and presentation,
    to match what users need to do</li>
  <li>Making the conceptual structure plain, and guiding users through it &#8211;
    the
    typographer who has designed all my books describes his work on them,
    with some feeling and great accuracy, as 'You give me complexity; I give
    you simplicity.'</li>
  <li>Reconciling the conflicting needs of the various stakeholders, to give
    optimal solutions</li>
  <li>Respecting the constraints involved, and finding the most effective way
    of working within them</li>
  <li>Expressing the organization&#8217;s values.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you see, the job of information designers extends far beyond making
  products look impressive, into what David Sless describes as &quot;the
  relationship between people and information&quot;, into making information
  products accessible in the sense of being &quot;welcoming, open and
  approachable&quot;. They are concerned both with words as they are used in
  written language and with the &quot;visual language&quot; of typefaces, use
  of
  spacing, graphics, etc. Both are part of what the people who use
  information products see when they encounter them, and that is an
  essential point that is often overlooked. This is an aspect that is perhaps
insufficiently taken into account by many ‘usability’ studies, because the
practitioners in this specialism tend to approach it through knowledge of
human–computer interaction, rather than of the functioning of the
human eye and brain.</p>

<h2>Seeing is perceiving</h2>

<p>Whatever the medium, the way we meet most information products is via human vision and it is the human eye that does the first processing of their content &#8211; a fact that seems to have escaped the notice of those responsible for many information products. </p>

<div align="center"><img src="colis02fig10.jpeg" width="465" height="457" alt="seeing is percieving" /></div>
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Fig. 10 Seeing is perceiving</strong></div>

<p>The human visual system does much of the work of perception; as the biologist and neuroscientist Steven Rose explains:</p>
  
<blockquote>... how does information become transformed into perception,
  become meaningful? &#8230; it happens in the visual cortex itself; multiple
  interconnections link the separate modules, integrating their separate
  analyses; the flow of signals between them is the mechanism of
  perception.</blockquote>
  
<p>This work is most obvious in getting into and around the information
  contained in the products, by reading text and graphics on-screen or
  from paper as an essential step towards turning it into knowledge that
  the reader can then apply. Less obvious to most people, because not
  widely known, is the fact that the <em>way in which what meets our eye is
  presented</em> has great influence on how quickly and readily we can read
  and find what we want and get on with transforming it. With text, this is
  influenced by the shape and size of typefaces, line length, spacing,
  arrangement in paragraphs and under headings. With text, this is
influenced by line length, spacing, and arrangement in paragraphs and
under headings, as well as by the shape and size of typefaces and their
appropriateness for the medium in which they will be read (unlike print
on paper, on-screen text is read by reflective light from the screen, and
that requires a different approach to choosing types).</p>
<p>Still less appreciated is the fact that other forms of visual presentation 
  of knowledge &#8211; such as sketches, diagrams, maps, and realisations of visual 
  metaphors &#8211; are read by the visual system more quickly than text and give 
  a quicker grasp of the whole and of the relations between parts, with better 
  recall.</p>
<p>
  Visual representation of this kind has the advantage over text because
  the majority of the brain's activity deals with processing and analysing
  visual images. They are processed before text, and the processing
  requires less energy. According to Remo Burkhard of the Centre for
  Knowledge Visualization at the University of St Gallen, visual
  representations are superior to verbal-sequential ones in illustrating
  relations, identifying patterns, and presenting both overview and details;
  they support problem solving, and are valuable in communicating
  different types of knowledge (Burkhard, 2004, 2005).</p>
<p>
  This is too part of the knowledge of information designers, as well as
  the visual language of letterforms, spacing, line length, use of white
  space, etc in which information content is presented to the eye, and the
  relevant technologies for realising the presentation. It is worth
remembering that all this knowledge has a particular relevance to the
increasing proportion of the population who suffer some level of visual
handicap, which can affect their ability to access information both onscreen
and on paper. The kind of collaboration advocated in this paper is
particularly desirable between information designers; LIS professionals
like those in CERLIM (the Centre for Research in Library and Information
Management at Manchester Metropolitan University) concerned with
helping visually handicapped people in information search and use;
opthalmologists researching visual handicap; and users who themselves
suffer from these conditions.</p>
<h2>Why they don&#8217;t collaborate</h2>
<p>There is both common ground between the disciplines, and separate kinds of 
  skill and knowledge that shouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to combine. But It&#8217;s 
  rare to find those specialisms applying their skills and knowledge to organizational 
  information products in the ways suggested, and collaborating in the process, 
  with management encouragement. As shown in Figure 11</p>
<ol>
  <li>The three groups usually have a limited view of information products and 
    their role in them.</li>
  <li>They usually have limited understanding of one another&#8217;s skills and 
    knowledge and how they apply them (this is especially true of the relation 
    between LIS professionals and information designers).</li>
  <li>TOTO (Top of The organization &#8211; a more or less affection acronym used 
    in some organizations for senior management) usually has inadequate understanding 
    of what all three know and can do, and of organizational information products.</li>
</ol>
<div align="center"><img src="colis02fig11.jpeg" width="780" height="557" alt="Mutual misunderstanding"/></div>
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 11: Mutual knowledge or mutual misunderstanding?</strong></div>

<p><em>LIS and ICT professionals</em> may be either brought together by organizational 
  structure/culture, on an equal footing, or in different bits of the same organization, 
  with different amounts of power (and I leave readers to guess who has more).</p>
<p> LIS professionals today usually know a good deal about what their IT/IS colleagues 
  do and know; they can have highlevel skills and knowledge of technological tools 
  in their own field, and, in some organizations, opportunity and responsibility 
  for applying them. Reciprocal knowledge on the part of ICT professionals can 
  exist if they are brought together by organizational structure, and the culture 
  supports it &#8211; but it is not always the case.</p>
<p>
  While LIS professionals are usually (though not always) employed inhouse,
  information design is only occasionally in-house, and usually
  outside. If they are in-house, information designers tend to be isolated
  from the specialisms they should be working with: not only from LIS, but
  also from communications professionals and webmasters. If they are
  outside, they are likely to work for a design practice (which may be
  actually designated as an information design practice, as one or two are
  in the UK; or maybe web design or graphic design), and to be engaged
  by clients for specific work on certain information products &#8211; most often
  the high-prestige ones such as annual reports (they are seldom called on
  to look at the everyday products for inside use on which so much work
  depends.) Some work as self-employed designers or in association with
  other related professionals.</p>
<p> Their knowledge of what the other professionals are up to is uneven. Between 
  them and in-house &quot;traditional&quot; ICT professionals, there can be deep 
  hostility; many designers can justly claim much deeper knowledge of technology 
  tools relevant to design in all media than many ICT professionals who hold a 
  lot of power within their organizations. Of the existence, let alone the work, 
  of LIS professionals, nearly all appear to be unaware. (There are some distinguished 
  exceptions, however: the Australian-based Communication Research Institute &#8211; 
  formerly CRIA, and a number of designers in the UK, other European countries, 
  and the USA.)</p>
<p>
  The ignorance is mutual; LIS professionals who know what
  information designers do are few and far between, and fewer still
  actually work in collaboration with them.</p>
<p>In many organizations TOTO has imperfect knowledge of what ICT professionals 
  can and can&#8217;t do, and rather more faith than is justified. This can lead 
  to that group exerting control over the organization&#8217;s information products, 
  often exclusively oriented towards web-based ones, in the absence of any co-ordinated 
  management of the whole range.</p>
<p> Undue faith in ICT is often accompanied by very thin understanding of what 
  LIS professionals know and can do, which results in restricted roles for them 
  and less power than ICT in decision-making. Appreciation of their key role in 
  information products is usually found among the growing number knowledge-based 
  organizations which make their living by creating and selling information products 
  (fortunately, a growing number). TOTO also has little idea of what information 
  design professionals can do and of what their role should be in relation to 
  information. So there is ignorance of how to select appropriate designers for 
  work on information products (hence the frequent use of advertising agencies), 
  of how to brief them, or of who should manage their work &#8211; the task is 
  often assigned to someone at too low a level in the organizational hierarchy.</p>
<p>
  Dealing with the barrier presented by TOTO is probably the most
  difficult task &#8211; demanding ingenuity, craft and guile &#8211; confronting
  any
  attempt to change this situation.</p>
<p>
  Now it is useful to turn a story from experience, which shows how the
  collaboration advocated here can work in practice.</p>
<h2>Collaboration in practice &#8211; a story from experience</h2>
<p><em>The context of this story is an information audit in an English local
  authority, which investigated the information needs of school
  governors (under English law, all schools must have a governing body
  made up of citizens from the local area). Its aim was to provide a
  sound foundation for setting up a new &quot;meta information product&quot;
  &#8211;
  an electronic community of practice&#8217; which would be run by the
  governors themselves in conjunction with the local authority.
  The audit team was a cross section of specialisms from the local
  authority, and the decisions about its composition, plus a bit of good
  luck, ensured that information and knowledge management and
  information design had a leading role. The two project managers were
  information professionals, one the governor-services manager, and
  the other the KM co-ordinator, who combined that work with long
  experience of editing and writing information products in
  collaboration with in-house designers, as manager of the local
  authority&#8217;s education publishing programme.</em></p>
<p><em>
  The team &#8211; which also included a corporate strategist, managers
  from governor services, and representatives of IT, data protection and
  information security &#8211; started by defining, in the light of their varied
  experience, &quot;What Should Be&quot;: what would constitute success in
  supporting school governors with information content that really met
  their needs, and enabling useful exchanges of experience among
  them. The project managers analysed the collective &quot;visual map&quot;
  they
  produced, and identified the key themes that emerged from the many
  contributions posted on it.</em></p>
<p><em>
  They used those to guide them in finding out &quot;What Is&quot; &#8211; the
  actual
  situation as experienced by school governors &#8211; at a series of
  workshops for governors, each of which produced a joint &quot;map&quot; of
  their experiences. The maps revealed a great deal, including the fact
  that this was the first time the local authority had asked governors
  about their experience of the job. Comparison of the results with the
  &quot;What Should Be&quot; analysis led to well founded recommendations for
  the development of the Community of Practice site.</em></p>
<p><em>
  A successor group&#8217; of governors took them over, and spent the next
  school year putting them into practice on a pilot site, working with the
  local authority and its IT partner. Besides material on the website,
  they created a range of print-on-paper information products for
  governors to use in managing information. All the information
  products resulting from the audit, from the first report onwards, were
  properly designed, written in normal human language rather than
  government-management-speak, and visually attractive. The
  Community of Practice went into county-wide operation in the next
  school year and continues to run successfully.</em></p>
<p>The lessons of this story? When LIS, ICT and information design specialisms 
  have a real project, supported by senior management, on which they can collaborate 
  in planning information products, with one another and with the people who will 
  use the products, the users get a product they enjoy using, and TOTO is pleased 
  with the outcome, which is good for the reputation of the LIS and design professionals!</p>
<h2>Overcoming the obstacles</h2>
<p>With that story in mind, let us now go back to the obstacles to constructive 
  interdisciplinary conversation, and consider ways of overcoming them. Reflecting 
  on the experience, it seems to represent some first steps towards the &quot;sense-making&quot; 
  that Brenda Dervin has pursued for many years. A recent article of hers (Dervin 
  et al. <a href="#der06">2006</a>) actually discusses communication among three 
  professional groups who share common ground but without much awareness of it 
  (LIS, Human/Computer Interaction and Communication), so it makes an opportune 
  parallel.</p>
<p>
  In essence it is a vigorous argument for a kind of communication
  based on making bridges through observation and through internal
  communication within ourselves, as well as external communication with
  others; and against the &quot;prevailing polarities&quot;, which arise from
  and
  perpetuate opposing camps and power ideology:</p>
<p>&quot;From a communication standpoint, if we were all deeply anchored in
  observations and communicated with each other through these as a
  major vehicle, we would find ourselves better able to understand each
  other. Talking to each other (and to ourselves) through the haze of
  insulated alien discourses simply is not working. We do not
  understand each other and we do not genuinely understand ourselves.
  Further, our approaches toward each other are too often implemented
  in negative ways. Our communicating strategies seem mostly
  organized around premises of <em>search and destroy</em> ...
  [and] ... the instrumental focus of our organizations usually means
  that <em>play well together</em> too often is implemented by those in power
  as
  <em>play the games we want to play</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>I think that the group from different functions and professional
  disciplines who came together on the governors information audit were
  working towards the kind of communication that Dervin describes in
  these words:</p>

<blockquote>We need to make sense inside ourselves, with the connections
  between where we came from and where we arrived, with the things
  we have figured out and those that are muddles ... When
  communicating with each other we can help each other do this kind of
  sense-making by asking questions that facilitate internal sensemaking</blockquote>

<p>And that helped them to communicate productively with the
  representatives of the users; which in turn allowed the users to take the
  main responsibility for creating the ultimate successful information
  product.</p>
  
<p>Sense-making takes a lot more time than issuing directives from above, but it is time well spent because it&#8217;s a lot more likely to give a good return on the investment &#8211; and while it is a serious business, it can be enjoyable too.</p>

<h2>Opportunities for initiatives</h2>

<p>If I have gone some way to persuading readers that this kind of workplace collaboration 
  is worthwhile, let me now suggest some opportunities for initiatives by LIS 
  professionals who, in the term used by Wang and Swanson (<a href="#wan07">2007</a>), 
  are &quot;institutional entrepreneurs&quot;.</p>
  
<p> The context for the collaboration is: the organization, such information and 
  knowledge strategies as it has, and the stakeholders in its information products 
  &#8211; because it is only within that context that the &quot;unknown&quot; 
  discipline of information design can make its proper contribution.</p>
  
<h2>Auditing information products</h2>

<p>Information products are as yet an unusual theme for information auditing, but taking part in a pioneering audit with that focus has provided evidence that it can work well. An audit focused on a specific set of an organization’s information products would make a good pilot project.</p>

<h2>The publishing end of content management</h2>

<p>Content management, as hinted earlier, is an area crying out for real collaboration 
  in the sense of understanding one another&#8217;s fields of expertise, and seeing 
  how they can work together to make information products do a better job for 
  the organizations that create them, and the people who need to use them to do 
  their work, LIS and ICT professionals and information designers have complementary 
  knowledge and skills that they could bring together to their own benefit and 
  that of the organization. But at the moment, they seem to be either standing 
  back to back on the same ground, each unaware of the other, or wasting energy 
  in boundary disputes.</p>
<p>
  Recent exchanges about content management in the Information
  Design Cafe (infodesign-cafe@list.informationdesign.org; an international
  email discussion list) revealed that many designers have a totally different
  concept of the function of CM than information professionals.
  Fortunately one or two information designers were on hand with enough
  knowledge of information management to do some explaining and
  bridge-building (it would be good if more LIS professionals were patrons
  of the ID Cafe too).</p>
<p> Martin White (<a href="#whi05">2005</a>) in his excellent book on content 
  management observes that content gets the lion's share of attention in software 
  design and purchasing decisions (p26), while the publishing side of it &#8211; 
  ie the information products into which content is put, on which the exchange 
  of knowledge depends &#8211; gets little consideration. His observations that</p>

<blockquote>...implementing a CMS does not mean that the site can be designed
  after the CMS has been installed.&quot; and &quot;Careful consideration must
  be  given at the outset to developing an information architecture that
  meets user requirements, so that appropriate metadata tagging can
  be applied. (p42)</blockquote>
  
<p>
  raise the design implications of information architecture as applied to
  information products, and give scope for sense-making between LIS
  professionals and information designers.</p>
  
<h2>Information architecture and traditional architecture</h2>

<p>Information architecture is indeed another territory to which information designers 
  as well as LIS professionals lay claim &#8211; each apparently unaware of the 
  other&#8217;s assertion of ownership; and here too both have vital knowledge 
  to contribute. We shall get nowhere if this becomes a territorial game of &quot;I 
  saw it first, it's mine; you keep your hands off it!&quot;.</p>
  
<p>
  The Asilomar Institute for Information Architecture definition of the
  concept, which White quotes (p32) could be the basis for some creative
  collaboration:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The structural design of shared information environments</li>
  <li>The art and science of organizing and labelling websites, intranets,
    online communities and software to support usability and
    findability</li>
  <li>An emerging community of practice focused on bringing principles
    of design and architecture to the digital landscape.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is encouraging to know that, in Switzerland, real traditional
  architects are taking an interest in the newer discipline, and using their
  particular visualising skills in their approach to it. A new chair for
  Information Architecture has recently been established in the Swiss
  Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (www.ia.arch.ethz.ch). Its
  elective course on Information Architecture offers lectures on such topics
  as &quot;Architectural Knowledge - Knowledge Architecture&quot; and &quot;Thinking
  with
  your Eyes. Visualizing Strategies&quot;.</p>
<p> One of the people involved in these developments, Remo Burkhard of the Institute 
  for Media and Communication Management (www.mem.unisg.ch), University of St 
  Gallen in Switzerland, is a pioneer of Knowledge Visualisation which he and 
  Martin Eppler (Eppler &amp; Burkhard, <a href="#epp04">2003</a>) define as &quot;The 
  use of visual representations to improve the <em>creation</em> and <em>transfer</em> 
  of knowledge between at least two people. Knowledge visualization thus designates 
  all graphic means that can be used to construct and convey complex insights.&quot;</p>
<p> An architect himself by training, Burkhard (<a href="#bur05a">2005a</a>) argues 
  for collaboration between &quot;real&quot; architects and &quot;information 
  architects&quot; from other disciplines, on the potential of visualisation as 
  a medium for transfer of knowledge, and the integration of non-computer-based 
  methods as &quot;early information visualization proponents, architects, artists, 
  or designers use them&quot; with electronic ones.</p>
<p>
  These developments suggest good opportunities for initiatives by
  information professionals who work in contexts such architecture and
  construction, where visual communication is part of the professional
  equipment.</p>
<h2>Business takes to design</h2>
<p>Business schools and journals dedicated to keeping top management up to date 
  with the latest trends have been taking an interest in design for the past year 
  or so. It seems to be focused on style, &quot;creativity&quot; and &quot;lateral 
  thinking&quot; rather than the more down-to-earth aspects of information design. 
  Some quotes give the flavour: </p>
<blockquote>In an economy where style is king, we all need to start thinking and 
  acting more like designers. Fast Company Issue 93, April 2005, p68</blockquote>
  
<blockquote> The knowledge economy makes all of us designers every day. We need to 
  become more adept at inventing and crafting new solutions to new problems. 
  McGee (<a href="#mcg05">2005</a>) </blockquote>
  
<blockquote>Businesspeople don&#8217;t just need to understand designers better &#8211; 
  they need to become designers. &#8230; traditional organizations must reinvent 
  themselves to perform more like design shops. Roger Martin, dean of Toronto 
  Rotman School of Management (quoted by Breen, <a href="#bre05">2005</a>) </blockquote>
  
<p>'A groundbreaking effort to redesign business education itself.' (Breen, <a href="#bre05">2005</a>) 
  includes a design school for business launched by Stanford University whose 
  aim is memorably expressed by its founder as <br />
  'We want to produce T shaped thinkers …i</p>
  
<p>
  In some circumstances that fashion could make a useful hook on which to
  hang an initiative, but, as David Sless of the Communication Research
  Institute puts it:</p>
  
<blockquote>One of the main characteristics of the current overheated, feverish 
  interest in design is the absence of real evidence ... The big D may turn out 
  to be just another business fashion and die like its predecessors. .... Without 
  this evidence, design with a big D is dead.  Sless (<a href="#sle07a">2007</a>) </blockquote>
  
<p> Information designers have in fact recently been discussing &quot;Achieving 
  Measurable Results&quot; at their 2007 VisionPlus conference (www.iiidvisionplus. 
  net/); there could be scope for collaboration with LIS professionals who have 
  experience of evidence-based practice, to establish the value of well designed 
  information products for communicating essential knowledge.</p>
  
<h2>Bridge-building between library and information science researchers and practitioners</h2>

<p>The gap that separates researchers and practitioners within the LIS professions 
  might be reduced by their participation, along with information designers, in 
  actions suggested by recent research on the subject (Eve &amp; Schenk, <a href="#eve06">2006</a>, 
  <a href="#eve07a">2007a</a> and <a href="#eve07b">b</a>).</p>
  
<p> Topics of the study included identifying what, where, and how practitioners 
  access (or do not access) research output, the networks that researchers and 
  practitioners engage in, and how they contribute to dialogue and collaboration 
  between them.</p>
  
<p> The findings confirmed that practitioners don&#8217;t read academic peer-reviewed 
  journals much. The authors suggest that academics should write for other publications 
  as well, particularly the professional journals read by practitioners. Their 
  report recommends training for academics in writing for a range of audiences, 
  to help where necessary in freeing researchers from the constraints of writing 
  &quot;RAEable papers&#8217; (the solemn and rather indigestible fare that universities 
  in the UK offer to the higher education funding bodies, in the annual Research 
  Assessment Exercise which determines the grant they get for research). For communicating 
  with the wider potential audiences for their research, of whom they are often 
  not fully aware, it is proposed that researchers should be helped by &quot;mediators&quot;. 
  The mediator&#8217;s task suggests that of the &quot;transformer&quot; advocated 
  by Otto von Neurath, the creator of Isotype 1, which is essentially an information-design 
  role.</p>
  
<p> Other recommendations propose joint working and commitment to involve practitioners 
  at all stages of research projects from the outset and during research &#8211; 
  and that could become an opportunity for the kind of interdisciplinary sense-making 
  that Dervin <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#der06">2006</a>) advocate.</p>
  
<h2>Potential benefits?</h2>

<p>Finally I have to make good the promise of the title and set out the
  potential benefits of this inter-professional collaboration. This is what I
  think the parties have to gain.</p>
<h2>Library and information science professionals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bringing information products within the information domain, and so completing 
    the circle of information management</li>
  <li>Incorporating information products and their design into information strategy</li>
  <li>Demonstrating their professional skills and knowledge (including those on 
    measuring the value of information) in applying them to products that are 
    critical for their organizations</li>
  <li>Enhancing their reputation throughout the organization, starting with TOTO.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information and communication technologies professionals</h2>
<p>Most likely to derive benefit and welcome the opportunity are those who
already work with LIS professionals on an equal footing, and accept their
co-operation in developing and managing websites and intranets. Those
who have been accustomed to enjoying total control of the
organization’s electronic information products are not likely to be
overjoyed by the idea of this kind of inter-professional collaboration. In
that case, there is scope for exercise of craft and guile by LIS
professionals, starting with getting the ear of powerful sponsors in
TOTO.</p>
<p>Given the opportunity of sense-making with the other parties in nonthreatening
circumstances, with the active encouragement of
management, and guarantees of full participation in initiatives and
decisions on the organization’s information products, ICT professionals
will in fact benefit from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enhanced standing and appreciation</li>
  <li>Improved communication with colleagues in other functions</li>
  <li>An acknowledged role in developing and implementing organizational
    strategies through the activities described on p &#8230; [14&#8211;15].</li>
</ul>
<h2>Information designers</h2>
<ul>
  <li> A better understanding of the organizational context, and more understanding 
    of users, through the sponsorship of LIS professionals</li>
  <li>More opportunities for exchanges with users</li>
  <li>Increased access to other organizational stakeholders in information products</li>
  <li>Scope for developing effective and integrated design solutions for the organization&#8217;s 
    whole range of information products</li>
  <li>Opportunity to use their full range of skills and knowledge</li>
  <li>Better appreciation by TOTO.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Users</h2>
<ul>
<li>The chance of partnership in developing the information products they need 
  for work</li>
<li>Time-saving, reduced frustration, using working time productively</li>
<li>Increased job satisfaction.&nbsp;</p> </li>
</ul>

 <h2>Organizations</h2>
 
<p>Better value from their information products through:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Saving in-house users&#8217; time (measurable in terms of salary as well 
    as time)</li>
  <li>More productive use of staff time, through being able to devote the maximum 
    proportion of it to using the specialisms for which they are employed</li>
  <li>Reduced frustration from not being able to get readily at the information 
    they need in easily usable forms</li>
  <li>Better retention of staff</li>
  <li>Reduced risk of harm to in-house and external users and others, and of financial 
    and/or reputation loss through their information products</li>
  <li>Increased customer satisfaction with the information products the organization 
    gives them</li>
  <li>Improved return on investment in information products.</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion</p>

<p>Presentations and discussion at CoLIS6 revealed an encouraging amount
of intensive thinking about how humans and today’s ICT can each work
at their best together, and about the interdisciplinary collaborations
which are needed to bring that about.</p>

<p>It is hoped that there will be a place in that thinking for the two
somewhat unfamiliar themes that run through the present paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that encounters between users and information still mainly take
place through the human eye and brain – which do not change at the
same rate as the technology</li>
<li>The argument that better acquaintance and co-operation between LIS
professionals and their little-known information-designer colleagues,
who understand the nature of those encounters, is essential for
productive work, well-being and security – for users and for the
organizations which create information products.</li>
</ul>

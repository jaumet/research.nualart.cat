<blockquote>The disciplinary boundaries of
library and information science and of biomedical informatics are remarkably
similar. Both disciplines deal with data, information, and knowledge and with
their storage, retrieval, and use in the service of society, yet each is rooted
in its own unique sociocultural and historical context. While it is undeniable
that computer technology has substantially influenced both fields, it is the
fundamental principles of information and knowledge organization, storage,
retrieval, and use that provide a common foundation for research and practice
in the two fields. In this comparative survey, representative models and

<h2>Definitions and scope</h2>

<p>The disciplines of information science and biomedical informatics have
followed somewhat different developmental paths over the years but have a great
deal in common. Both deal with information, technology, and people: information
science across all domains, and biomedical informatics within the narrower
domain of biomedical activity. Both make heavy use of information technology,
whose ongoing advances have made it easier to retrieve and combine disparate
types of information in disparate subject areas, thus blurring the lines that
have distinguished the two fields. </p>

<p>In order to appreciate the interrelatedness of the two disciplines as well
as the unique contexts from which they have emerged, it is important to
understand how the terminology used to define these fields has reflected the
underlying process of evolution in the respective disciplines.</p>

<h2>Library science, Library and information science, and Information science </h2>

<p>It would be difficult to define the scope and nature of library information
science without also considering the related terms library science (or librarianship)
and information science. Considerable overlap exists among these terms, and the
distinctions between them have not been universally agreed upon.</p>

<p>According to the American Library Association's Standards for Accreditation 
  of Master's Programs in Library and Information Studies (<a href="#ame92">1992</a>),</p>

<blockquote>The phrase &quot;library and
information studies&quot; is understood to be
concerned with recordable information and knowledge and the
services and technologies to facilitate their management and use.
Library and information studies encompasses information and
knowledge creation, communication, identification, selection,
acquisition, organization and description, storage and retrieval,
preservation, analysis, interpretation, evaluation, synthesis,
dissemination, and management. </blockquote>

<p>In his cogent discussion of librarianship and information science, Buckland 
  (<a href="#buc83">1983</a>) observed more than 20 years ago that our rhetoric 
  concerning these terms is dominated by references to a well-understood institution, 
  the library. However, he also pointed out that librarianship is in fact a subset 
  of information science, sharing many of the same concerns and approaches to 
  information. These two terms came into use together during the era in which 
  computerized information systems began to appear and many of the concepts of 
  library science came to be seen as more broadly applicable to the organization, 
  storage, and retrieval of information in general. From this perspective, information 
  science can therefore be seen as a broader superset because it calls attention 
  to all phases of the information life cycle. </p>

<p>Although the term library and information science is widely used (as for example 
  in the title of this conference), the authors of this paper share Buckland's 
  view (<a href="#buc83">1983</a>) that library science is a subset of information 
  science and will therefore consider the more general field of information science 
  in the present paper. </p>

<p>An early definition of information science was provided by Borko in <a href="#bor68">1968</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Information science is that
discipline that investigates the properties and behaviour of
information, the forces governing the flow of information, and the
means of processing information for optimum accessibility and
usability. It is concerned with that body of knowledge relating
to the origination, collection,organization, storage, retrieval,
interpretation, transmission, transformation, and utilization
of information. </blockquote>

<p>Bates (<a href="#bat99">1999</a>) has further explicated the field of information 
  science by pointing to some of its interesting &quot;below the water line&quot; 
  features, those that are less consciously and explicitly addressed. She has 
  noted that information science, like education and journalism, is a meta-field; 
  that is, it cuts across the conventional academic and content disciplines, offering 
  a particular overarching perspective. Thus, it is interdisciplinary, with ties 
  to a number of other disciplines, including communication and computer science. 
  Key concerns of information science, according to Bates, are the organization 
  of information as well as information seeking and searching processes. </p>

<p>In a recent series of articles, Zins (<a href="#">2007</a>) has reported on 
  a Delphi study entitled &quot;Knowledge Map of Information Science.&quot; This 
  study, conducted in 2003-5, sought input from 57 internationally recognized 
  experts in the field as a means of exploring the foundations of information 
  science. Zins began with an identification of data, information, knowledge, 
  and message as the explored phenomena in information science, then identified 
  six possible models or perspectives (hi-tech, technology, culture/society, human 
  world, living world, and physical world). He reported that most of the panelists 
  associated information science with the culture/society model, suggesting that 
  this field is focused primarily on the mediating aspects of data, information, 
  knowledge, and messages as they are implemented in human societies. </p>

<p>From his research, Zins proposes a ten-faceted hierarchical model, where the
facets are foundations, resources, knowledge workers, contents, applications,
operations and processes, technologies, environments, organizations and users.
The foundations category is described as the metaknowledge of the field and is
further described at the theoretical and conceptual levels. The other
categories are considered the essential body of knowledge in the explored
phenomena, with associated issues and types. Overall, Zins' model suggests the
structure of knowledge in information science and the conceptual relations
among the parts of the field. </p>

<p>Characterizations of information science by the American Society for
Information Science and Technology (ASIS&amp;T) and the recently established
United States I-Schools Project underscore the importance of this mediating
aspect of information science: ASIS&amp;T defines its membership as &quot; information
professionals leading the search for new and better theories, techniques, and
technologies to improve access to information.&quot; (http://www.asis.org/) This
focus on information and technology is expanded in the characterization of the
I-Schools Project as being made up of schools &quot;interested in the relationship
between information, technology, and people.&quot; (http://www.ischools.org/oc/web
site)</p>

<h2>Biomedical informatics </h2>

<p>The beginning of biomedical informatics as a discipline has been associated 
  with the 1959 publication in <em>Science</em> of an article by Ledley and Lusted (<a href="#led59">1959</a>) concerning the reasoning foundations of medical diagnosis. This focus on medical 
  decision making has continued and evolved in bioinformatics, in tandem with 
  computer science and information science. </p>

<p>The discipline of bioinformatics was initially concerned with computer and 
  information technology that focused on medical problems. By the 1980s, however, 
  a more integrated view of medical computing had emerged. Scott Blois (<a href="#blo84">1984</a>), 
  a pioneer in the field, described computing as a &quot;novel research tool&quot; 
  that would do more than merely help us manage information: It would also help 
  us understand the nature of that information and provide support for decision-making 
  in the clinic and laboratory. Originally, the field of biomedical informatics 
  was most often referred to as medical informatics. More recently, subfields 
  of this discipline have emerged n the clinical arena, including subfields of 
  medicine, such as primary care and oncology, together with nursing, dental, 
  and veterinary informatics. In addition, informatics concepts have also come 
  to be applied to other types of health-related data, particularly basic science- 
  and public health-related information. While unanimous agreement has not been 
  achieved with regard to an appropriate name for the overarching discipline, 
  current practice seems to suggest a convergence on the term biomedical informatics, 
  which is the term we will use in this paper. </p>

<p>As has been noted by Perry et al. (<a href="#per05">2005</a>), definitions 
  of health-related informatics over time have reflected the evolving nature of 
  the field: </p>
<ul>
  <li>1977: Medical informatics is the application of computer technology to all 
    fields of medicine &ndash; medical care, medical teaching, and medical research. 
    (Collen, <a href="#col77">1977</a>)</li>
  <li>1984: Medical informatics comprises the theoretical and practical aspects 
    of information processing and communication, based on knowledge and experience 
    derived from process in medical and health care. (van Bemmel, <a href="#van84">1984</a>)</li>
  <li>1990: We define medical informatics as the rapidly developing scientific 
    field that deals with the storage, retrieval and use of biomedical information, 
    data, and knowledge for problem solving and decision making. ( Blois and Shortliffe, 
    <a href="#blo90">1990</a>)</li>
  <li>2006: Biomedical informatics is the scientific field that deals with biomedical 
    information, data and knowledge &ndash; their storage, retrieval and optimal 
    use for problem solving and decision making. (Shortliffe and Cimino, <a href="#sho06">2006</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Another definition of biomedical informatics put forth by Stead in 1998 as a
simplification, but still capturing the essence of the field, is &quot;the science
that deals with health information, its structure, acquisition, and use.&quot; This
definition clearly underscores the fundamental principles that bioinformatics
shares with information science.</p>

<p>Shortliffe and Cimino's <em>Biomedical Informatics</em>, the core textbook
in this field and the source of the 2006 definition above, goes on to note that
the field is &quot;probably best viewed as a basic biomedical science, with a wide
variety of potential areas of application. The analogy with other basic
sciences is that biomedical informatics uses the results of past experience to
understand, structure and encode objective and subjective biomedical findings
and thus to make them suitable for processing. This approach supports the
integration of the findings and their analysis. In turn, the selective
distribution of newly created knowledge can aid patient care, health planning
and basic biomedical research.&quot; </p>

<h2>Similarities and differences between information science and biomedical
informatics</h2>

<p>Although the definitions of both fields have evolved over the years,
information science and biomedical informatics share a focus on information,
technology, and people and on the functions associated with information. Both
define themselves as a science, and both consider themselves to be
multidisciplinary fields. One clear difference between the two disciplines is
that biomedical informatics focuses on the particular domain of biomedicine, while
information science is broader. Other types of informatics are beginning to
emerge, and we expect to see the emergence of informatics in other domain
areas; nevertheless, in this paper we will restrict our discussion to
biomedical informatics. </p>

<h3>Models and methods</h3>

<p>In the view of the authors, the field of information science has been more
explicit than biomedical informatics with regard to identifying models and
theories within the domain. Given the extensive literature in information
science that addresses discipline-specific theory, we will focus first on the
major areas of study included in biomedical informatics, and then comment on
the parallels to information science.</p>

<p>In their textbook, Shortliffe and Cimino <a href="#sho06">2006</a>) provide 
  a comprehensive description of biomedical informatics and then use a structure 
  based on recurrent themes to further explicate this field. Their themes are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the nature and organization of biomedical data</li>
  <li>acquisition, storage and use of biomedical data</li>
  <li>biomedical decision making</li>
  <li>use of biomedical data from a cognitive perspective</li>
  <li>computers in biomedical informatics</li>
  <li>standards in biomedical informatics</li>
  <li>system design and engineering in biomedical informatics</li>
  <li>issues of images in biomedical informatics</li>
  <li>natural language and text processing of biomedical information for information retrieval</li>
</ul>
<p>These themes recur as additional chapters in the book, which describe various 
  types of biomedical information systems and their applications. For example, 
  in the chapter on public health informatics, Yasnoff et al. (<a href="#yas06">2006</a>) 
  suggest that the themes remain similar in this area, but they are set in the 
  specific context of public health; that is, the themes relate to the health 
  of populations rather than that of individuals and to the support of the core 
  public health functions of assessment, policy development, and assurance.</p>

<h3>The nature and types of information involved</h3>

<p>There is an extensive literature in information science that considers that 
  most basic of concepts, the nature of information. Much of the early work in 
  this field is nicely summarized by Blois (<a href="#blo84">1984</a>), who describes 
  the issues of both defining information as a concept and identifying what information 
  does. He notes that concepts of information are employed in many disciplines 
  and in each case relate to their field of origin. </p>

<p>He suggests that the concept of information viewed from a communication
perspective must include elements of a sender, an information channel, a
receiver and a decision maker. He notes Shannon and Weaver's (1949) early identification
of information as a message, or measurable sequence of signals, an approach
that excludes meaning, and the more commonly considered view of information as
transmitting meaning. In discussing what information does, Blois distinguishes
between information and knowledge and the process of human perception that
translates information received into one's personal perceptions. Blois goes on
to discuss Whittemore and Yovits' (1974) view of information as data of value
in decision making, a concept that finds a parallel in the fundamental interest
of biomedical informatics in medical decision making. </p>

<p>The concept of differentiating between data, information, and knowledge is 
  prevalent in both fields. Shortliffe and Cimino (<a href="#sho06">2006</a>), 
  for example, identify a datum as any single observation of fact, and they define 
  knowledge as relationships derived through the analysis of facts. Information 
  is seen as a more generic term that also reflects the organization or analysis 
  of data. Both information science and biomedical informatics concern themselves 
  with a variety of forms of information, including data files, text, and images. 
  Both use the concept of recorded knowledge to define their main area of concern, 
  with biomedical informatics concentrating on patient records, genetic descriptions, 
  public health data sets, and other entities specific to biomedicine. Images 
  are an area of particular interest in biomedical informatics, but they are also 
  increasingly of interest to those in information science.</p>

<h3>Organization of information</h3>

<p>From library cataloging and classification to indexing and thesauri and on
to metadata, the organization of information has been a persistent theme
throughout the history of information science. Similarly, a large number of
vocabularies have been developed within biomedicine that are directly relevant
to biomedical informatics, including vocabularies for the description of
medical research (such as MeSH) and vocabularies describing medical conditions
and treatments (such as SNOMED). The National Library of Medicine (NLM) has
been a leader in the development of medical vocabularies, beginning with
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH), first published in 1954 and then called the
Subject Heading Authority List. More recently, the NLM has created the innovative
<a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/umlsdoc_intro.html" target="_blank">
Unified Medical Language System
</a> (UMLS). Within the UMLS, a metathesaurus serves
as a large, multi-purpose, and multi-lingual vocabulary database that
incorporates a very large number of the medical vocabularies in use around the
world today. Other components of the UMLS are the <a
href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/umlssemn.html">Semantic Network</a>
and the <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/umlslex.html">SPECIALIST
Lexicon</a>.</p>

<h3>The information life cycle</h3>

<p>Both fields make considerable use of the information life cycle as a model 
  for their area of concern. In Shortliffe and Cimino (<a href="#sho06">2006</a>), 
  for example, the life cycle of patient records is portrayed with an eye to the 
  complexity that points to the limitations of paper-based record systems. An 
  example of a life cycle in information science is that described in <a href="#kin81">1981</a>by 
  King et al., who identified the system participants as authors, publishers, 
  libraries and information center, abstracting and indexing services, and users 
  and listed the system functions as research and information generation, composition, 
  recording, reproduction, distribution, acquisition and storage, organization 
  and control, identification and location, physical access, and assimilation 
  by the user. While these functions were articulated more than 25 years ago, 
  it is noteworthy that they continue to represent today's information transfer 
  model. </p>

<h3>Technology</h3>

<p>An interest in computer and networking technology, computer software, and
the standards needed for computing and communication is a predominant
characteristic of both information science and biomedical informatics. Indeed,
both fields have grown to a considerable extent out of the development of
computer technology, and both have benefited from increases in the types of
computer technology available and the ever-growing use of technology for
communication. </p>

<h3>Information retrieval</h3>

<p>A considerable amount of work has been done by information science researchers 
  on information retrieval: that is, on the methods for obtaining the text or 
  documents most relevant to a particular query. This work has involved the exploration 
  of a variety of structures for databases, approaches to describing documents, 
  and mathematical approaches to selection. In biomedical informatics, similar 
  approaches have been applied to biomedicine, for example, as part of the effort 
  to find ways to retrieve information related to disease. The Text REtreival 
  Conference ( <a href="http://trec.nist.gov/">TREC</a> ), which supports information 
  retrieval research by providing the necessary infrastructure for large-scale 
  evaluation, includes a genomic track that looks at retrieval within the broadly 
  construed domain of genomics. </p>

<h3>Information use, including decision making</h3>

<p>Within information science, there has been a considerable emphasis on models 
  and theories of information behaviour. The recent ASIST monograph, <em>Theories 
  of Information Behavior</em>, provides an overview of the many the models and 
  theories in information science (Fisher et al., <a href="#fis05">2005</a>).</p>

<p>Models such as Taylor's information use environment (Palmquist, <a href="#pal05">2005</a>) 
  and Dervin's sense-making (Tidline, <a href="#tid05">2005</a>) provide different 
  perspectives on how individuals identify and seek to meet their information 
  needs. Taylor, whose image of the information use environment recognized that 
  the user's environment or situation has a critical effect on the nature of information 
  needed, has developed some of the earliest models of information use and was 
  a precursor of a number of models focusing on the user's cognitive state. In 
  the case of sense-making, a paradigm that focuses on the user of information 
  and the relationship of communication, information, and meaning for that user 
  has an associated suite of data collection and analysis techniques that can 
  be employed to yield a better understanding of user activities. The latter is 
  an example of how work from the field of communications has also contributed 
  to information science. </p>

<p>While there are relatively few principles, or verified theories, in either 
  field, the area of information use has spawned a few such principles. The principle 
  of least effort, articulated by Zipf (Case, <a href="#cas05">2005</a>) suggests 
  that &quot;in performing tasks, individuals adopt a course of action that will 
  expend the probable least average of their work,&quot; or that &quot;people 
  invest little in seeking information, preferring easy-to-use, accessible sources 
  to sources of known high quality that are less easy to use and/or less accessible.&quot; 
  (Bates, <a href="#bat05">2005</a>) This principle has been found to hold true 
  for many people in many different environments.</p>

<p>There are long traditions of user studies in both biomedical informatics and 
  information sciences. Many of these studies have been based on, or have formulated, 
  the kinds of information use models described above. According to Herbert Poole 
  (<a href="#poo85">1985</a>), the first study of information use was Charles 
  Eliot's article about the used and unused portions of a library's collection. 
  Early studies in general concentrated on channels of information use, especially 
  libraries. </p>

<p>With the growth of science in the 1940s, attention began to turn toward improving 
  dissemination of information from research. Many studies of information use 
  in science were conducted in the 1950s and 1960s, and described both in original 
  articles and in reviews such as those of Menzel (<a href="#men60">1960</a>) 
  and Paisley (<a href="#pai65">1965</a>). In the latter parts of this period, 
  researachers brought in communication-based models and methods, and more attention 
  came to be paid to the information needs of different demographic groups, such 
  as urban residents (Dervin, <a href="#der73">1973</a>) Studies from each of 
  these perspectives - library use, occupational groupings, and demographic groupings 
  &#8211; continue to be conducted, with the American Society for Information 
  Science and Technology's Annual Review of Infomration Science and Technology 
  providing useful summaries, most recently by Case (<a href="#cas06">2006</a>). 
  Case's <em>Information Use</em> (<a href="#cas02">2002</a>) provides a detailed 
  review of many of the user studies carried out in the information science field 
  and the methods they have employed.</p>

<p>Among the earliest of the user studies in biomedical informatics is that of 
  Covell et al. (<a href="#cov85">1985</a>) who used surveys and observation to 
  look at the kinds of information resources employed by physicians in their offices. 
  A striking finding from this study was that only 30% of physicians' information 
  needs were met during the patient's visit. A group of later studies of physicians 
  by Forsythe et al. (<a href="#for92">1992</a>) used an ethnographic approach 
  to directly observe communication about information needs in a university teaching 
  hospital. Gorman (<a href="#gor01">2001</a>) studied the information needs of 
  primary care physicians. Recently studies have focused on the congntive aspects 
  of user behaviour, as in Kushniruk and Patel's (<a href="#kus04">2004</a>) work 
  on the impact of a computer-based patient record on physician's information 
  gathering and reasoning strategies.</p>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>Bates (<a href="#bat05">2005</a>) has described the information science approach 
  to methods: &quot;The fundamental methodological stance of information science 
  can be described as socio-technical. The two most important methodological traditions 
  that we draw on are the social sciences and the engineering sciences.&quot; 
  She goes on to note that information science addresses three large-scale questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the features and laws of the recorded-information universe?</li>
  <li> How do people relate to, seek, and use information?</li>
  <li>How can access to recorded information be made most rapid and effective? </li>
</ul>
<p>The methods most commonly used in addressing these question are statistical
and other, philosophically based. analytic techniques for the first question,
social science techniques for the second, and engineering techniques for the
third.</p>

<p>Both fields make considerable use of systems analysis techniques in the conduct 
  of their research and development activities. In recent years there has been 
  an increasing emphasis on an expansive view of the information system, including 
  producers, distributors, and users of information, and on a holistic view of 
  activity within this system, taking into account all factors. Evidence of this 
  general approach in biomedical informatics can be found in Friedman and Wyatt 
  (<a href="#fri06">2006</a>) and in Brender (<a href="#bre06">2006</a>). A noteworthy 
  study in the area is the 7-year qualitative study by Ash et al. (<a href="#ash05">2005</a>) 
  regarding computerized physician order entry implementation at successful sites.</p>

<p>Another methodology frequently called upon in both fields is the usability 
  study, which seeks to determine the ease with which people can use a particular 
  tool, particularly a computerized tool, to achieve a goal. Here, the early work 
  was done primarily within information science, by researchers such as Shneiderman 
  (<a href="#shn04">2004</a>). More recently, a number of usability studies have 
  been done in biomedical informatics, as for example the study by Starren et 
  al. (<a href="#sta06">2006</a>) concerning clinical trial management systems. 
  Certainly the importance of such studies is likely to increase in both fields, 
  as information tasks become more complex and the computer techniques available 
  to increase usability become increasingly sophisticated.</p>

<p>Evaluation methods in biomedical informatics have grown out of the medical 
  tradition of evolutionary assessment, as in the case of drug trials, which proceed 
  from case studies to rigorous quantitative analysis and then randomized controlled 
  trials (Friedman, <a href="#fri06">2006</a>). In contrast, evaluation methods 
  in information science have taken a more social science-oriented approach, using 
  exploratory techniques such as case studies, observation, and interviews . </p>

<h3>Training in information science and biomedical informatics</h3>

<p>In essence, training in both fields began with the apprentice model, as has
been true for many other professions. Early training of librarians took place
in libraries but moved to to the university setting over a hundred years ago.
As library science expanded to the broader field of information science, many
of the same schools began to offer programmes in both library and information
science or a combination of the two. Other cognate fields also embraced the
emerging discipline of information science, with expansions of programmes in
their areas, such as computer science, communications, and business. Today a
wide array of degrees are available in library information science and in
information science, with an emphasis on the master's level degree. </p>

<p>Early training in biomedical informatics took place in the laboratories or
clinical settings of the first workers in the field, who were predominantly
physicians. Generally the model followed was the post-doctoral or fellowship
approach that is characteristic of advanced training in many areas of medicine.
As this field grew, and as more basic principles and methods were identified,
training came to include more formal coursework. Degrees were added, again
focusing on the master's degree.</p>

<p>Schools providing training in information science in the United States include
a number of schools that began with a focus on librarianship. Many, but not
all, of these have programmes in librarianship accredited by the American Library
Association's Committee on Accreditation. A nexus for programmes that identify
their primary focus as information is the recently formed I Schools caucus ( <a
href="http://www.ischools.org/">http://www.ischools.org/</a> ). Several of
these schools have their origins in programmes of computer science, but at least
two &#8211; Indiana University's School of Information and Pennsylvania State
University's College of Information Science and Technology &#8211; have recently been
created to address the broad area of information science.</p>

<p>Training in biomedical informatics has benefited greatly from <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/ep/GrantTrainInstitute.html">funding from 
  the NLM</a> , which has funded a number of programmes for over 20 years. The largest of these programmes includes 20 schools that provide training either 
  across biomedical informatics or in more specific subareas, such as imaging 
  informatics. There are a number of educational programmes in nursing informatics, 
  and certification as an informatics nurse is available through the <a href="http://nursingworld.org/">American Nurses Association</a>. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation has recently partnered with NLM to fund 
  four institutions to create training programmes in public health informatics. 
  There seems to be an increasing amount of education in the bioinformatics area, 
  with a number of academic institutions announcing new degree programmes in this 
  area. </p>

<p>Is there convergence in this array of educational programmes in the two
fields? At this point, the most observable activity is the increased
coordination of separate programmes in universities having multiple offerings,
for example those at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of
Washington. The formation of broader-based programmes, such as that at the
University of Indiana (http://www.informatics.indiana.edu/), may be a harbinger
of more to come.</p>

<h3>Professional organizations and accreditation agencies</h3>

<p>As in other disciplines, there are a number of professional organizations
that represent the individuals and organizations involved in information
science and biomedical informatics. Key organizations in the US in the general
information science field include the American Library Association
(http://www.ala.org/) and the American Society for Information Science and
Technology (<a href="http://www.asis.org/" target="_blank">ASIST</a>;).
Educational associations include the <a href="http://www.alise.org/" target="_blank">
Association for Library and Information Science Education </a> and the <a href="http://www.ischools.org/oc/" target="_blank">I-Schools consortium</a>. In biomedical informatics, the primary
professional organization for academics is the American Medical Informatics
Association (AMIA), with the <a href="http://www.himss.org/ASP/index.asp">Healthcare
Information and Management Systems Society</a> being the professional home for
many practitioners in the field. AMIA has recently established an academic
forum to promote the development of biomedical informatics as an academic
discipline by identifying best practices and serving as a locus for
collaborative activities among its members. </p>

<p>Accreditation of educational programmes in a professional discipline reflects
an agreed-upon set of standards for the training of individuals in the field,
including specification of the values of the discipline and the basic competencies
that identify a professional in the field. Such processes are generally carried
out through the professional association in the field. </p>

<p>Accreditation of information science programmes is currently carried out by
the American Library Association, with the scope of the accreditation
activities evolving to some extent as schools of library science have evolved
into schools of library and information science. The process remains mainly
focused on programmes leading to degrees in librarianship or combined library and
information science degrees. A few schools that provide separate library and
information science degrees also submit their information science programmemes for
accreditation. In the context of a world view in which library science is a
subset of information science, this approach amounts to a broadening of the
field and the scope of ALA's accreditation programme. Alternately, when
information science is viewed as separate from library science, ALA's
accreditation process is inadequate to define education in the field. </p>

<p>Accreditation processes in medicine are well established and cover a variety
of subdisciplines, but there is no programme for accreditation of biomedical
informatics programmes. AMIA's recent creation of an academic forum for the
exchange of information among programmes offering degrees in biomedical
informatics suggests a maturing of the field, and one of the items of interest
for the academic forum is the consideration of an accreditation programme. </p>

<p>The parallelism here is that both biomedical informatics and information
science, broadly defined, can be said to be at a developmental stage at which
it is appropriate to consider accreditation programmes as well as other signposts
of an established discipline. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The notable convergence of biomedical informatics with library and
information science in recent years is a direct reflection of the common
foundation of these two disciplines, both of which are focused on the
organization, storage, retrieval, and application of data, information, and knowledge.
Despite the fact that these information-focused areas have emerged from
different sociocultural and historical backgrounds, the boundaries between the
two fields continue to blur, and there is clearly potential for beneficial
cross-fertilization in the future. </p>

<p>Both biomedical informatics and information science are multidisciplinary,
drawing on many of the same domains of knowledge, including philosophy,
psychology, computer science, and communications. Both fields are also
meta-fields, cutting across conventional academic or content disciplines from
the information perspective.</p>

<p>These two fields clearly exhibit a considerable number of parallels,
particularly with regard to their development, the approaches followed, and the
discoveries that have been made. There are also some parallels in their
approaches to training new professionals in their respective fields, and some
indication of collaboration in this arena.</p>

<p>We suggest that a continued exploration of the parallels between these two
information-based fields, begun in the present paper, will allow each field to
benefit from the other. Particularly useful areas of collaboration include the
sharing of research findings and methods, identification of basic theories and
models, and delineation of competencies and training approaches. </p>

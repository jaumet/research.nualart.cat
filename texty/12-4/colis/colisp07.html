<meta content="Introduction. The European Commission is one of the most important players in the EU policy-making process. There are numerous studies on the Commission's roles, structure and policies, however little has been written on its role as an information gatherer and processor. This PhD research project aims to develop a conceptual information processing framework for that part of the EU policy-making process involving the Commission.
Method. An inductive process of theory building from case studies is adopted. The study examines three case studies: a regulatory, an Open Method of Coordination, and a non-regulatory case study. The main bulk of data was collected through elite interviewing, primary documentation analysis and participant observation.
Analysis. The emerging data from the data collection have been analysed and further processed using the coding technique within- and cross-case in order a conceptual framework to be developed.
Results. The most prominent results from the analysis of the empirical data are that information flows reflect the organizational structure and the procedures of the Commission. Information used for policy-making may be formal/informal, internal/external, written/oral, electronic/paper-based. Formal procedures anticipate possible conflicts or opposing policy priorities and facilitate information flows and decision-making. Information needs vary according to the seniority of policy-makers in the hierarchy. In all cases, the Commission does not experience any information accessibility problems.
Conclusions The characterization of the Commission as a 'complex multi-organization' is also supported from the information flow analysis. Information and its management play a significant role in understanding policy- and decision-making in the EU." name="dc.description" />

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Policy-making goes beyond making formal decisions or proposals.
It entails the gathering and exchange of information, the elaboration of alternatives
and their expected consequences, and experiential learning
(<a href="#mar76">
March and Olsen, 1976, p. 144</a>, <a href="#sim76">Simon, 1976</a>, <a href="#ege99">Egeberg, 1999</a>).
For an organisation like the European Commission (hereafter 'the
Commission'), the role of information is vital to the efficacious
performance of its key functions and roles in the EU and international
arena. Feldman and March (<a href="#fel81">1981</a>)
argued that, &#8220;<em>using information, asking for information, and justifying decisions in terms of
information have all come to be significant ways in which we symbolize that the process is legitimate,
that we are good decision makers, and that our organizations are well managed</em>&#8221; (p. 178).
Although there is a common consent that, information is one of the key drivers in the policy process
of the Commission (<a href="#eur01">European Commission, 2001</a>), as yet there is little research on the role of the Commission as an information gatherer,
information user and information provider in the EU policy-making process. </p>

<p>This is the background against which this study aims to accomplish the
following objectives: the identification and categorization of the different
information types and activities in the Commission&#8217;s policy-making processes; the identification and
analysis of the information needs of the Commission&#8217;s policy makers as policy-making processes unfold,
and the development of a conceptual information processing framework for that part of the EU policy-making process
 involving the Commission.</p>

<h2>Method</h2>

<p>Because of the exploratory nature of the study and the objective of identifying the
different information activities and developing an analytical framework, an inductive process
of theory building from case study research is adopted.[i]   The process of inducting theory using
case studies synthesizes elements of Glaser and Strauss&#8217; (<a href="#gla1967">1967</a>)  grounded theory, the design of the
case study research (<a href="#yin89">Yin, 1989</a>), and work on qualitative methods (<a href="#mil94">Miles and Huberman, 1994</a>,<a href="#eis89">Eisenhardt, 1989</a> ).</p>

<p>The main arguments for choosing case studies as the research strategy were the
descriptive nature of the research (not focusing on information seeking behaviours but rather documenting information flows
and processes)
and the dominance of &#8220;how&#8221; (and exploratory &#8220;what&#8221;) questions.
Given the weaknesses of the single case study (<a href="#yin89">Yin, 1989</a>), this research adopted an embedded multi-case study
design. In particular, it examines three policy cases: a) a regulatory case, the Safety of Toys directive; b)
an open method of coordination (OMC) case, Innovation policy, and c) a non-regulatory case, the Corporate Social
Responsibility initiative. The selection criteria are based on theoretical sampling (<a href="#gla67">Glaser and Strauss, 1967</a>).
The empirical part of the study is informed by twenty
semi-structured interviews with Commission officials. It also analyses published and unpublished primary
 documentation and draws from participant observation during the researcher&#8217;s internship in the Commission
(DG Enterprise and Industry, March-July 2006).[iii]</p>




<h2>Analysis: Preliminary Conceptual Framework</h2>

<p>Data analysis applies the coding technique in order to categorize
the primary data. The coding process was inductive and used the
following steps: initial reading of the data; identification of
specific segments; labelling of data to create categories; reduction of
overlapping categories, and the creation of a model encompassing the
most important categories (<a href="#cres02">Creswell, 2002</a>). According to Miles and Huberman (<a href="#mil94">1994</a>), conceptual frameworks are the current version of
the researcher&#8217;s map of the territory being investigated. They also stated that conceptual frameworks
are best done graphically so as to enable the researcher to make explicit what is already in his/her mind.
The preliminary framework of this study applies the stages of the policy cycle and the information cycle to
 describe information flows within the Commission. In addition, it shows that there is an intra- and
extra-Commission context. </p>

<p>The policy cycle includes the following stages:
agenda setting; policy formulation, policy defending and project development;
decision-making; policy implementation and policy evaluation (<a href="#cin96">adapted from Cini, 1996</a>).
On the other hand, the information cycle initiates by determining information requirements, capturing,
distributing and (re-)using information (<a href="#dav97">adapted from Davenport, 1997</a>).</p>

<p> The mechanisms and processes applied by the Commission to gather and use information 
  for policy-making may range from the Internet to group meetings and direct contacts, 
  information systems, special reports and determined by the annual planning and 
  formal internal rules and procedures. Within the Commission, information flow 
  is top-down and bottom-up in two levels: intra-Directorates-General/cabinets 
  level and inter-Directorates-General/cabinets level. Outside the Commission 
  boundaries information may originate from other EU institutions (for instance, 
  the European Council, the European Parliament etc) or from the civil society 
  at large, which may be expert advice, national, regional and local governments, 
  target groups, key networks and individuals. </p>

  information and policy cycles</strong></div>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The most significant results from the analysis of the empirical data are that information
flows reflect the organizational structure and the procedures of the Commission.
Even in the cases where the policy priorities of the involved DGs are opposing or conflicting and
information flows are disrupted in day-to-day activities, there are formal procedures that smooth the progress
of information exchange and decision-making. On the other hand, the decentralization of the Commission&#8217;s information
systems
impedes the follow-up of policies within the various Commission services involved.
In respect of the information needs of the Commission&#8217;s policy makers there are two main findings:
a) information needs vary according to the level of policy-makers in the hierarchy,
b) the Commission does not experience any information accessibility problems. If the information
is available they have access to it; the Internet plays a vital role in accessing and using information. </p>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The characterization of the Commission as a 'complex multi-organization' (<a href="#cra94">
  Cram, 1994)</a> is also supported from the information flow analysis. Policy-
  and decision-making are the outcomes of continuous information gathering, processing
  and (re-)use. A better understanding of the way information is accumulated,
  organized and used plays a vital role in the whole process of policy- and decision-making
  and enhances the openness and transparency of the EU polity. <br />

<h2>Footnotes</h2>

  [i] <a href="#tor97">Torraco</a> (1997, p. 115) noted that theory &#8220;simply
explains what a phenomenon is and how it works&#8221;.<br />
[ii] The main procedures of OMC are: common guidelines to be translated into national
policy, combined with periodic monitoring, evaluation and peer review organized
as mutual learning processes and accompanied by indicators and benchmarks as means
of comparing best practice (<a href="#cou00">European Council, 2000, p. 12</a>).<br />
[iii] The researcher experienced a five-month in-service training at the Commission
that enabled her to gain a better understanding of the way the Commission operates.<br />

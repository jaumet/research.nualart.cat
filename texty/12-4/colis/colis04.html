<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The 1986 <em>Annual Review of Information Science and Technology (ARIST)</em> 
  review article, &quot;Information Needs and Uses,&quot; written by Brenda Dervin 
  and Michael Nilan, argued for a radical reconceptualization of the information 
  needs and uses research area. Dervin and Nilan (<a href="#der06">1986</a>) in 
  fact called for a comprehensive shift away from the traditional paradigm that 
  guides <em>information science</em> research. Dervin and Nilan's call for a 
  paradigm shift was to become the most cited article in the information behaviour 
  research community (<a href="#whi01">White and McCain 1998</a>). </p>
<p>Dervin and Nilan's seminal article is quite often cited as the turning point 
  that led away from the study of users categorized and analysed according to 
  systems features and variables towards a more holistic study of users from the 
  viewpoint of users. In a summary of the contributions of the first Information 
  Seeking in Context conference, Pertti Vakkari (<a href="#vak01">1997</a>) noted 
  how a qualitative grounded-theory influenced research approach focusing on contextual 
  aspects of the user's situation had, almost entirely, replaced quantitative 
  studies and earlier metatheories: <br />
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The old system-centred paradigm is metaphorically speaking water under the 
    bridge. A person-in-situation or action-centred metatheory has replaced it. 
    In that way the directives put forward in the article by Dervin and Nilan 
    ten years ago have been realized. (<a href="#vak01">Vakkari 1997</a>: 463) 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a comprehensive book on information seeking, needs and behaviour research, 
  Donald Case (<a href="#cas01">2002</a>) dates the beginning of the paradigm 
  shift to early 1970s, and especially to the <a href="#der01">1976</a> landmark 
  article by Dervin that challenged ten &quot;dubious assumptions&quot; that had 
  dominated past research on information needs and uses. According to Case:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>It was not until the 1970s that investigations begin to branch out beyond 
    the focus on formal channels and task-oriented needs. The emphasis shifted 
    away from the structured &quot;information system&quot; and toward the person 
    as finder, creator, and user of information. (<a href="cas01html.html">Case 2002</a>: 
    6)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A yet different view on the origin and history of user-centred research was 
  presented in 2004 by Marcia Bates. In her memoirs of the early formulative phase 
  of information science in the 1960s, Bates wrote that</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Many writers (...) cite Dervin and Nilan's 1986 literature review on information 
    seeking as marking, essentially, the beginning of a modern user-centred orientation 
    to information-seeking research. I have long been puzzled by this apparent 
    blanking out of the rich body of information behaviour research by Paisley 
    and many other excellent researchers (...) (<a href="#bat05">Bates 2004</a>: 
    692)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bates (<a href="#bat05">2004</a>) hence placed the beginning of user-centred 
  research to the studies on scholarly communication conducted in the 1950s and 
  1960s. In Case's (<a href="#cas01">2002:</a> 6) view, this older literature 
  was not really about information seeking but artifacts and venues of information 
  seeking. It focused on information sources and how they were used, rather than 
  the individual users and their needs.</p>
<p>In the light of the variability of views concerning the history of user-centred 
  research, there is clearly a need to revisit the user-centred turn. This article 
  looks more closely into a sample of early user studies in the light of the characterization 
  of those studies as system-centred. We seek to convey some of the meanings 
  and interpretations given to information systems, information sources, and information 
  activities, in different decades. </p>
<p>In addition to the original works that we were able to access, we rely on early 
  reviews of user studies written by Bates (<a href="#bat01">1971</a>, <a href="#bat02">1973</a>), 
  Menzel (<a href="#men01">1960</a>, <a href="#men02">1966</a>), Paisley and Parker 
  (<a href="#par01">1966</a>) and Paisley (<a href="#pai01">1968</a>) that appear 
  to be fairly comprehensive. The reviews naturally represent the viewpoint of 
  the time in which they were written, however, this is exactly what we want to 
  capture and compare to the interpretative context set by Dervin and Nilan's characterization 
  of traditional user research. </p>
<p>The article proceeds by first introducing Dervin and Nilan's major arguments. 
  We then discuss the historical context of the Dervin and Nilan article. Then 
  we revisit the dichotomies presented by Dervin and Nilan by comparing them to 
  ideas presented in the sources mentioned above. The article ends by presenting 
  our conclusions.</p>
<h2>Characteristics of traditional user and use studies according to Dervin and 
  Nilan</h2>
<p>According to Dervin and Nilan (<a href="#der06">1986</a>: 10), traditional 
  use and user studies primarily focused on individuals' use of information sources 
  and their sociodemographic characteristics. Traditional studies mainly addressed 
  questions such as &quot;how often is system X used and by whom?&quot; focusing 
  on observable dimensions of behaviour (<a href="#der06">ibid.</a>: 10). Dervin 
  and Nilan argued that traditional use and user studies constructed users mainly 
  as passive and essentially homogeneous recipients of information (ibid.: 13). 
</p>
<p>Dervin and Nilan (<a href="#der06">1986</a>) proposed a range of characteristics 
  for a new alternative user-centred paradigm that were cast as contrasts to 
  the features of the traditional approach. The contrasts outlined by Dervin and 
  Nilan were:</p>
  <ol>
<li>Objective versus Subjective Information. Traditional information needs and 
  uses studies focused on objective information, that is, constructed &quot;information&quot; 
  mainly as something that has some element of correspondence to reality. The 
  alternative paradigm focuses on the uniqueness of the life-worlds of users who 
  are constructed as actively seeking and making sense of information (<a href="#der06">Dervin 
  and Nilan 1986</a>: 13).</li>
<li>Mechanistic, Passive versus Constructivist, Active Users. Traditional user 
  studies assumed that all information, document delivery and information system 
  use is beneficial,&quot;ignoring the strategies that people actually use for 
  bridging their information needs&quot; (<a href="#der06">Dervin and Nilan 1986</a>: 
  13-14). The user-centred approach focuses on questions such as &quot;how do 
  people define needs in different situations?&quot; (<a href="#der06">ibid.</a>: 
  16).</li>
<li>Trans-Situationality versus Situationality. Traditional studies attempted 
  to describe elements of user behaviour that apply to all users across situations. 
  There are few conceptual approaches dealing with situational variables. The 
  situationality focus requires systems to make repetitive needs assessments <a href="#der06">(ibid.</a>:. 
  14).</li>
<li>Atomistic versus Holistic Views of Experience. Traditional studies focused 
  on user behaviour primarily in the context of user intersection with systems. 
  The alternative paradigm calls for looking at information behaviours outside 
  system contexts (<a href="#der06">ibid.</a>: 14)</li>
<li>External behaviour versus Internal Cognitions. Traditional research focused 
  on contacts with sources and systems as observable indicators of needs whereas 
  the alternative approach sees information needs as internal, psychological, 
  cognitive states (<a href="#der06">ibid</a>.: 15).</li>
<li>Chaotic versus Systematic Individuality. Traditional studies considered 
  it necessary to base systems and observations on orderly patterns of behaviour 
  whereas the alternative paradigm argues for the right of the user to be different 
  (<a href="#der06">ibid.</a>: 15).</li>
<li>Qualitative versus Quantitative Research. Quantitative techniques were the 
  most compatible with traditional assumptions whereas the alternative paradigm 
  seeks to supplement these with inductive qualitative approaches (<a href="#der06">ibid.</a>:. 
  16).</li>
  </ol>
<h2>The historical context of the Dervin and Nilan review</h2>
<p>As noted by Bates (<a href="bat05html.html">2004</a>: 691), descriptions of the evolution 
  of the information behaviour research generally lean towards accepting the interpretation 
  of the de-contextualized and system-centred nature of traditional information 
  needs and uses studies. She pointed out that Dervin and Nilan <em>had reviewed 
  the literature from the year 1978 forward only</em>, as that was the date of 
  the preceding ARIST review on information needs and uses literature. This seems, 
  by and large, to have gone unnoticed (<a href="#bat05">Bates 2004</a>), and 
  the effects of this time limit on Dervin and Nilan's interpretations have not 
  been discussed in an in-depth manner in earlier work.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is that Dervin's own research had focused on 
  public library users and everyday information needs of general population adults 
  (<a href="#der02">Dervin 1976b</a>, <a href="#der07">Dervin and Zweizig 1977</a>). 
  It is in this particular context that she advocated the idea that the library 
  should not be the central object of study in itself, but information needs as 
  they are experienced and faced by individuals in diverse life situations. In 
  fact, Dervin's analysis of alternative conceptualizations of information and 
  users originally encompassed a wide scope of literatures. It was developed as 
  a critique of &quot;social science literature relating to information transfer&quot; 
  (<a href="#der04">Dervin 1983a</a>: 160). Dervin discussed and analysed, for 
  instance, the positioning of audiences in mass media research and public opinion 
  studies.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the Dervin and Nilan <a href="#der06">1986</a> ARIST call 
  to arms incorporated major critical insights from other articles similarly aiming 
  at strengthening the conceptual and theoretical foundations of information science. 
  Some of the leading theorists cited by Dervin and Nilan were Dervin (<a href="#der03">1980</a>, 
  <a href="#der05">1983b</a>), Zweizig (<a href="#zwe01">1976</a>, <a href="#zwe02">1979</a>), 
  Belkin (<a href="#bel01">1978</a>), Jarvelin and Repo (<a href="#jar01">1982</a>), 
  Taylor (<a href="#tay01">1984</a>), and Wilson (<a href="#wil01">1981</a>, <a href="#wil02">1984</a>). 
  Dervin and Nilan (<a href="#der06">1986</a>: 9) explicitly state that they derived 
  their context of looking at information needs and uses literature from this 
  body of research expressing an ambition of developing a better general theory 
  for the study of information-related human behaviour. They commented that without 
  this context, it would have been difficult to make sense of the literature because</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>On the one hand, <em>the brunt of the work looks much like work reviewed 
    in prior ARIST chapters</em>. On the other, a small but significant portion 
    of the work is going off in seemingly unrelated directions. (<a href="#der06">Dervin 
    and Nilan 1986</a>: 9; italics added). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is noteworthy that many of the best works in the period reviewed by Dervin 
  and Nilan were influenced by theories of cognitive psychology (also called mental 
  constructivism in distinction to social constructivism, (<a href="#tal01">Talja 
  <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>). This was the strongest theoretical movement at that 
  time, allowing scholars to develop a theoretical foundation for the study of 
  human information processing by shifting attention to cognitive knowledge structures 
  and how meanings and what constitutes &quot;information&quot; is relative to 
  particular situations. Dervin and Nilan were similarly more interested in the 
  conceptualization of information at the level of metatheory than the history 
  of information needs and uses research. They wanted to tackle underlying philosophical 
  background assumptions about the nature of reality, knowledge, information and 
  human beings. Dervin continued this research track in her later publications, 
  resulting in some of the strongest theoretical work in the field of information 
  studies.</p>
<h2>Conceptualizations of context</h2>
<p>Dervin and Nilan called for a focus on contextual aspects of users' situations. 
  As noted by Dalrymple (<a href="#dal01">2001</a>), Paisley's <a href="#pai01">1968</a> 
  <em>ARIST</em> review developed a sophisticated conceptualization of the layers 
  of context or foci through which to study scholarly communication. These were: 
  1) the scientist within his culture, 2) the scientist within a political system, 
  3) the scientist within a membership group, 4) the scientist within a reference 
  group, 5) the scientist within an invisible college, 6) the scientist within 
  a formal organization, 7) the scientist within a work team, 8) the scientist 
  within his own head, 9) the scientist within a legal/economic system, 10) the 
  scientist within a formal information system. The first nine layers definitely 
  &quot;go beyond the system intersection&quot; and are concerned with &quot;what 
  leads up to intersections with systems&quot; (<a href="#der06">Dervin and Nilan 
  1986</a>: 15). <a href="#der06">Dervin and Nilan</a> (1986: 17) argued, however, 
  that &quot;almost without exception &quot;information needs&quot; have not been 
  defined as what users think they need but rather in terms that designate what 
  it is in the information system that is needed.&quot;</p>
<p>It is interesting to look at the topics that Paisley (<a href="#pai01">1968</a>) 
  outlined as relevant for each of the ten layers in the light of this argument. 
  For instance, Paisley noted that affective and psychological factors belong 
  to the layer &quot;scientists within his own head&quot; but he then went on 
  to review studies on the &quot;curious filtering process&quot; revealed by studies 
  on <em>perceived relevance</em>. Citing Cuadra and Katter (<a href="#cua01">1967</a>) 
  he wrote that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The authors' discussion on the <em>situation-specific</em> &quot;preferential 
    discriminatory response&quot; (...) shows that we have made progress since 
    the days when relevance was thought to be a property of documents. In fact, 
    Cuadra and Katter have opened up a Pandora's box of relationships among judges, 
    needs, documents, situations, and scales that may temporarily discourage the 
    use of the relevance crition in system precision. (<a href="#pai01">Paisley 
    1968</a>: 8; italics added)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A major finding as summarized by Paisley (<a href="#pai01">1968</a>) was that 
  &quot;information acceptances&quot; and preferred aspects of relevance - interpretative, 
  methodological, formulative, &quot;loose-metaphor orientation,&quot; &quot;hard-fact 
  orientation&quot; - seemed to be explained by group membership and research 
  phase, and not by individual characteristics.</p>
<p>Paisley's (<a href="#pai01">1968</a>) work is interesting also because he stressed 
  that the effects of the cultural system of science are so pervasive that they 
  are easily overlooked even by scholars themselves. Into the cultural system 
  he not only counted the traditions of scholarly communities but also technology. 
  Interpreted in contemporary terms, he did not see technology as a stand-alone 
  system but as both shaping and being shaped by scholarly information and communication 
  practices. Vis-a-vis information systems Paisley (<a href="#pai01">1968:</a> 
  6) did not adopt a system-centred view but explicitly stated that there exists 
  a marketplace of <em>competing</em> information systems so that &quot;much like 
  commercial air service, a network coalesces from competitive elements.&quot;</p>
<p>In the same way as Dervin and Nilan, Parker and Paisley (<a href="#par01">1966</a>) 
  emphasized the need for psychological research into the nature of human information 
  seeking and information-processing behaviour. What is different in their approach 
  is that they do not call for more research on users' cognitive and psychological 
  processes to build a general theory, but explicitly state that </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The task for psychological research in this context is to test the behavioural 
    assumptions of systems designers. (<a href="#par01">Parker and Paisley 1966</a>: 
    1069)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Parker and Paisley saw the role of psychological research of human information 
  processing as &quot;providing explicit specifications and constraints for the 
  design of information systems&quot; (<a href="#par01">Parker and Paisley 1966</a>: 
  1069). </p>
<p>They stressed that information systems design for amplifying the efficient 
  flow of information among scientists entails dealing with a great deal of &quot;<em>apparent</em> 
  irrationality&quot; on the part of scholars because such apparent irrationality 
  nevertheless results in overall efficiency and productivity (<a href="#par01">Parker 
  and Paisley</a>: 1069). Along similar lines, Scott (<a href="#sco01">1959</a>: 
  245) stated that &quot;we had better take the scientist broadly as we find him 
  and build our system of information storage around him.&quot; Swanson (<a href="#swa03">1966:</a> 
  80) stressed that &quot;we should (...) get on with the job of trying to change 
  the services, not the customers.&quot; Swanson (<a href="#swa03">1966</a>: 83) 
  suggested that a good line to take in designing better systems is the &quot;systemic 
  large-scale amplification of information activities already found to be useful 
  by scientists themselves;&quot; the &quot;informal and haphazard information 
  activities.&quot;</p>
<p>Although this user-centred design viewpoint was not consistent in early scholarly 
  communication studies (<a href="#bat01">Bates 1971</a>), it in fact predates 
  even the many fine papers presented in the 1958 International Conference on 
  Scientific Information (ICSI). Swank (<a href="#swa01">1945</a>) studied the 
  needs of English scholars analysing the topics and subjects they studied through 
  a corpus of doctoral dissertations. His interest was in &quot;whether the required 
  materials are brought together under headings relevant for English scholars' 
  needs,&quot; defining the rationale for his research as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>This study is a criticism, from the point of view of the English scholar, 
    of bibliographical devices which are, or can be, used for revelatory purposes. 
    (<a href="#swa01">Swank 1945</a>: 50)</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Conceptualizations of systems</h2>
<p>As noted by Bates (<a href="#bat05">2004:</a> 691), the seminal articles by, 
  for instance, Menzel (<a href="#men01">1959</a>, <a href="#men02">1960</a>) 
  and Parker and Paisley (<a href="#par01">1966</a>) employ the term &quot;systems&quot; 
  in a very different sense than information retrieval systems or library-centred 
  studies. The word &quot;system&quot; in these studies refers to &quot;<em>systems 
  of scientific communication</em>,&quot; that is, scholarly communication practices. 
  These were studied quite consistently in their social and scholarly domain contexts. 
  As pointed out by Menzel (<a href="#men02">1960</a>: 1), the range of topics 
  studied was really much wider than conveyed by the umbrella term &quot;information 
  needs and uses.&quot; The fundamental questions tackled in these early studies 
  were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>given that a scholar has to perform such and such a task, how does he go 
    about performing it? (<a href="#men02">Menzel 1960</a>)</li>
  <li>how do scientists actually learn about work important to them? (<a href="#par01">Parker 
    and Paisley 1966</a>)</li>
  <li>on what grounds do researchers choose literature? (<a href="#all01">Allen 
    and Gerstberger 1967</a>)</li>
  <li>what is the range of literatures used? (<a href="#met01">Metz 1983</a>)</li>
  <li>how can the total scientific communication process be aided and amplified? 
    (<a href="#swa02">Swanson 1964</a>, <a href="#swa03">1966</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Answering these questions was understood to require studying and observing 
  the daily activities of scholars (<a href="#hal01">Halbert and Ackoff 1959</a>; 
  <a href="#bat01">Bates 1971</a>), and not only their use of information systems 
  and services. </p>
<p>For instance, the series of studies undertaken by the American Psychological 
  Association (22 reports published between between 1963 and 1968) on scientific 
  information exchange in psychology report on topics such as: the pace of migration 
  of research results from oral discussions and conference reports to final publications, 
  information use habits in the preparation for teaching, scholars' filing and 
  note-taking systems, the role of conferences in the scholarly communication 
  process, problems intrinsic to review-writing, patterns of collaboration, authors' 
  experiences in submitting papers for publication (<a href="#bat01">Bates 1971</a>). 
  The overall approach of this work is nicely summarized in the end of Garvey's 
  book <em>Communication: The Essence of Science</em> (<a href="#gar01">1979</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We have sought to portray scientific communication as a social system in 
    which interactive communication among scientists is its most salient feature. 
    (<a href="#gar02">Garvey and Gottfredson 1979</a>: 320)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They go on to emphasize that innovations or interventions into systems of scholarly 
  communication (journal publishing, libraries, conferences, technologies) should 
  themselves be done in interaction with scholarly communities. The book ends 
  by saying that any reform to the communicative systems of science must consider 
  the active scientific researcher not only as a consumer but also in his role 
  as &quot;producer-disseminator&quot; of information (<a href="#gar02">Garvey 
  and Gottfredson 1979</a>: 320).</p>
<p>The conceptualization of &quot;users&quot; in the dual role of producer and 
  consumer of information yields a broad and active role to the user. Garvey and 
  Gottfredson (<a href="#gar02">1979</a>: 320) not only assumed that users should 
  be placed at the center of systems designed and planned by someone else, they 
  stressed that innovations and interventions in communication systems must ultimately 
  be designed in collaboration with, or within, scholarly communities themselves 
  or they will not become efficient and effective.</p>
<h2>Conceptualizations of information seekers</h2>
<p>Not all early user studies assumed that information system use is always beneficial, 
  rather, Parker and Paisley (<a href="#par01">1966</a>) note that</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Accumulating data have not been kind to normative assumptions of ways in 
    which scientists <em>ought</em> to use information. We have been forced to 
    broaden our investigations to include informal (chiefly interpersonal) systems, 
    &quot;accidental&quot; acquisition of useful information, &quot;inefficient&quot; 
    and &quot;irrational&quot; information-seeking and so on. (<a href="#par01">Parker 
    and Paisley</a>: 1061; emphasis original)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Dervin and Nilan (<a href="#der06">1986</a>: 13-14), in traditional 
  studies &quot;states of being informed or benefited have been assumed to ensure 
  directly from document delivery with no intervening user behaviour.&quot; We 
  may contrast this with what Menzel (<a href="#men02">1960</a>) has to say about 
  the accomplishments of the scientific information system:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>One must, however, remember the very common experience that the information 
    sought is not found; that the information, once gained, finds use in quite 
    unanticipated ways; that information is obtained which was not deliberately 
    sought when one picked up a journal or entered a meeting room; and, finally, 
    that scientific information is obtained on occasions which were not entered 
    for the purpose of information-gathering at all. In the view of the frequency 
    of such occurrences it does not seem satisfactory to restrict one's view of 
    the accomplishments of the scientific information system and its elements 
    to what the information-receiving scientist was aware of before he engaged 
    in the activity concerned. (<a href="#men02">Menzel 1960</a>: 27)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, Menzel (<a href="#men02">1960</a>) preferred to talk about information-receiving 
  acts rather than information-seeking behaviour. Although he used the term &quot;information-gathering 
  behaviour and experiences&quot; he seemed to prefer the term &quot;communication-receiving 
  activity.&quot; This is explained by the fact that Menzel's (<a href="#men01">1959</a>) 
  own and studies he reviewed had already shown that much information of great 
  importance comes through the scholars' informal information network or &quot;accidentally.&quot; 
  He stressed that &quot;what appears as an accident from the point of view of 
  the individual may be an expected occurrence from a larger point of view&quot; 
  (<a href="#men02">Menzel 1960</a>: 50-51).</p>
<p>Parker and Paisley (<a href="#par01">1966</a>) especially praised the interview 
  study by Herner (<a href="#her01">1954</a>) in which &quot;formal and informal 
  communication systems of science&quot; were explored jointly. Swanson (<a href="#swa03">1966</a>) 
  stressed that the planning of future information services ought to be based 
  on the notion of the importance of small clusters of scientists who read and 
  cite each others' papers and who communicate informally. He suggested that</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The mechanized library (...) is in a particularly good position to keep systematic 
    historical records of the associations between users (at least who grant permission 
    to do so) and works requested. This information could be used to discover 
    groups of people with similar literature interests, or perhaps to discover 
    books which share a high incidence of similar use and which grouping therefore 
    ought to be reflected in the catalog. (<a href="#swa02">Swanson 1964:</a> 
    120)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Swanson (<a href="#swa02">1964</a>: 120-121) suggested techniques for discovery 
  of highly correlated clusters of books, correlated because sharing users, or, 
  clusters of users whose correlation is determined by a high incidence of common 
  book use. These suggestions predate automatic recommender systems such as those 
  used by Amazon.com, and social classification and bookmarking systems. Based 
  on results reached in empirical user studies, they still come across as valuable 
  and up-to-date (<a href="#twi01">Twidale and Nichols 1998:</a> 262).</p>
<h2>Conceptualizations of sources</h2>
<p>According to Dervin and Nilan, the traditional paradigm categorized and analysed 
  users and uses according to systems features and variables. On the relationship 
  between studies of scholarly communication to libraries and research institutes, 
  Menzel (<a href="#men02">1960</a>: 5) wrote that</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>To be sure, many studies are carried out within one or a few establishments, 
    but are designed to serve broader interests; and even those that are carried 
    out primarily for guiding local policy can be of more far-reaching significance 
    and interest. This is, however, least likely when the local studies are limited 
    to descriptive statements, as opposed to examinations of functional inter-relationships 
    between the communication behaviour and experiences of scientists and other 
    factors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One such local library study that has more far-reaching significance is Metz's 
  (<a href="#met01">1983</a>) <em>The Landscape of Literatures: Use of Subject 
  Collections in a University Library</em>. It is true that Metz's study is library-centred 
  and document-centred in that it focuses on library collections and observable 
  dimensions of their use. Metz's simple question &quot;who uses what?&quot; continues 
  to be valuable and interesting, however, and his overall approach effective.</p>
<p>Metz (<a href="#met01">1983</a>) used statistical techniques to trace the landscape 
  of interdisciplinary relationships. He focused on what literatures scholars 
  in each discipline actually use, and how interdisciplinary or &quot;ethnocentric&quot; 
  (endogenous, focused on own discipline) their reading is. He found that, for 
  instance, mathematics and geography are dissimilar in showing, respectively, 
  a very high and a very low degree of dependence on endogenous literature. Social 
  scientists relied on widely scattered literature compared to the relative independence 
  of the physical and life sciences. Overall, his library circulation data showed 
  greater dependence on external literatures than citation studies.</p>
<p>Metz (<a href="#met01">1983</a>) also reached interesting conclusions and hypotheses 
  regarding differences in personal libraries/collections reading in comparison 
  to academic library readings, differences in degrees of interdisciplinarity 
  in monograph reading and journal reading, and differences in overall reading 
  practices in comparison what eventually gets cited in publications. He also 
  showed that specialists and nonspecialists approach subject literatures differently.</p>
<p>To be sure, the focus on domains and their subject literatures differs from 
  a people-centred or users-in-problematic-situations approach. We would argue 
  that this is, nevertheless, a fundamentally context-sensitive approach. It treats 
  readers and literatures as inseparable entities. That is, when asking what is 
  the range of literatures used in various specialties by specialists in knowledge 
  production, it places documents and subject literatures at the center of attention 
  without losing sight of essential contextual differences in &quot;how work is 
  conducted with and through texts&quot; (<a href="#dav01">Davenport and Cronin 
  1998</a>).</p>
<h2>Conceptualizations of information needs</h2>
<p>Dervin and Nilan (<a href="#der06">1986</a>) called for more studies on the 
  everyday information needs of average citizens. Dervin and Nilan argued that 
  earlier studies had been conducted within system confines, stuck on habitual 
  behaviours, and had not attempted to deal systematically &quot;with the chaos 
  of individuality&quot; <a href="#der06">(ibid.</a>: 21). There exists some early 
  everyday life information needs studies that appear to be generally very little 
  known, although they are important precursors of everyday life information seeking 
  studies.</p>
<p>The term &quot;life information&quot; was coined by Bates in 1974. According 
  to Bates' succinct definition, </p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>By &quot;life information&quot; is meant information needed for successful 
    living. The area of need ranges all the way from sheer survival (stay away 
    from dogs that walk funny and foam from the mouth) to the most advanced forms 
    of self-realization (where can I study ceramics or transcendental meditation?). 
    The scope of information falling under this rubric is greater than may at 
    first appear. It includes vast amounts of information about how to do many 
    different things in one's culture that will be acceptable and lead to one's 
    survival and emotional satisfaction. (<a href="#bat04">Bates 1974:</a> 53)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book involving Bates' (<a href="#bat04">1974</a>) presentation of the life 
  information research area, <em>Library and Information Service Needs of the 
  Nation</em>, contained chapters on the special information needs of, for instance, 
  the following groups:</p>
<ul>
  <li>labor,</li>
  <li>agriculture,</li>
  <li>creative and performing artists,</li>
  <li>women, homemakers and parents,</li>
  <li>young children,</li>
  <li>young adults and students,</li>
  <li>older people,</li>
  <li>the geographically remote,</li>
  <li> the economically and socially deprived,</li>
  <li>the institutionalized person,</li>
  <li>the mentally and physically handicapped,</li>
  <li> the Mexican-American community. (<a href="#bat03">Cuadra and Bates 1974</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Bates (<a href="#bat02">1973</a>) <em>Review of Literature Relating to the 
  Identification of User Groups and Their Needs</em> additionally discussed a 
  range of literature explicity or implicitly revealing specific needs of, for 
  instance:</p>
<ul>
  <li>continuing education and open university students,</li>
  <li> foreign language speaking people,</li>
  <li>American Indians,</li>
  <li>African-Americans,</li>
  <li>women, and</li>
  <li>the functionally illiterate. </li>
</ul>
<p>The chapters in <em>Library and Information Service Needs of the Nation</em>, 
  and some of the studies reviewed by Bates (<a href="#bat02">1973</a>), discussed 
  the special needs of various interest groups, and what could be done in terms 
  of outreach activities, community information provision and library materials 
  provision to meet those needs. Bates (<a href="#bat02">1973</a>) discussed cultural 
  differences and cultural heritage issues needing more active involvement from 
  the part of the library. The emphasis in these works was firmly on &quot;life 
  information&quot; and &quot;public information provision&quot; through public 
  libraries. A study by Bates (<a href="#bat03">1974</a>) identified information 
  needed by women through analysing information requests (questions) made at a 
  Women's Center.</p>
<p>The book chapters in <em>Library and Information Service Needs of the Nation</em> 
  (<a href="#bat04">1974</a>) outlined the information needs of specific groups 
  according to a common typology: </p>
<ul>
  <li>types of information needed in crisis situations (typical problem situations, 
    e.g., medical, legal, financial),</li>
  <li>types of information needed typically by the group (e.g, health, parenting, 
    homemaking),</li>
  <li>types of information needed by the group for self-enrichment, development, 
    recreation, and leisure.</li>
</ul>
<p>In involving leisure interests, this typology is broader in scope than the 
  focus on problematic situations advocated Dervin and Nilan (<a href="#nil06">1986</a>), 
  among others. The typology may be viewed as an attempt to deal effectively with 
  the seeming chaos of individual needs. The typology incorporated both habitual 
  needs and specific needs of various groups. In terms of habitual needs, McNeal's 
  (<a href="#mcn01">1951</a>) study on reading interests of rural citizens appears 
  interesting. Respondents wanted more materials on the broad areas of home management, 
  health and health problems, hobbies, child care, gardening, sewing and dressmaking, 
  poultry, food processing, and home furnishing (<a href="#bat02">Bates 1973:</a> 
  53). Life information needs hence appear to remain fairly stable.</p>
<p>It could be argued that early library use and user studies were not all oblivious 
  to the user's needs or to sociological contexts. Berelson's (<a href="#ber01">1949</a>) 
  work was on what public libraries can do develop their services, yet he did 
  not necessarily assume that those not using the library would not have had other 
  information sources and channels at their disposal. In the 1930s, Waples (<a href="#wap01">1931</a>) 
  launched a huge study to determine what people read in their lives. This is 
  a fairly user-sensitive question. </p>
<h2>Conceptualizations of methodology</h2>
<p>Dervin and Nilan (<a href="#der06">1986</a>) emphasized qualitative methods 
  as better suited for investigating people as purposive, self-controlling, sense-making 
  beings. In the 1960s and 1970s, survey questionnaires were often perceived as 
  the most effective method for following issues such as migration of results 
  and ideas from informal to formal domains. Menzel (<a href="#men02">1960</a>) 
  discussed techniques of data gathering employed in the reviewed use studies, 
  among them diaries, interviews, and observation. He stressed, however, that 
  in-depth analysis that does not stay at the level of descriptive statements 
  depends of the conceptualizations that the researcher chooses to work with, 
  rather than data-gathering techniques:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>It is sometimes erroneously believed that the choice of data-gathering technique 
    is the principal or even the only important issue of research methodology. 
    (...) Generally speaking, there is no one-to-one relationship between data-gathering 
    technique and the conceptualization of units of sampling and observation, 
    although certain bounds to the latter are set by the choice of data-gathering 
    technique. (<a href="#men02">Menzel 1960:</a> 5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paisley (<a href="#pai01">1968:</a> 21-22) continued the discussion on how 
  to reach beyond pure description by underlining that statistical methods permit 
  inferences to larger populations but &quot;a small purposive sample generates 
  maximum <em>insight</em> rather than inference, per unit cost.&quot; He stressed 
  the need for good middle range theories that can be formed through &quot;successive 
  approximations,&quot; that is, through forming testable hypotheses out of observations. 
  Menzel (<a href="#men02">1960:</a> 16) stated that researchers are in fact rarely 
  interested in amounts of reading or frequencies information-receiving acts for 
  their own sake: &quot;such data only become useful when they enter into comparisons 
  and into the examination of relationships.&quot;</p>
<p>Parker and Paisley (<a href="#par01">1966</a>) noted that the reason why no 
  coherent pattern of scientific information use emerged from earlier findings 
  should not be attributed to methodological failures but the complexity of the 
  problem itself (multiple interacting variables). In Menzel's (<a href="#men02">1960</a>) 
  work, however, we find sketched a research programmefor the study of scholarly 
  communication practices with hypotheses that with some additional work could 
  easily have reached the theory status.</p>
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>This paper has pursued the line of study opened by Bates (<a href="#b%20at05">2004</a>) 
  and Dalrymple (<a href="#dal01">2001</a>) who both questioned the narrative 
  of the user-centred turn. In revisiting the history of user-centred research 
  we have discovered a rich body of findings which are still of great value. Many 
  studies conducted in the 1950s and 1960s pursued research topics and tracks 
  that remain interesting and meriting further study, such as the role of conferences 
  as communication forums, how authors choose the journals where they submit their 
  work for publication, and the role of being familiar with scientists and literatures 
  from other fields to innovation and performance. Much of this work has been 
  somewhat forgotten and under-utilized, therefore, user-centred research may 
  perhaps not have been as cumulative as it could otherwise have been.</p>
<p>In the studies by, for instance, Garvey, Menzel, Parker and Paisley, Swanson, 
  and Allen and Gerstberger, the focus was placed on scholarly communication conceived 
  very broadly, incorporating not only information seeking and use behaviours but 
  also information receiving and sharing, reading, writing and publishing activities: 
  the full arc of communication and information practices. These practices were 
  studied quite user-sensitively in their natural context despite the fact that 
  early user studies usually did have an implicit or explicit aim to support the 
  flow of information through the design of information systems or products.</p>
<p>Today the information behaviour community tends to identify itself through the 
  system-centredness versus user-centredness dichotomy. In other words, there 
  is a tendency to define research foci through a contrast between people-centred 
  questions and system-oriented questions. An example of a people-oriented question 
  is, for example &quot;How do the elderly learn about and cope with problems 
  or opportunities that come up in their daily lives?&quot; (<a href="#cas01">Case 
  2002:</a> 7). An example of a system-oriented question is, in turn, &quot;How 
  does the public use a library for personal pleasure and growth; what they ask 
  for, borrow, and read?&quot; (<a href="#cas01">Case 2002:</a> 7). As a consequence, 
  site-specific, system-specific, or service-specific studies have not been incorporated 
  in the <em>ARIST</em> reviews of the information behaviour research area since 
  the 1990s (<a href="#cas02">Case 2006</a>). In this sense, the Dervin and Nilan 
  1986 article has worked as the most important identity-marker for the information 
  behaviour research community (<a href="#ols01">Olsson 2007</a>).</p>
<p>How we choose to draw the boundaries of a research field and what we choose 
  to count in and out to a large extent depends what we see as the central issues 
  to study. As noted by Case (<a href="#cas01">2002</a>), the boundaries, concepts, 
  methods and research foci of information needs and uses research have, since 
  the earliest reviews (<a href="#men03">Menzel 1966</a>), arosen as much dissatisfaction 
  and dissenting voices than knit together a community of like-minded scholars. 
  Case (<a href="#cas01">2002:</a> 285) described information behaviour research 
  as a field carrying a heavy legacy of fault-finding and a long history of complaint 
  over low quality and general uselessness. One of the strongest concerns voiced 
  over years has been that the user versus system dichotomy is potentially harmful 
  for research programs in LIS (<a href="#per01">Pettigrew <em>et al.</em> 2001:</a> 
  64; <a href="#jar01">J&auml;rvelin and Ingwersen 2005</a>). This may indeed 
  be a distinction that isolates interacting and inseparable actants - people, 
  technologies, literatures, and documents - into separate domains of research.</p>
<p>In revisiting the distinction between system-centred and user-centred research 
  in an attempt to understand continuity and changes in user studies, what struck 
  us as surprising was the broad scope of interests tackled already in 1960s. 
  The joint exploration of both oral and written communication and both reading 
  and writing literature in the early studies may be argued to be even more extensive 
  in scope than the focus on users' information needs advocated by Dervin and 
  Nilan. Another aspect that seems important to consider is that it is quite possible 
  to study information needs sociologically and in a user-sensitive manner also 
  in the context of library-oriented, site-specific, and service-oriented research. 
  Questions such as &quot;who uses what,&quot; &quot;what people read in their 
  lives,&quot; and &quot;what are the criteria for choosing literature&quot; will 
  remain relevant and worthy of study for times to come.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Dervin and Nilan did not incorporate in their review pre1978 user studies. 
  In grounding their call to arms on other critical pieces, their article was 
  a forceful synthesis of the voices of change. Their criticisms focused on conceptualizations 
  of information and users, not on studies of scholarly communication conducted 
  between 1950s and 1970s. These would have mandated different conclusions. Reading 
  the Dervin and Nilan article side by side with the studies on scientific information 
  and communication practices reviewed above, it becomes apparent that Dervin 
  and Nilan were not deeply familiar with this literature.</p>
<p>Like Belkin, Brookes and Wilson, Dervin and Nilan wanted to strengthen the 
  theoretical foundations of information studies in general, and in that respect 
  their article is unquestionably a milestone. It did not mark the beginning of 
  user-centred research, however.</p>
<p>The powerful influence of the Dervin and Nilan article can be at least partly 
  explained by how it captured and synthesized other observed problems in information 
  research: the limited scope of library circulation studies, and shortcomings 
  of studies that sought to present technical solutions to the problems of document 
  retrieval without attacking the underlying philosophical issues about the nature 
  of human knowing, language, and document relevance assessments.</p>
<p>One thing that also may explain the influence of Dervin and Nilan's article 
  is that &quot;systems-centredness&quot; is easily associated with cold technology, 
  indifference toward individual human beings and their problems. &quot;User-centredness&quot; 
  easily appears as ethically sound, warm and compassionate, based on the ethics 
  of caring about people and their problems. There are many traps in these images, 
  however, the most important one perhaps being that there are many different 
  streams of user-centred approaches. The time has come to probe deeper into 
  the differences between diverse user-centred traditions. In this quest, we 
  might as well start from the beginning of user-centred research.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
An enduring goal in information science has been to construct systems
that represent information in an objective, unbiased manner. This
objectivity would enable the system creator to find, in the manner of
scientific discovery, the correct way to represent and organize
information, thus enabling the development of comprehensive, universal
systems. Ranganathan, for example, believed strongly that a universal
helpful sequence of documents was attainable and desirable. In
Ranganathan&rsquo;s view, the specific subject of a book is
inherent within it, waiting to be uncovered through careful application
of logical, rational &ldquo;canons&rdquo; and
&ldquo;principles.&rdquo; For example, Ranganathan speaks of
&ldquo;the true connotation of the term
&lsquo;Medicine&rsquo;&rdquo; as something that will be
apparent to a skilled analyst (<a href="#ran59">Ranganathan 1959</a>). Elaine Svenonius
connects Ranganathan to general system theory and notes this
theory&rsquo;s &ldquo;belief in unity, in the sense that there
are general principles or laws common to all systems&rdquo;
(<a href="#sve92">Svenonius 1992</a>). The implication of such an approach, according to
Svenonius, is that all subject disciplines exhibit commonalities and
that all organizational schemes are to some degree compatible. </p><p>

More recent scholarship, however, has repeatedly shown the presence of
unacknowledged biases in information systems (such as <a href="#ber71">Berman 1971</a>;
<a href="#ols91">Olson 1991</a>; <a href="#bow99">Bowker and Star 1999</a>). Olson, for example, notes how a
separate subject heading in LCSH for &ldquo;male
contraception,&rdquo; in the absence of a corresponding heading for
&ldquo;female contraception,&rdquo; reflects a social
assumption that birth control is primarily a woman&rsquo;s
responsibility (<a href="#ols91">Olson 1991</a>). The presence of bias calls into question
the belief in common general principles and universal system design. </p><p>

The domain analytic approach, as described by Hj&oslash;rland and Albrechtsen
(<a href="#hjo95">1995</a>), can be seen as one response to such problems. In defining the
domain analytic approach, Hj&oslash;rland and Albrechtsen claim that
&ldquo;the best way to understand information in IS is to study the
knowledge-domains as thought or discourse communities&rdquo;
(<a href="#hjo95">Hj&oslash;rland and Albrechtsen 1995</a>). Devising a universal system for all
documents is misguided; instead, we need to analyse and interpret how
different groups define and describe their information. The implication
is that there are multiple, equally valid helpful sequences, and these
sequences depend on domain. In addition, a domain analysis should
uncover all the perspectives at work in a domain, showing how they
relate, how they might work at cross-purposes, and so on, and this
diversity should be represented in information systems. This type of
approach, which systematically reveals competing interpretations of
domain-specific phenomena, would seem to alleviate the problem of
unacknowledged bias. As Mai (<a href="#mai04">2004</a>) notes, classification research has
come to embrace the idea of relativity, moving from a
&ldquo;scientific tradition&rdquo; to a
&ldquo;usage-centric tradition.&rdquo; </p><p>

Through an extended analysis, this paper contends, however, that bias
remains in the domain analytic approach. The root of this bias lies in
the continued sense, in the domain analytic approach, that the
representation of knowledge structures depends on a type of scientific
discovery. It seems that, in Hj&oslash;rland&rsquo;s writings, the domain
analyst&rsquo;s role is to describe a domain, and not to define
one; there &ldquo;is&rdquo; a single domain of, for example,
psychology, and not multiple possibilities for how such a domain might
be constructed. And yet of course a domain analyst has to, at least in
some measure, play an active role in defining a domain for the purpose
of system building: how else to determine the boundaries of the domain,
for example (what to include in the system and what not to include)?
Discussions of domain analysis seem to either skirt such issues,
leaving this problem unresolved, or to rely on subject-matter experts
as the basis for such decisions.&nbsp; </p><p>

This paper argues that neither of these approaches is satisfactory, and
that the apparent inclusiveness of the domain analytic approach may
actually be exclusive. Perhaps paradoxically, I suggest that an
inclusive approach to information system design might involve the
definition and justification of a particular stance toward the
information, as appropriate for the use context of a particular system.
Instead of one domain to be discovered, I submit that there are
multiple domains to be created. If we cannot eliminate bias, then we
should instead attempt to be more responsible about bias and explicitly
decide on and defend the perspectives represented in our information
systems. This type of approach, which draws on the idea of situated
knowledges as expressed by Donna Haraway, is inclusive because the
freedom to define a particular perspective for one situation also
enables the definition of alternative stances for other design
situations. From this perspective, the design of information systems is
both a creative and a critical task.</p><p>

This paper is organized as follows: first, I present the basic tenets
of the domain analytic approach, linking it to the previous work of the
Classification Research Group (CRG) in the UK. Then, I discuss some of
the problems that emerge when considering the how to delineate the
boundaries of a domain, showing how Hj&oslash;rland&rsquo;s reliance on
majority expert opinion to make &ldquo;valid&rdquo; decisions
regarding domain boundaries and contents constitutes a form of bias.
Next, I show how such problems appear in two domain studies. Finally, I
discuss an alternate interpretation of domain analysis for system
design, drawing on the work of Donna Haraway. </p>

<h2>Domain analysis in context</h2>
<p>
The domain analytic approach can be seen as an extension of the work on
special classification schemes performed by the Classification Research
Group (CRG). Members of the CRG recognized that different subject areas
require different approaches to classification. However, they did not
give up one goal of universal systems in the mode of Ranganathan: that
of accurately documenting a true reality in an information system (as
opposed to interpreting that reality in an information system).
Instead, the CRG attempted to isolate smaller, self-contained
&ldquo;realities&rdquo; in particular subject areas. For
example, Langridge (<a href="#lan76">1976</a>) agrees that &ldquo;diverse
characteristics&rdquo; of division are required to serve
&ldquo;different interests&rdquo; in classification. Langridge
explains that a rabbit might be characterized as a physical type, as a
grassland animal, as a pest, and so on. However, Langridge continues,
within the sphere of zoology, rabbits are primarily studied as physical
types, which should, therefore, determine their placement in a zoological
classification, even though habitat (and so the rabbit as grassland
animal) may also be of interest. While the classification of rabbits
may differ according to the discipline under consideration, one should
be able within a single discipline to identify a &ldquo;clearly
predominant&rdquo; characteristic that applies to rabbits; it is
the duty of an information system designer to discover that
characteristic and document it in the classification. </p><p>

The domain analytic approach described by Hj&oslash;rland and Albrechtsen
(<a href="#hjo95">1995</a>) disputes the existence of &ldquo;clearly
predominant&rdquo; characteristics for organizing information. For
Hj&oslash;rland, a subject discipline includes a variety of sometimes
conflicting approaches to the subject matter. In Hj&oslash;rland&rsquo;s
(<a href="#hjo98">1998</a>) study of the domain of psychology, he describes a domain as
constituted by the relationships between phenomena under investigation
and epistemological perspectives that shape the research. A domain, for
Hj&oslash;rland, seems to be the union of the approaches used to study it, and
so includes various sets of concepts for a single phenomenon, as
defined by the included approaches. Psychology, for example, includes
both &ldquo;personality&rdquo; as defined by behaviorism and
&ldquo;personality&rdquo; as defined by psychoanalysis
(<a href="#hjo98">Hj&oslash;rland 1998</a>). Tuominen, Talja, and Savolainen (<a href="#tuo03">2003</a>) show a similar
approach in their ideas for multiperspective digital libraries, in
which the example topic of chiropractic is arranged into documents that
support chiropractic as a medical specialty, documents that debunk
chiropractic, and alternate approaches to solving the same goals.</p><p>

However, the central assumption of knowledge structures as something to
be discovered or excavated persists in the domain analytic view as it
did in the CRG&rsquo;s work. Hj&oslash;rland (<a href="#hjo98">1998)</a> states for example
that &ldquo;a psychological classification should represent all the
most important approaches and subdisciplines in psychology.&rdquo;
While the inclusion of &ldquo;all the most important&rdquo;
approaches makes for a more complicated structure than that described
by Langridge, the underlying idea of an information system as a form of
documentation, as opposed to interpretation, appears quite similar. In
Hj&oslash;rland&rsquo;s view, it seems that a domain, for example of
psychology, exists; it is the system designer&rsquo;s job to find
and describe it, not to create it. Hj&oslash;rland and Hartel (<a href="#hjo03">2003</a>) express
this idea quite strongly as they refute a claim by Tennis (<a href="#ten03">2003</a>) that a
transferable definition of domain is necessary. Such a definition,
according to Hj&oslash;rland and Hartel, would require dependence on a
particular paradigm (it would be biased), and by implication would also
be incomplete. Instead, the definition of a domain should arise from
&ldquo;high-level interpretive study of a subject or community of
interest.&rdquo; An &ldquo;ideal definition&rdquo; is then
&ldquo;negotiated.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Bias and the boundary problem</h2>
<p>
A problem with the concept of an &ldquo;ideal definition&rdquo;
involves the determination by which a particular area is considered
inside the context of a domain. For whom is the definition ideal, and
by what criteria is this decision to be made? Tennis (<a href="#ten03">2003</a>) illustrates
this difficulty by discussing a fringe area of psychology,
transpersonal psychology, in relation to Hj&oslash;rland&rsquo;s
psychology case study. Where does transpersonal psychology fit into
Hj&oslash;rland&rsquo;s analysis? How do we know whether transpersonal
psychology is inside or outside the domain? Hj&oslash;rland, based on his
discussion of stability of knowledge claims and the role of cognitive
authorities, would likely appeal to the role of experts for such a
decision (<a href="#hjo04">Hj&oslash;rland 2004</a>). Yet Hj&oslash;rland also discusses the importance of
considering &ldquo;the different views of the field,&rdquo; and
not just the dominant view, by attempting &ldquo;the fusing of
horizons&rdquo; (<a href="#hjo03">Hj&oslash;rland and Hartel 2003</a>).</p><p>

The language of horizons invokes the historical hermeneutics of
Gadamer (<a href="#gad89">1989</a>), and the way that Hj&oslash;rland operationalizes his pragmatic
realism, as it applies to knowledge organization, uses arguments
similar to Gadamer&rsquo;s hermeneutics. While Hj&oslash;rland emphasizes
the incorporation of multiple, competing viewpoints in the 2003
article, emphasizing non-dominant views, in other work he emphasizes
that in a domain, one approach is not as good as another. In the
psychology case study he claims that &ldquo;reality puts limits to
which approaches can survive in the long run and is a determining part
in the development of knowledge&rdquo; (<a href="#hjo98">Hj&oslash;rland 1998</a>). The domain
analyst evaluates the stability of competing knowledge claims, which
implies an upholding of the status quo. The deference to
&ldquo;reality&rdquo; is developed further in the following: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is still, however, the question of epistemology to
determine if one
kind of construction is as good as another. . . In most cases, experts
are simply in a better position to produce valid knowledge. There may
be exceptions, e.g., connected to ideological bias, but such exceptions
cannot in my opinion make the general rule invalid (<a href="#hjo04">Hj&oslash;rland 2004</a>).
  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>

This identification of experts being closer to &ldquo;truth&rdquo; than laypeople seems also to imply that, even in cases of debate among experts, the dominant or majority view is typically the one that &ldquo;follows the general rule&rdquo; and thus is more &ldquo;valid.&rdquo; By this reasoning one might, for example, exclude transpersonal psychology from the psychology domain, a position likely to be contested by those outside the established boundaries, in this case, advocates of transpersonal psychology. To what authority should transpersonal psychologists then turn when they are designing their own information system? While reliance on majority expert opinion may be a fine strategy for the use contexts of some (or even most) information systems, it is still clearly a form of bias (it is itself reliance on a &ldquo;particular paradigm&rdquo;) and should be acknowledged as such. It is precisely the privileging of majority opinion that Olson (<a href="#ols91">1991</a>) finds problematic. Using her example again that a subject heading choice implies that women are responsible for birth control, perhaps that is how society has heretofore seen this issue; and yet what if that opinion is seen as ethically wrong by a particular system designer for a specific situation? Somehow, the possibility of alternate criteria for decision making should also be recognized. </p>
<p>

The privileging of majority expert opinion is also a key element in
Gadamer&rsquo;s work, although Gadamer is not a realist in the way
that Hj&oslash;rland defines himself. While Hj&oslash;rland refers to the fusion of
horizons as a means to being inclusive and incorporating different
viewpoints, the literary critic Terry Eagleton discusses how
Gadamer&rsquo;s fusion relies on an ability to connect our own
perspectives and the alternate ideas being considered to a common
tradition. The tradition serves the same function for Gadamer as expert
opinion, in its likely closer alignment with reality, does for
Hj&oslash;rland. Eagleton calls Gadamer&rsquo;s theory &ldquo;a
grossly complacent view of history&rdquo; that &ldquo;holds
only on the enormous assumption that there is indeed a single
&lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; tradition [and] that all valid works
participate in it. . .&rdquo; (<a href="#eag83">Eagleton 1983</a>). In
Eagleton&rsquo;s view, Gadamer&rsquo;s sense of history is
merely &ldquo;a club of the like-minded&rdquo; that
&ldquo;cannot tolerate the idea of a failure of communication which
is not merely ephemeral. . .which is somehow systematic: which is, so
to speak, built into the communication structures of whole
societies&rdquo; (<a href="#eag83">Eagleton 1983</a>). Eagleton connects
Gadamer&rsquo;s views with ideology, the ability of a dominant
group to frame discourse so completely that it does not appear as if
there is anything outside the established ways of speaking. Outsiders,
such as transpersonal psychologists (Eagleton would refer more to
women, people of color, the working class, and so on), are not
accommodated because the fact of their existence is not acknowledged.
Hj&oslash;rland, based on the previous quotation from the 2004 article,
implies that majority expert opinion based on ideological bias is the
exception, rather than the rule. Eagleton would disagree, stating that
&ldquo;discourse is always caught up in a power which may be by no
means benign&rdquo; (<a href="#eag83">Eagleton 1983</a>). </p><p>

Hj&oslash;rland&rsquo;s basic conception of domains, with its historical
emphasis and competing approaches and epistemologies, may be vulnerable
to criticism similar to that of Eagleton&rsquo;s on Gadamer. While
Hj&oslash;rland speaks of multiple paradigms within a domain, he
doesn&rsquo;t describe multiple domains. A sense of convergence is
implied; there is but one &ldquo;psychology&rdquo; with
different strains within it. There is also one best way to approach
domain analysis: through examination of underlying epistemologies. This
appeal to a common underlying structure of domains is reminiscent of
Svenonius&rsquo;s description of general system theory and the
universalist position adopted by Ranganathan. The paradigm of
scientific discovery still appears to exist in Hj&oslash;rland&rsquo;s
conception of domain analysis, with experts as privileged interpreters
of reality. A domain has a universal structure, built on expert
opinion, that an analyst merely needs to find and document. An approach
of this sort this doesn&rsquo;t seem to fully enable the promise of
relativity &ldquo;as an advantage and a strength&rdquo; as
discussed by Mai (<a href="#mai04">2004</a>). </p><p>

To be clear, none of this discussion implies that a domain of
psychology as described by Hj&oslash;rland (<a href="#hjo98">1998</a>) is not valid. It may be
valid for a particular purpose, and the majority opinions of experts
may be the most reliable in many situations. But other domains of
psychology, and other criteria for decision making, may be equally
valid for other purposes. While majority opinion might appear to be a
benign or often useful form of bias, it seems unwise, given
Eagleton&rsquo;s critique of Gadamer, to assume that such an
approach will always work appropriately. If bias is unavoidable,
however, can information systems be designed to incorporate bias in a
responsible manner? One possibility to address such problems is to make
explicit the criteria used to construct each domain, and to explore the
various means by which such criteria might be selected. </p>

<h2>Analysis of two domain studies</h2>
<p>
The exclusionary tendency (a form of bias) in the concept of a single
domain (no matter the variety within it) is exhibited in
Abrahamsen&rsquo;s domain analysis of musical genres (<a href="#abr03">Abrahamsen
2003</a>). Abrahamsen discusses two &ldquo;subdomains&rdquo; of
music, classical music and popular music, which tend to be analysed
according to different paradigms. These subdomains, as defined by
Western musicology, exclude quite a lot of music, such as most
non-Western music. (The music produced by the indigenous Australian
instrument called the didgeridoo, for example, is neither
&ldquo;classical&rdquo; nor &ldquo;popular&rdquo; nor
even &ldquo;composed&rdquo; in way that many people in the West
think of music.) So what exactly is Abrahamsen describing? Is it
&ldquo;the&rdquo; domain of music, just described in an
incomplete manner? This appears to be Hj&oslash;rland&rsquo;s view, and
also Abrahamsen&rsquo;s. Abrahamsen emphasizes the importance of a
single domain of music because he believes this is an inclusive stance.
He claims that &ldquo;the organization of musical knowledge should
regard the whole field of music and not just certain sub-fields or
paradigms inside the field. Depending on the goal of the organization,
many possible perspectives on music, as well as many kinds of music,
may turn out to be valuable. . .&rdquo; (<a href="#abr03">Abrahamsen 2003</a>). In his
analysis, however, Abrahamsen does, as noted, pick certain subfields to
cover. While Abrahamsen may wish to be inclusive, he also chose the
subdomains to include in his own analysis deliberately (of course,
practically, he has to limit the scope of his inquiry, and yet, that
seems to make it imperative that such decisions be acknowledged and
justified). </p><p>

Abrahamsen alludes to perspectives being valuable depending on goals,
and a more thorough acknowledgement of this seems important. Although
Abrahamsen wants his domain discussion to apply to
&ldquo;music&rdquo; as a whole, his analysis does have a
specific, pragmatic goal: better indexing of popular music in libraries
(presumably in Danish libraries, or at least libraries with a
collection of popular music and popular music listeners similar to
those in Denmark). Abrahamsen believes that the current paradigms of
musicology that he describes do not handle indexing of musical genres
well for popular music. He claims that aspects from both paradigms can
be combined for better music indexing (again, the unspoken assumption
is popular music of types listened to by Danes or at least by
Europeans, which may not be the same as popular music listened to by
rural populations in China). This goal does not require absolute
placement of various paradigms within a single domain of music; it just
requires a set of multiple paradigms. Abrahamsen&rsquo;s pragmatic
goal might shape a domain more effectively than
&ldquo;music&rdquo; does, and might actually be less exclusive,
in its specificity, than an &ldquo;inclusive&rdquo; but
necessarily unspecific and incomplete domain of
&ldquo;all&rdquo; music, particularly one that relies heavily
on the opinion of an expert majority. Abrahamsen&rsquo;s reasoning
for why music indexing would be improved based on the paradigms that he
considered would constitute a rationale for why those paradigms should
be included in his domain of music (specifically music to be indexed in
Danish libraries). Limiting a domain does not provide license to merely
go with the dominant view, as Hj&oslash;rland suggests; in fact, one can use
the imposed limits to define a standpoint by which one can critically
examine information and defend a particular domain construction. Such a
critical engagement would seem to go farther in considering multiple
viewpoints than an appeal to experts. </p><p>

A single-domain approach also presents problems in terms of
multidisciplinarity. For example, in Orom&rsquo;s discussion of the
&ldquo;domain of visual arts, with special emphasis on
painting,&rdquo; (<a href="#oro03">Orom 2003</a>) various paradigms of art are analysed.
In each paradigm, the extent of the domain appears different. In the
&ldquo;materialistic&rdquo; paradigm, or social history of art,
art styles are related to &ldquo;the dominant class,&rdquo; and
this paradigm finds expression in a Soviet classification, in which
Marxist theory is paramount. If a single domain for art is presumed,
does this mean that Marx is part of &ldquo;the&rdquo; art
domain, albeit according to a particular paradigm? It&rsquo;s
difficult to see, given this situation, how any domain
wouldn&rsquo;t end up including almost any subject that one could
name, in some form or another. A similar problem was identified by D.J.
Foskett, regarding special classifications:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Special classification schemes] are attempting to assemble
in one
context, as it were by brute force, all the contexts in which a
particular entity may exist. It is evident that, in practice, any
subject may be taught as part of the curriculum of an educational
institution. Are we therefore to make an attempt to put every
conceivable subject term in our curriculum facet? (<a href="#fos74">Foskett, 1974</a>)
  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>

Foskett&rsquo;s answer to this dilemma was to advocate for a
general classification scheme, or at least an
&ldquo;ur-classification&rdquo; that specified common concepts
and their relationships (<a href="#fos74">Foskett 1974</a>, <a href="#fos91">1991</a>). This ur-classification,
as a type of universal language, would enable consistent translation
between different special schemes. With an ur-classification to provide
underlying structure, an art classification could link to Marxist
concepts in other areas of the general scheme; these concepts could
then be expanded as necessary in the art context. Hj&oslash;rland&rsquo;s
emphasis on history and epistemology may also be seen as an effort to
identify an ur-classification through which both multiple domains and
multiple paradigms within a single domain might be constructed and
compared similarly. Another analogy might be the philosopher Charles
Taylor&rsquo;s &ldquo;language of perspicuous
contrast&rdquo; in which one could compare cultures according to
&ldquo;some human constants,&rdquo; so that cultural
differences could be seen as &ldquo;variations&rdquo; on a
standard theme (<a href="#tay85">Taylor 1985</a>).</p><p>

The approach of the ur-classification or language of perspicuous
contrast relies on the identification of common concepts that are
consistently related and are universally applicable. If concepts need
to be redefined entirely from one context to another, or if they just
don&rsquo;t apply at all in different contexts, then there is no
way to perform the translation (the concepts are incommensurable). If,
for example, Marxist art criticism did not just add to the art domain
but instead completely reconfigured the idea of criticism, then
integration would not be possible. Such difficulties appear
significant. Taylor was not able to describe his language of
perspicuous contrast concretely, and Foskett was not able to define an
ur-classification, either in its concepts or in its relationships.
Hj&oslash;rland, in addition, finds it difficult to describe how an emphasis
on history and epistemology as principles of difference applies to all
domains, and not just scientific and scholarly ones. </p><p>

However, an approach to domain analysis that acknowledges the existence
of multiple (perhaps overlapping and contradictory) domains in a single
subject area can ameliorate the problem of multidisciplinarity, because
it enables the restriction of fundamental categories and the
establishment of clearer bounds upon the domain. We can define a domain
of art that includes Marxist criticism and one that does not; these
domains will not be fully compatible, but they may be partially so. If
a domain is not to be universally inclusive, however, then by what
criteria are we to set its limits? </p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>Some limiting criteria might involve system users, the tasks
they need to perform, and the environment in which the tasks are
undertaken. Nielsen, for example, who describes her
thesaurus-construction research at a pharmaceutical company as a domain
study, is concerned with work contexts and tasks from the perspective
of several different actors (such as people performing basic research,
people performing clinical tests, and people involved in marketing and
sales) (<a href="#nie01">Nielsen 2001</a>).
Her study attempts to integrate data about
the corporate information environment, individual information seekers,
and the subject field. However, the data collection methods
used&mdash;focus groups, search query analysis, and word
association tests&mdash;only enable a sense of the subject area
itself, which we might call the knowledge domain, from the limited
perspective of company employees, without defining that perspective in
constrast to the larger knowledge domain. Similarly, Albrechtsen and
Pejtersen,
who describe the use of cognitive work analysis to inform
classification design for a national film archive, focus their data
collection activities from within a specific work context (<a href="#alb03">Albrechtsen
and Pejtersen 2003</a>). Hj&oslash;rland (<a href="#hjo02">2002</a>) criticized Nielsen&rsquo;s work as too specific; in his view, a
&ldquo;work domain&rdquo; is not the same as the knowledge
domains that he describes; one should study a knowledge area, such as
pharmacology, and not a single pharmaceutical company. Hj&oslash;rland notes
that &ldquo;A domain analysis in its first stage should consider
not just one company, but a field developing and sharing common
concepts, terms, and knowledge&rdquo; (<a href="#hjo02">Hj&oslash;rland 2002</a>).<br />
</p>
<p>
While Nielsen suggests that a domain can be located in a specific
work environment, and while Hj&oslash;rland&rsquo;s work counters that a
knowledge domain must be based upon the broader context of a subject
field, I suggest that a middle way can be found. The variety of
criteria such as those used by&nbsp; Nielsen in her study can be seen,
I think, as a means to interpret and provide order to the larger
knowledge domain. The difference between her approach and what I
propose is that the more general knowledge area described by Hj&oslash;rland
should be acknowledged as well. In Nielsen&rsquo;s study, a
variety of information collected from participants in a particular work
environment makes up a domain; the general knowledge area (in this
case, of pharmacology) is only described via the data collected from
employees in the environment under study. In my view, the work
environment information becomes a lens through which the general
knowledge area is considered and a more focused domain explicitly
carved out, in contrast to the general subject context. In other words,
the knowledge domain in general should be conceptualized through the
criteria gleaned from the study of the work environment. The
perspective that a particular company might have is hard to understand
unless it can be seen against the broader subject landscape, and it
seems important to define what characterizes the particular
company&rsquo;s view. </p><p>

In contrast to Hj&oslash;rland, however, I am not sure that a single, general
knowledge domain can be truly defined. Instead of a pharmaceutical
company&rsquo;s appropriating a useful slice of a general domain of
pharmacology, and adding to this its own internal concepts and
coinages, as Hj&oslash;rland implies should be done, I suggest that the
company needs to explicitly construct its own domain of pharmacology.
Constructing a system to organize information to some extent requires
&ldquo;taking a stand&rdquo; on how to interpret a knowledge
domain; it is both a creative and a critical task. The information
system is a medium through which a position on the domain is
articulated. Such determinations can only be clearly made in specific
situations. For the pharmaceutical company example, government
regulations are a key element of pharmacology, while the bounds of a
purely scholarly domain of pharmacology might not extend to regulations
intended for production and sale. To make sense of a domain constructed
through these various considerations, the criteria by which information
is evaluated, included, excluded, and maintained needs to be part of
the domain analysis. The resulting information system will perhaps be
&ldquo;biased,&rdquo; in this case toward the mission, values,
and so forth of a particular company; but it will be an acknowledged,
more responsible bias, with the factors that contribute to the
system&rsquo;s unique perspective clearly identified. </p><p>

The determination and expression of criteria for constructing a domain,
including a process for defining and selecting and a way of justifying
what is selected, seems important in designing an information system,
if one takes the approach of multiple, specific domains, as opposed to
broad, universal ones. Use, after all, is only one category of
criteria, and there are many levels of use and users, and many
different rules and justifications to be built out of this perhaps
overgeneral concept. A domain that is sufficiently articulated through
both the criteria and process that led to its definition as well as by
analysis of its contents may be characterized as a type of situated
knowledge, as described by the feminist historian of science Donna
Haraway (<a href="#har88">Haraway 1988</a>). Haraway postulates situated knowledges as an
alternative to both traditional scientific objectivity and to strong
social constructionism. For Haraway, the key to assimilating both
&ldquo;a no-nonsense commitment to faithful accounts of a
&lsquo;real&rsquo; world&rdquo; and &ldquo;an account
of radical historical contingency for all knowledge claims and knowing
subjects&rdquo; is &ldquo;a critical practice&rdquo;
(<a href="#har88">Haraway 1988).</a> Hj&oslash;rland, in his conception of domain analysis, seems
to want to incorporate both these ideas as well, to be skeptical of
knowledge claims and also to be a &ldquo;realist.&rdquo; But
where Hj&oslash;rland relies, apparently, on experts and a tacit sense of
commonalities to structure and define domains, Haraway advocates
&ldquo;critical theories... to build meanings.&rdquo; These
meanings are by necessity particular and specific; they also need to be
continually justified. As Haraway elaborates, &ldquo;positioning
implies responsibility for our enabling practices&rdquo;; in the
context of domain analysis, Haraway&rsquo;s comment provides an
explanation for why the explication and justification of the criteria
used to construct a domain is necessary. The domain analyst is not
merely describing and analysing, but creating, participating in
&ldquo;struggles for and contests over what may count as rational
knowledge&rdquo; (<a href="#har88">Haraway 1988</a>). Significantly, Haraway believes
that this position of well-defined engagement enables the possibility
of partial translation between different situated knowledges. This
helps to answer an objection that a multiple-domain approach is too
fragmented and relativistic. The extent to which a domain is
articulated and justified helps to enable its linkage, comparison, or
evaluation with other domains. </p><p>

Haraway&rsquo;s ideas suggest that library and information science might benefit from an
increasing focus on design, with a corresponding de-emphasis on
discovery in the mode of science. Creators of information systems are
not merely documenting a universally perceived reality or even the
reality of a particular use context. They are actively participating in
that context through the design of systems that not only support work,
but have the potential to change work. A key aspect of of design, in
this conception, becomes the acknowledgement of decisions and
decision-making processes. Current manuals and standards documents for
classifications do not provide much guidance in this area. The 2005
ANSO-NISO standards for controlled vocabularies, for example, describe
rules for the grammatical form and spelling of thesaurus terms in some
detail, but summarize construction methods in a few sentences. One of
three approaches involves experts drawing up a list of terms, without
any recognition of the negotiation undoubtedly required to produce and
order such a list. Soergel&rsquo;s classic manual for thesaurus
construction, while full of detailed instructions in many technical
areas, such as semantic factoring, is not as helpful in providing
criteria to aid conceptual tasks, for example to determine whether a
candidate descriptor should be included in a thesaurus (<a href="#soe74">Soergel 1974</a>).
Soergel advises the thesaurus designer to determine if the candidate
descriptor will be useful but doesn&rsquo;t explain how to make or
justify such a determination. Future research in library and information science might attempt to
characterize different positions from which a system designer might
define the domain of an information system, as well as different
criteria that might be used in multiple situations and methods that
might reveal criteria and their application to a particular context.<br />

</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

I have argued that Hj&oslash;rland&rsquo;s description of domain analysis
seems to imply the concept of a single domain per subject area,
structured by a common set of principles (specifically epistemological
underpinnings), with a reliance on expert opinion to evaluate the
stability of the approaches are seen as undergirding each domain. This
single-domain approach thus appears to rely on assumptions that may not
hold true in all situations and that constitute a form of
unacknowledged bias. A single domain necessitates ill-defined domain
boundaries (which presents additional problems due to
multidisciplinarity) and is inevitably incomplete, while lacking the
requirement to explicitly justify what the domain includes and how it
is structured. In contrast, recognition of multiple domains for a
single subject area requires that an information system designer
describe and defend the criteria by which a domain is constructed. In
its specificity, a multiple-domain approach also enables clarification
of how different points of view overlap in the domain, easing the
multidisciplinarity problem and enabling the possibility of partial
translation between similar domains. The multiple-domain approach
emphasizes a critical stance on the part of the system
designer&nbsp; in defining, selecting, using, and justifying the
criteria used to create and structure a domain.&nbsp; <br />

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>is constantly changing and evolving. Businesses themselves change over time and as they grow and develop, the information needs of the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>will change. At the same time the information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>needed to support <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and development will also need to change (<a href="#vak04">Vakola and Wilson 2004</a>). It is <span>essential</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> therefore, to review those information needs so as to continue to align <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>operations with changing market needs, particularly in a <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>where even small companies face the impacts of globalisation with overseas competition, using world wide supply <span>chains</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> expanding their own markets internationally and engaging in e-business (<a href="#win06">Winch and Bianchi 2006</a>; <a href="#tay04">Taylor and Murphy 2004</a>; <a href="#sim04">Simpson and Docherty 2004</a>). The critical success factor (CSF) method can be useful in assessing changing information and strategic needs to meet market demands (<a href="#fri95">Friesen and Johnson 1995</a>).</p>

<h3>Critical success factors</h3>

<p>The classic paper by Daniel (<a href="#dan61">1961</a>) proposed that, in times of change and <span>growth</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> companies need to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>on their critical information needs relating to corporate <em>success factors</em> to fully achieve control and management effectiveness. Rockart (<a href="#roc79">1979</a>: 85) developed the concept, popularising the <em>critical success factor</em> method, which identifies 'for any <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>number of areas in which results, if they are satisfactory, will ensure successful competitive <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for the organization'. They are areas that should receive <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and careful <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by managers in order to monitor <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and improve existing areas of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#roc79">Rockart 1979</a>). </p>

<p>Bullen and Rockart (<a href="#bul81">1981</a>) identify three <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>uses for the method: (1) to determine an individual manager's information needs; (2) to aid an organization in its strategic planning process; and (3) to aid an organization in its information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>planning process.  However, Friesen and Johnson (<a href="#fri95">1995</a>) illustrate how the tool can be used as a 'versatile management tool' and be applied to <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>a wide <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of planning, <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and operational problems across a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of industries.</p>

<p>Five <span>prime</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>sources of critical success factors have been proposed by Bullen and Rockart (<a href="#bul81">1981</a>): the industry; competitive strategy and positioning; the environment; temporal factors; and managerial position. Further to this, they suggested that factors can be classified by these five aspects, or by internal versus external, or <em>monitoring</em> versus <em>building</em>. <em>Monitoring</em> involves the scrutiny of existing situations such as <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>management, whilst <em>building</em> factors are those that are needed to plan or change for the <span>future</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> e.g., the factor, 'Establish and communicate a clear strategy for corporate development' could be classified as <em>competitive strategy and positioning</em>, <em>internal</em>, and <em>building</em>.</p>

<h3>Critical success factors and small and medium-sized enterprises.</h3>

<p>The critical success factor method has been widely applied in large organizations (<a href="#sar89">Saraph <em>et al.</em> 1989</a>; <a href="#ahi96">Ahire <em>et al</em>. 1996</a>; <a href="#bla96">Black and Porter 1996</a>). The method can have equally useful <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>within small or medium-sized businesses in securing and maintaining competitive advantage (<a href="#dic84">Dickinson and Ferguson 1984</a>; <a href="#yus99">Yusof and Aspinwall 1999</a>) and can help in decision making, developing management information <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> strategic planning and focusing organizational development (<a href="#dic84">Dickinson and Ferguson 1984</a>). </p>

<p>Yusof and Aspinwall (<a href="#yus99">1999</a>) proposed ten success factors specifically for small and medium-sized businesses engaged in implementing total <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>management; these were <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>from reviewing past literature. They later surveyed companies to confirm their results and <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>four <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>areas that <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>a critical core for those companies:

<ol>
<li>management leadership;</li>
<li>measuring results, progress and performance;</li>
<li>appropriate training for employees; and</li>
<li>adopting a <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>assurance system (<a href="#yus00">Yusof and Aspinwall 2000</a>).</li>
</ol> 

<p>Similarly, Achanga <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ach06">2006</a>) identified four <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>success factors for <em>lean implementation, </em>within small and medium-size companies.  Lean implementation is the implementation of lean manufacturing, which is a productivity initiative aimed at streamlining operations, improving efficiencies, competitiveness, and reducing costs, resulting in increased customer value (<a href="#wom91">Womack, <em>et al</em>. 1991</a>). Achanga's 'lean implementation' success factors are:</p>

<ol>
<li>leadership and management strategy;</li>
<li>finance;</li>
<li>organizational culture; and</li>
<li>skills and expertise. (<a href="#ach06">Achanga 2006: ??</a>) </li>
</ol>

<p>These factors were mirrored byWong and Aspinwall ( <a href="#won05">2005</a>) who <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>small and <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>companies adopting knowledge management. They proposed a set of eleven factors from their <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of twenty-six companies; their top ranking factors were:</p>

<ol>
<li>management leadership and support;</li>
<li>culture; </li>
<li>strategy and purpose; and</li>
<li>resources. (<a href="#won05">Wong and Aspinwall 2005: ??)</li>
</ol>

<p>Feindt <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#fei01">2001</a>) and Jeffcote <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#jef02">2002</a>) identified sets of factors for small companies with fast <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>who were adopting e-commerce, which focused heavily on aspects of information content and information technology. Much earlier, Dickinson and Ferguson (<a href="#dic84">1984</a>) identified the necessity of information, particularly management information <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> for survival, even within small companies, but acknowledged that investment in such <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>could not be afforded by small businesses. </p>

<p>Information management was determined to be a 'very' critical factor in Tibar's (<a href="#tib02">2002</a>) Estonian industry study, <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for gathering both internal and external information and for the dissemination and management of information within the company and dissemination to stakeholders. The critical nature of information management and information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to sustaining competitive advantage and achieving change is discussed in the literature (<a href="#kar94">Karababas and Cather 1994</a>; <a href="#huo01">Huotari and Wilson 2001</a>; <a href="#gui00">Guimaraes 2000</a>). This view is shared by Marchand (<a href="#mar00">2000</a>: 8) who states that 'Effective use of information is critical to how executives manage their companies and create value in their markets'. Information needs vary from manager to manager and change over time (<a href="#roc79">Rockart 1979</a>). </p>

<p>This paper con0ers a case of two small companies at a time of <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and change, where, as a result of critical success factor analysis, corporate information competence emerged as a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>factor supporting organizational development and diversification into new markets.</p>

<p>The project developed from a need to re-engineer <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>processes to sustain <span>growth</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> The companies' <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>fitted with 'leadership crisis' described in Greiner's (<a href="#gre72">1972</a>) classic corporate <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>model, where initial creativity leads to problems as a company grows. Growing companies find themselves in situations that can no longer be managed through informal communication and they need increased financial control, so the founders of the company are burdened with unwanted management responsibilities, for which they often <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the skills and knowledge critical for corporate development.</p>

<p>To achieve the <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>necessary for the two companies in this case study, a <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/5RqclUyZa">Knowledge Transfer Partnership</a> was set up between the businesses and the School of Business Information at Liverpool John Moores University in the northwest of the UK.. The companies' Directors recognised a skills gap with which they felt the University could help, as the aim of <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>Transfer Partnerships is to strengthen competitiveness in UK companies by the stimulation of innovation through collaborative partnerships with a university, college or research organization. The projects can be for between one and three years, with the aim of helping the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>make change in an area that is high priority. The Partnership supports the project (from a <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of government and company funding) and places an associate within the company to manage the project. </p>

<p>With any <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>Transfer Partnership a <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>work plan is submitted for the duration of the project, in this case twenty-seven months. The project plan included a number of analytical <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to provide a rich picture of the current <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> e.g., process <span>mapping</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> information technology and information audit and critical success factor analysis to analyse the current <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> outline a number of strategic options and <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and implement the appropriate information support <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to allow for corporate <span>growth</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>The companies</h3>

<p>Company <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>(suppliers of a complete <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of religious artefacts) and <span>Company</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>B (suppliers of early years literacy and educational resources) sell high <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>teaching resources to <span>schools</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> nurseries and colleges. Both companies specialize in many innovative, exclusive designs, particularly in early years resources. <span>Company</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>B has a registered trademark and the company works hard at protecting and exploiting its brand. Both companies also do a small amount of publishing and in-service training on the use of their products. The market is predominantly UK-based currently, although both companies have plans to expand globally.</p>

<p>The two companies are operationally linked, sharing staff, plant and processes, but each is a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>limited company with its own accounts. In addition, <span>Company</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>B has a <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>Director who is not connected with <span>Company</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>A.</p>

<p>Company <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>has shown stable and steady <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>over the past fifteen years. The <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>Company</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>B <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>over the last few years has compounded the need for a more integrated, streamlined and efficient operation to enable further <span>growth</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>Transfer Partnership, therefore, was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to enable the companies to improve operational efficiency and provide enhanced managerial control and information <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> The Directors would then have both the information and the time to engage in effective strategic planning. The Partnership was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to provide the company with the necessary analytical, process modelling, information and information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>management and change management skills to successfully redesign and re-engineer their <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to ensure its continuing <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and to develop new <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>opportunities.</p>

<p>The <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of this project was internal (and operational) rather than external. This was a conscious decision on behalf of the Directors to meet the specific needs of their companies and the confines of what was achievable in the time frame of the project. The Directors wanted to get the internal processes right before focussing on external issues. The external factors were planned for a <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>project with a strategic marketing <span>focus</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> allowing the companies to expand and develop in a targeted way within the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> with the knowledge that their internal structures could support that <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>development.</p>

<p>What emerged from the initial familiarisation with the corporate <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>was a realisation that the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>information was more serious than first realised. The <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>within the companies was what <a href="#dan61">Daniel (1961</a>) describes as a common problem, a 'management information crisis', where the relevant data are not available for decision making or <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>measurement, creating a management information problem which can hamper or paralyse <span>business</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> Such problems <span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>from a gap between the 'static information system' and the changing organizational structure at a time of change and <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#dan61">Daniel 1961</a>). The need to examine the critical aspects of the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>had become of <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>importance as the information was not available to make decisions to enable the project to proceed as planned. </p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>The method used for this analysis was adapted from that used by Caralli, which is based on Rockhart's (<a href="#roc79">1979</a>) classic research and which is robust and <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for use in small businesses: the method has five phases: </p>

<ol>
 <li>Defining the scope.</li>
 <li>Collecting data.</li>
 <li>Analysing data.</li>
 <li>Deriving CSFs.</li>
 <li>Analysing CSFs. (<a href="#car04">Caralli 2004: ??</a>)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Defining the scope. </h3>

<p>The decision was made to identify organizational success factors to aid decision making and strategic <span>direction</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> Caralli (<a href="#car04">2004</a>: 47) recommends that '..the scope of the exercise must traverse the entire organization so the <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of each executive-level manager is included and con0ered'. Interviews, therefore, took place with Directors, departmental managers and team supervisors.  Interviewing, significant analysis and discussion with the manager are required to successfully determine critical factors (<a href="#car04">Caralli 2004</a>). </p>

<h3>Collecting the data. </h3>

<p>The data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>involved two methods: reviewing critical <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>within the organization and conducting interviews with key staff.</p>

<h4>The document review:</h4>

<p>A document review is effective in gaining an understanding of the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>or <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the organization and its departments.  Many organizations document their mission,  vision, <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and strategic objectives and make these known to  stakeholders.  This documentation  reflects what is important or <em>critical </em>to  managers with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to the organization (<a href="#car04">Caralli 2004</a>).</p>

<p>The document review included: mission <span>statements</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>objectives  and the staff appraisal  document.</p>

<h4>The interviews</h4>

<p>Eight interviews were carried out with the companies' Directors,  departmental managers and team supervisors, ensuring <span>representation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>from each  operational unit. The interview schedule (based on <a href="#roc79">Rockart 1979</a>) was amended (rewording  Question 4, adding Questions 8 and 9) to add value in terms of personal success factors aligned to <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>goals (<a href="#car04">Caralli 2004</a>).  The rewording of Question 4 was minor, changing the original from 'darkened room' to 'desert island'; the essence of  the question remained the same, 'What would you most want to know about the  organization... three months later?' The managers had not been <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>with the  concept of critical success factors before the exercise.</p>

<p>The interview schedule included the following questions:</p>

<ol start="1" type="1">
 <li>What are the critical success factors in your job right now?</li>
 <li>In what one or two areas would <span>failure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to perform well hurt you most?</li>
 <li>In what area would you hate to see something go wrong?</li>
 <li>Assume you are on a desert island with no access to the <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>world, what would you most want to know about the organization when you were rescued three months later?</li>
 <li>What is you personal mission and role in the organization?</li>
 <li>What are your most critical goals and objectives?</li>
 <li>What are your three greatest <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>problems or obstacles?</li>
 <li>What measures are implemented to determine if your goals and objectives are being met?</li>
 <li>What do you hope to achieve with the organization over the next two years?</li>
</ol>

<p>There was no particular order to the interviews, which,  to some extent, was determined by availability.  However, the interviews took place within one working <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to avoid discussion or collaboration between colleagues that might have affected the content. The interview team were the Partnership associate and an academic supervisor who had been working with the company on the Partnership. The interview schedule was structured, but the team were prepared to ask follow-up questions, or clarifying questions where deemed necessary. The interviewees were asked to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the differences, if any, between the two companies in their answers.</p>

<p>The participants were encouraged to understand their role in contributing to the process and its importance in the development of the organization. Huotari and Wilson (<a href="#huo01">2001</a>) <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the value of critical success factors in relating the information needs of personnel to organizational objectives. This view is <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by Yusuf (<a href="#yus95">1995</a>), who sees individual factors, such as key skills and good character, needing to be aligned with environmental factors, such as government and political demands. The participants were reassured that their data would be confidential; this was of <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to all participants, as some sensitive issues emerged. As a result of the interviews, the Project Manager and <span>principal</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>interviewer were in <span>possession</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of facts regarding workplace tensions that may not otherwise have come to light so readily. Establishing trust between the investigators and interviewees allowed for deep and honest responses, which contributed to richness of the data and success of the study.  The interviews lasted approximately thirty to forty minutes. All interviews were taped with permission of the participant.</p>

<p>Having two interviewers helped with the discussion of what should be an acceptable course of <span>action</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> Decisions were made to strip out emotional content and concentrate on factual data for analysis. Tensions and sensitive or personal issues that came to the fore were not acted on as a result of the interviews, it being deemed inappropriate for reasons of confidentiality and professional integrity. However, having being made aware of some tensions before the exercise, the Project Manager had already put in place, just before the interviews took place, staff forums and other communication initiatives to encourage more open communication among staff, giving the opportunity for these issues to re-emerge appropriately within the workplace, at which point it would be legitimate to act on them. </p>

<h3>Organization of data. </h3>

<p>The data were cleaned by removing identities, irrelevant comments and emotive <span>statements</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> This left factual data and <span>valid</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>descriptive of the corporate <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>which could be <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>into a series of 'activity <span>statements</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>: </p>

<p>The interviews and document analysis generated a total of 479 activity <span>statements</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> Ninety-seven <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>came from the documentation, leaving 372 <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>generated by the interviews. Of the total <span>statements</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> seventy-four were specific to <span>Company</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>A and 113 were specific to <span>Company</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>B, giving 292 <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>con0ered relevant to both companies. At times during the interviews managers had <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in separating  the two companies in their responses, as they were so <span>intrinsically</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>linked, particularly in certain functions such as operations. At this stage it was useful to have investigators with in-depth knowledge of the companies to clarify responses. The activity <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>were managed within spreadsheets.</p>

<h3>Data analysis. </h3>

<p>The activity <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>were developed and placed into affinity groupings (similar or related statements). Affinity groupings enable the categorisation of data that share common <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>or <span>qualities</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>so that a common <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>can be developed on which to base further analysis. It might be necessary to clarify the original statement, so it is often wise to note the <span>origin</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of each statement. The process used was as follows:</p>

<ol start="1" type="1">
 <li>To note the <span>origin</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of each activity statement, con0ering the core content, what was <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by the interviewee, what was meant by the statement.</li>
 <li>Clarify any ambiguity, without detracting from the immediacy and essence of the original statement.</li>
 <li>With each individual statement, make <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>between it and similar data con0ering the essence of each statement in terms of content and meaning, placing each statement into an affinity group. It is helpful here to have more than one <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for discussion. Any <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that cannot <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>be placed in a grouping, should be left to one 0e. It may be appropriate to create new group.</li>
 <li>Check the <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to ensure they are placed with data with which there is an affinity. Also look for any emerging sub-groups. Duplicates confirm the importance of an issue and help confirm the affinity groupings, but can be <span>eliminated</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for ease of data management.</li>
 <li>Those <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that do not fit into a group must be re-examined. Decisions must then be made to see if    they do fit into a group, or if a new group is required. If an individual statement has value it may warrant a success factor of its own.</li>
</ol>

<p>The data analysis was carried out by the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>investigator, the associate, who had immersed himself in the companies for the previous six months, developing an in-depth knowledge of the businesses, their structures, staff, <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> product and markets. Themes emerged from the affinity groupings: nine <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>themes emerged, with supporting themes in all groupings.</p>

<p>The supporting themes <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the activity <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in as few a number as possible and are used as a guide to deriving the factors.  Group discussion can be helpful in developing the supporting themes, which communicate the key messages, which can be restated concisely as a success factor, e.g., 'Achieving market success through effective strategic sales and marketing'. Caralli (<a href="#car04">2004</a>) stresses the importance of aiming for the smallest number of factors that accurately and completely characterise the organization. The aim in developing the supporting themes is to clarify the <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>intentions or concepts that the activity <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>(See Table 1.).</p>

<p>At this stage, the data have been reduced to a small number of supporting themes which are easier to manage than large numbers of activity <span>statements</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> Establishing the themes from the activity <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>is an iterative process, going back and reviewing making sure the meaning and essence of the data is apparent in the themes.</p>

<p>The supporting themes highlight the <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>content or intent of a CSF; they provide a <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>or definition of a CSF, as shown in Table 1. </p>

<h4>Derive critical success factors. </h4>

<p>Critical success factors were derived in relation to the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>supporting themes and the <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>developed and are <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>from the data through the process outlined in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>1:</p>

 <p><strong>Figure 1: The critical success factor process</strong></p>
 </div>

<p>The supporting themes are used as a guide for deriving the factors, which are refined versions of the supporting themes. They are concise so as to be useable in a management context, have impact and clarity.  They are usually <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to a few words for ease of communication, though for some management <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>a lengthier explanation can help to expand the meaning.</p>
<h4>Analysis of the critical success factors. </h4>

<p>In the analysis of the success factors we looked at relationships between factors and <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>functions, examining emerging themes and key issues to incorporate into the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>management team meeting was set up to <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and disseminate the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the analysis.  Here the team was able to <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the issues that had emerged, <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and refine the final wording of the factors and <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>how they should be taken forward and influence the strategic planning process and impact on operational objectives. The factors clearly defined key areas in which the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>had to ensure excellence, giving a basis for corporate <span>action</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> Information and communication <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to be issues at all levels of the organization and <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>all functions. This having been clarified in the analysis, the process could then be taken forward both operationally and strategically.</p>

<p>This stage of the analysis also served as a check that the factors had been genuinely raised by the interviewees (the management team) and not engineered by the interviewers. It meant that the team had involvement in the final outcome; it helped with communication and dissemination of the results and <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the discussion of key issues.</p>

<h2>Findings</h2>

<p>Nine <span>identical</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>factors emerged for both companies and a number of supporting themes emerged for each factor. The supporting themes highlighted differences between the companies, reflected by their different markets, the customer base and the differing nature of the products. These factors also led to some differences in operational requirements. Table 2 sets out the supporting themes and related organizational success factors, showing where differences exist. The differences <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>different products and markets and the resulting operational activities.</p>

<h3>Information as a critical success factor</h3>

<p>Systems support for information management was identified as being on the whole inadequate. The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>system was based on the accounts requirements and developed piecemeal over time. As staff had changed and needs changed, the system had not developed with the company.  The potential might exist within the system, through add-on modules and staff training, to provide a system that supports all <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>functions more fully and in a more integrated way than is currently allowed. An alternative would be to purchase a new system. Specific problems arose with inaccurate data input, gaps in the data, inadequate coding and <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of data and inability of the system to produce <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>readable reports with the right information.</p>

<h4>Product supply</h4>

<p>Examples of activity statements:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Ensure that staff have good product knowledge.</li>
<li style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Have the information to price products appropriately</li>
</ul>
  
<p>In general, all staff had good knowledge of the products and this was seen as important, particularly for <span>Company</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>A, dealing with a wide <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of religious artefacts and needing to advise and support customers. What was lacking was a clear pricing structure for products and complete and <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>data on best selling products. This <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of management data hindered a planned approach to product development and formal product portfolio analysis. </p>

<h4>Market success</h4>

<p>Examples of activity statements:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Produce catalogues that are exciting, fun, informative and colourful giving the company its cutting edge.</li>
<li style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Have excellent market research and knowledge of the educational markets.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no formal strategic market intelligence within the organization.  More <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>factual information is needed relating to the companies' position within their relative markets and the success of their products. Focused market research is not within the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of skills and expertise of staff in-house. Markets cannot be targeted efficiently without this market research, hampering the companies' development. Key managers have knowledge of the industry, the competitive <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> specific markets and gather intelligence on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis; but that knowledge is not always communicated <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the company. Promotion and marketing was also seen as key to providing customers with product information.</p>

<h4>Effective corporate communications</h4>

<p>Examples of activity statements:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Stock information needs communicating to the customer.</li>
<li style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Investigate the potential for using email and e-commerce more effectively.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>Two <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>information aspects emerged as being critical within this theme. First, there was the need for effective communication of information <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the company to encourage inter-departmental understanding. Secondly, there was need for effective communication of information externally, mainly to the customers to ensure good customer service and from the suppliers, with whom communications can be difficult because of their remote locations (especially for <span>Company</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>A).</p>

<p>In addition, the companies' Websites lacked sophistication and information content, being only a basic shop window, lacking any e-commerce functionality. <span>Company</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>B was further developed than <span>Company</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>A, having started to outsource its Web development to external contract.</p>

<h4>Customer relations: </h4>

<p>Examples of activity statements:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Be informative.</li>
<li style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Pass up-to-date information to the customer.</li>
</ul>
 
 <p>Having good customer relations was seen as critical. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>need to develop the information <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>about customers so that customer relationship management within the company could be enhanced to support increased sales and marketing activities was identified. This development relies on a good CRM database. Communicating <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>stock and order information was also seen as important in maintaining good customer relations. This information was not always to hand.</p>

<h4>Company morale</h4>

<p>Examples of activity statements:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Have well trained knowledgeable staff.</li>
<li style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Have the appropriate technical skills and understanding to carry out the job.</li>
 </ul>
 
<p>The critical nature of company morale was <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>reported during the interviews. The working <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>was seen as important, as were a number of human resource management functions such as management <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and relationships, skills training and development, and encouragement and reward. The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>information-critical aspect of this factor lay in having the information to do an effective job in terms of training and development.  Information literacy was a key aspect and was more critical within some <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>functions, e.g., accounts and finance, than others. Being informed in general about corporate <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>was also identified as having an impact on corporate morale.</p>
 
<h4>Efficiency of operations: </h4>

<p>Examples of activity statements:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Have a good system supporting operations.</li>
<li style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">More <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>stock information needed.</li>
 </ul>
 
<p>Stock control data were often inaccurate. This compounded problems of over- or under-stocking and effectiveness in customer supply and delivery. There was some <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>information on operational activity, but not <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>enough to allow for efficient monitoring of operations activities or to allow for improvements to be made. Information on and from suppliers was also important and not always available, given the complex and diverse nature of the companies' supply <span>chains</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> especially <span>Company</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>A, which dealt with a large number of small suppliers worldwide (e.g., rural village co-operatives in less developed countries).</p>

<h4>Financial stability</h4>

<p>Examples of activity statements:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Keep <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>records.</li>
<li style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Use information to measure and monitor finances.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>The existing information system is based on the accounts function, which, consequently, is currently best served in terms of information. However, there emerged some problems with data completeness, <span>accuracy</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> integrity and validity, which illustrated a need for data input <span>discipline</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> Reporting facilities were identified as inefficient, requiring substantial <span>amounts</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of staff time to produce meaningful reports. Efficiencies were needed for effective data output as these reports subsequently required time to be invested in data manipulation, cleansing and analysis. Skills in financial information analysis also needed developing.</p>

<h4>Strategic management</h4>

<p>Examples of activity statements</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;">
<li style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Establish clear key <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>indicators.</li>
<li style="font-size: 14pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Use information to improve organizational planning.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>critical information issue related to this factor was not having the information needed to make strategic decisions based on sound evidence, expensive mistakes sometimes being made in terms of product or market diversification, purchasing decisions, or strategic options. Much of the decision making was based on sound personal knowledge and experience, but without the underpinning of hard factual evidence.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>The nine factors that emerged from this case study were: (1) product supply; (2) market success; (3) effective corporate communications; (4) customer relations; (5) company morale; (6) efficiency in operation; (7) financial stability; (8) strategic management; and (9) corporate information competence. Information was a prevailing theme with <em>corporate information competence</em> emerging as a critical success factor and information a critical supporting theme either explicit or implicit in all other factors. </p>

<p>The critical importance of information in relation to all the case success factors is <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by research from the literature. As early as <a href="#hu095">1995, Huotari</a> identified information management as one of eight critical success factor in two cases (pharmaceutical industry and publishing industry); the other factors being; personnel, marketing, research and development, resources, productivity and <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and finance. In Huotari's study, the cases are described as <em>polar</em> industries, having very different businesses and organizational goals, yet information management was identified as critical to <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in both cases.</p>

<p>Ledwith (<a href="#led06">2006</a>: 437) states that 'the <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of small firms is most likely to <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>through the innovation and development of new product and services'. In her con0eration of a number of small firms, she found that the communication of information required to develop new products could be a problematic organizational factor hampering product development. <em>Product supply</em>, innovation and development are critical to the small firms in this case study. Holland (<a href="#hol00">2000</a>) supports the sharing of information and ideas for effective product development, highlighting as dysfunctional behaviour the withholding of information and information gate-keeping. The literature is supportive of the present study's <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of extremely innovative small businesses, with no formal product portfolio analysis and lacking information to enable them to develop their products on sound financial costings, or target them efficiently. Holland (<a href="#hol00">2000</a>) <span>believes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>is one where businesses have to 'innovate or die'. <span>Critical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to achieving product success, she proposes the development of cross-functional teams who share and use information.</p>

<p>Team working further enhances <em>company morale,</em> which can contribute positively to the <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and development of SMEs and the establishment of a working <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and culture conducive to excellence (<a href="#pas06">Pasanen and Laukkanen 2006</a>; <a href="#wij96">Wijewardena and Cooray 1996</a>; <a href="#yus99">Yusof and Aspinwall 1999</a>). Organizational culture was identified by Achanga <em>et al.</em> (2006) as one of four key critical factors for achieving 'lean implementation' in their study of ten European organizations. Important to this cultural factor were other aspects such as managerial personality and ability and acceptance of change. <!-- These issues were also reflected in activity <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>within this case study supporting a working <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>conducive to a high <em>company morale</em>, though change was felt to be more of a <em>strategic management</em> issue concerning <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>development and the need for strategic information, including clearly communicated succession. --> One of the <span>prime</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for critical success factor analysis is to aid strategic planning especially in times of organizational change (<a href="#dic84">Dickinson 1984</a>). For companies with a small staff and key leadership component, <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>continuity and succession planning are important issues which can seriously affect <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>stability</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#samo5">Sambrook 2005</a>). </p>

<p><em>Effective corporate communication</em> of information was an important factor affecting individual managers in the two companies. Poor communication of information, particularly at times of <span>growth</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> development and change, can have a negative impact on all other critical <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>areas and, <span>ultimately</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> corporate strategy and <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#fri95">Friesen and Johnson 1995</a>; <a href="#hol00">Holland <em>et al</em>. 2000</a>; <a href="#led06">Ledwith <em>et al</em>. 2006</a>).</p>

<p>The communication of information was seen as important <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the supply <span>chain</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to achieve market success. This view is upheld in the literature, with Stone ( <a href="#sto03">2003</a>) and Ngai <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#nga04">2004</a>) con0ering how technology can transform the supplier-customer relationship for businesses. At the customer end of that supply <span>chain</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> the communication of information was seen as important by managers in maintaining and improving customer relations, a relationship that Jones (<a href="#jon00">2000</a>: 31) insists does not '...just happen. It needs to be managed'. Central to management of the customer relationship is the need for customer information; using information to increase customer satisfaction (<a href="#mar01">Marchand 2001</a>).  This need for customer relationship management information was identified in the activity <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>underpinning the <em>Customer relations </em>factor.</p>

<p>Other market intelligence is of equal importance to achieving the factor of <em>market success,</em> as small businesses operate in an increasingly competitive global <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> Even small businesses need to have a systematic approach to the gathering, management and analysis of market intelligence, using competitive, customer and operational information for leverage within the industry (<a href="#mar01">Marchand 2001</a>; <a href="#gui00">Guimaraes 2000</a>). This information is critical to support decision making and ensure that financial and investment decisions are based on sound evidence. Financial pressures can hamper small companies: Achanga <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ach06">2006</a>) found the small businesses in his study to be 'financially inept', lacking financial skills, knowledge and resources. Access to in-depth financial data was a problem in the companies studied here and, in agreement with the study by Achanga <em>et al.</em> ( <a href="#ach06">2006</a>), finance emerged as a critical success factor for small companies. Dickinson and Ferguson (<a href="#dic84">1984</a>) stated that cash was a <span>universal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>success factor for small businesses, an opinion confirmed by this study, where <em>finance</em> emerged as being critical. Yusof and Aspinwall (<a href="#yus99">1999</a>) also identified a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of resources as an ongoing problem faced by small businesses, impacting on negatively on the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>operations.</p>

<p>The <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>operations, efficiency and effectiveness can only be <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>if the operations are correctly monitored and that information is gathered, stored and analysed (<a href="#yus00">Yusof and Aspinwall 2000</a>). This can be seen as a three-stage process: (1) identify success factors; (2) link performances <span>measurements</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to the factors; and (3) measure only those factors that can be <span>controlled</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#tay93">Taylor and Convey 1993</a>; <a href="#mar97">Martin 1997</a>). Information needed for the critical <em>efficiency of operations</em> was not always available in this case study. The process of achieving operational efficiency is information-intensive, but <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to corporate decision making and <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>corporate information competence.</p>

<blockquote>a company or organization having information management skills and <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to support <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy and operations: generating, gathering, analysis, dissemination and use of the appropriate information effectively, ensuring information security, validity and integrity </blockquote>

<p>fits well with Peppard <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#pep00">2000</a>) who propose an 'organization information competence <span>framework</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> based on three broad domains: information strategy competencies, information exploitation competencies and information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and technology supply competencies. Peppard <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#pep00">2000</a>) proposed that information competencies should not be a solely information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>function, but should be distributed <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the whole organization for <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>value creation.  Marchand (<a href="#mar01">2001</a>) goes further and argues that managers should adopt an information orientation to <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy to improve <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>performance</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> achieve <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>leadership and compete with information. He sees information orientation as having three elements: information technology <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> information management <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and information behaviour and <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that link to improved <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>value in terms of market share <span>growth</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> financial <span>performance</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> product and service innovations and superior company reputation.</p>

<p>Earl (<a href="#ear00">2000</a>: 16) argues that 'every <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>is an information <span>business</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> with technology, <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and information itself supporting and determining <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy. Kirk (<a href="#kir99">1999</a>) describes the work of managers in small companies as 'information intensive' and argues that managers of such businesses can utilise information, integrating information and <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy just as successfully as managers in large organizations, when <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by effective information management. From this case study, <span>Company</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>A and <span>Company</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>B show a developing information intensity, they are aware of gaps in their knowledge and skills and recognise the need for more effective utilisation of information and information competencies within their businesses. The analysis has been successful in identifying key areas for strategic <span>focus</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> with information being critical in all aspects of the <span>business</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> supporting developments in more integrated information <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> supporting <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>growth</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>Lessons learned</h3>

<p>The <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in this study were <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>from the point of view of being from just two companies and reflecting the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>specific to those companies. However, this is in keeping with the wider application of the critical success factors approach in con0ering <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>problems as described by Friesen and Johnson (<a href="#fri95">1995</a>). The research method and <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>could still be useful to practitioners to replicate and <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>within other organizations. Equally, researchers can build on this case study and use the method across a <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>number of organizations to <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and assess the reliability of both the methods and <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> With this in mind, each organization is different and likely to be at different stages of development, thereby needing sensitivity to each specific case.  Qualitative research methods such as this allow for this flexibility in interpreting the <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The analysis is intensive and time consuming. In this case, there was a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of strategic documentation and the interviews <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>more useful, giving a closer reflection of reality within the company. To some extent, the <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>reflected <em>how it <span>ought</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to be</em>, rather than <em>how it is</em>. </p>

<p>In this case, the interviewees were open and honest, sharing a number of sensitive issues and feelings. The need for confidentiality is therefore paramount. It also meant that unless carefully managed, the interviewees unburdened themselves, with a tendency to stray from the question.  Interview skills are therefore critical.  It is important for interviewers to immerse themselves in the corporate <span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> so that a full and thorough understanding of the data can be <span>achieved</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> All the managers stated they found the exercise useful in helping them to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>on critical <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>issues.</p>

<p>The data analysis stage can be lengthy. Care must be taken to strip out only irrelevant data in the data cleansing process.  The <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the activity <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for defining the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>themes is important and is an iterative process. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>temptation to reduce the data to a bare minimum, i.e., single word factors, should be resisted as this detracts from the understanding of what is critical.  The supporting themes provide illustration and <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and allow for greater understanding. Establishing the factors can be confounded by overlaps of interest; it is important at this stage of analysis to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the true <em>essence</em> of what was being said. This may <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the researcher to go back to the original data to confirm the context and meaning of the activity statement.</p>

<p>Ranking factors in such small businesses is difficult where individual managers will each have their own agenda to some extent. The ranking is best carried out at the strategic planning stage by the management team.</p>

<p>Further <span>mapping</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the factors to organizational functions can <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>which functions <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>more support and strategic development, enabling critical issues to be fed into the organizational strategy. This should be done with the involvement of the key managers and staff</p>

<p>This method used in this study, which was based on that used by Caralli (<a href="#car04">2004</a>), was manageable within a small <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  In <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations, there would need to be teams of interviewers, who would <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>training to ensure standardisation. The amount of data gathered in a very large organization might be difficult to manage.</p>

<p>The method is subjective and open to bias which <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>skills, <span>discipline</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and integrity on behalf of the interview team to guard against. The interview team need good communications skills, interview skills, <span>powers</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of analysis, professionalism, trustworthiness and to have <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>insight.</p>

<p>The method is time-consuming. The processes and <span>terminology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>can be confusing and take time to absorb and understand. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>commitment is required on behalf of the research team. The analysis stage is also open to bias and because of this is best not carried out by one individual.</p>

<p>However, the data are rich.  If <span>properly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>carried out, they can reveal the real essence of the corporate <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>or specific <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>problem. They give a foundation for corporate decisions to be built on evidence rather than instinct and gut feelings. The data, having been gathered in confidence, are helpful removing the problem of team meetings, where a few individuals are able to dominate the proceedings and push through their agendas, with the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of important issues being kept covered up because individuals do not feel able to <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>out.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The method adopted was <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for the small <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> This case study confirms the value of critical success factors as Bullen and Rockart (<a href="#bul81">1981</a>) proposed: determining the individual managers' information needs, aiding the strategic planning process and aiding the information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>planning process. The initial aim of this study was to help determine strategic direction; however, the results <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>reaped benefits in all three areas (individual, strategic and information system planning), with managers having knowledge of key areas of <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>which, when made explicit through the definition of factors, 'provide a common point of <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for the entire organization' (<a href="#car04">Caralli 2004</a>: 2).</p>

<p>It is <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for small businesses in today's competitive <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to take a strategic approach to their information needs if they wish to develop and remain competitive.  If information expertise is not present within the company, it is advisable to invest in that expertise through recruitment, training, partnership, or outsourcing. This study confirms previous research <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>relating to the critical role of information in organizations and specifically in small and medium-sized enterprises (<a href="#huo95">Huotari 1995</a>; <a href="#mar01">Marchand 2001</a>; <a href="#won05">Wong and Aspinwall 2005</a>; <a href="#ach06">Achanga <em>et al</em>. 2006</a>).</p>

<p>As a result of this study, mangers have been able to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>on how their individual needs align with the organizations' goals. <span>Critical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>areas have been identified for strategic development and information management and <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>planning have been identified as being especially critical to improving <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>performance</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> supporting strategic development and maintaining competitive advantage.</p>

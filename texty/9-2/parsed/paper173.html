<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In 2002, the Business School at University College Worcester (UCW) decided to cancel most of their print journals in order to subscribe to two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>e-journal packages: EBSCO's Business Source Elite service and the ACM Digital Library. Business Source Elite provides full text from over 1,090 journals covering <span>business</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> management, economics, banking, finance and accounting. In addition to the full text, this database <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>indexing and abstracts for over 1,600 journals. The ACM Digital Library provides access to over 102,500 full-text articles from journals, magazines, and conference proceedings as well as many citations and <span>tables</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of contents. The rationale for this change was the belief that learning would be enhanced by the significant increase in titles available and by the easier access, especially for part-time and distance <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Some academic staff also hoped that electronic access would <span>prove</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to be more attractive to <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> many of whom did not make much use of journals.</p>

<p>Academic staff were disappointed when the inspection of assignments suggested that the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of e-journals was not affecting how <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were carrying out research to support their learning. In order to encourage <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to use the new resource and to exploit the benefits of electronic searching, it was 
decided to <span>trial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>a strategy of actively promoting e-journals. </p>

<p>This paper evaluates a project that implemented this strategy, which was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>aim of <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>a hypothesis that learning can be enhanced by promoting the use of e-journals. It was run jointly by a member of the library staff and an academic within the Business School and was funded by the Learning and Teaching Centre at UCW, to run over the academic year 2002-03.</p>

<p>The project was based on the <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that an ability to carry out research is <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to a student's learning, a view that is <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the Higher Education <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> For instance, the U.K.'s <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Assurance Agency Subject Benchmark Statement for General Business and Management states that, <em>&quot;graduates are <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to be able to demonstrate... <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to conduct research into <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and management issues... and for such to inform the overall learning process.&quot;</em> (<a href="#QAA00">Quality Assurance Agency, 2000, section 4.1k</a>). <a href="#sco00">Sconul (2000)</a> <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the ability as <em>&quot;a 'tool' for the 'job' of being a learner&quot;</em>. Doherty. <em>et al.</em> cite a report on U.S. undergraduate <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>which: </p>

<blockquote>..challenges <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to rethink their traditional instructional models, to <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to a model of inquiry-based learning wherein the student is involved in research from the <span>beginning</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>....The skills of analysis, evaluation, and synthesis will become the hallmarks of a good <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> just as absorption of knowledge once was. (<a href="#doh99">Doherty. <em>et al.</em>1999</a>)</blockquote>

<p>Other outcomes of the project were <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to be increased collaboration between library staff, <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>staff and <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> improved learning autonomy and critical use of learning resources in <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and an increased awareness of the potential of library resources by academic staff.</p>

<h2>Literature Review </h2>

<p>A review of literature related to e-journals was undertaken. The vast majority 
  of papers <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>into two categories. The first category of article <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the 
  implications to library services, in terms of policies and <span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> working 
  <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> funding issues, control, cataloguing and access management. These 
  are not relevant in the context of impact on learning. </p>

<p>The second <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the users and their attitude to e-journals, usually within 
  a single institution. Many look from the point of view of academic staff and/or 
  researchers, rather than undergraduates, and there is a general <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that 
  postgraduates and researchers have <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>e-journals more enthusiastically 
  than undergraduates (e.g. <a href="#wol01">Wolf, 2001</a>, <a href="#nel01">Nelson, 
  2001</a>, <a href="#loc01">Lock, <em>et al.</em>, 2001</a>). These studies identify 
  many common factors which affect acceptance or <span>resistance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to e-journals. Advantages 
  are seen to be the convenience of <span>desktop</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> twenty-four-hour access, the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>
  of titles available, remote access, time saving and ease of searching. Barriers 
  to use can be a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of awareness or knowledge of how to access them, technical 
  problems, <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of archives, password requirements and high user expectations. 
</p>

<p>Several <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>initiatives have been undertaken in the area of user behaviour 
  by JISC (the UK's Joint Information Systems Committee of the Higher Education 
  Funding Councils) of which the JUBILEE and JUSTEIS projects give valuable information 
  on student use of electronic resources over several years (<a href="#jub03">3rd 
  Annual Report of the JUBILEE project, 2003</a>). Of those <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>sampled, 
  two-thirds claim to be dependent on Electronic Information Services, for similar 
  reasons given in the earlier studies. As well as the technical <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>
  etc., the time to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and to acquire competence emerge as issues. </p>

<p>The JUBILEE project has also identified that level of take up of services by <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is dependent on factors such as training, awareness and promotion to and by academic staff. The importance of promoting the services, and the need to improve users' information skills also emerged from other papers. Aston 
University is one of the few institutions that reports very positive uptake of e-journals by undergraduates as well as postgraduates and staff (<a href="#mal01">Mallett &amp; <span>Smith</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> 2001</a>). They put this down to pro-active and careful marketing, and training which is embedded into undergraduate programmes of study. <em>&quot;However, the key to student acceptance..is the promotion of the sources to staff who then recommend these sources to the <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot;</em> The need for skills training to be embedded in subject areas to maximize its effectiveness is also asserted by <a href="#rob01">Roberts (2001)</a>, who 
argues that research such as the IMPEL2 project in the <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>1990s makes it clear that, <em>&quot;the promotion or embedding of electronic information services into the learning process must begin with partnership&quot;</em>. </p>

<p>It is notable that none of the papers reviewed attempts to quantify the effect 
  upon learning, beyond <span>measurements</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of uptake, and there is an implicit <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>
  that easier access to a greater <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of resources must have a positive impact 
  upon the student experience. The question must be asked whether the expense 
  and activity being undertaken to introduce and manage e-journals is <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>
  worthwhile in educational terms. </p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>Several <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were taken in order to <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the hypothesis that promoting 
  e-journals enhances learning. An e-journal induction was delivered to forty-eight 
  <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>registered on a Level 2 Information Technology module [that is, a module 
  taught to <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in Years 2 and 3 of an undergraduate programme] and a 'research 
  quotient', calculated from responses to a questionnaire, was developed. This 
  quotient was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to measure a student's ability to carry out appropriate 
  research to support their learning. Prototypes of the e-journal induction and 
  questionnaires were trialled on another group of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and consequently refined. 
</p>

<p>The process then employed was to: </p>

<p>In addition, the bibliographies from the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> module assignments were analysed with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of resources used, and compared with assignment bibliographies submitted by previous cohorts <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the same module. </p>

<p>Finally, <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>groups were used as a means of obtaining <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>data from the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by exploring their experiences and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>towards using journals and e-journals. </p>

<h2>E-journal training - <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and implementation </h2>

<p>UCW undergraduate <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>programmes currently have an undifferentiated Level 
  2, with <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in their second and <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>years of study sharing modules, and 
  with a diverse background in terms of entry routes and study pathways. Embedded 
  library skills instruction is inconsistent, and the undifferentiated Level 2 
  makes it very difficult to track the <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of skills. </p>

<p>It could be assumed that there were almost certainly widely disparate information literacy levels and experience of e-resources amongst the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the module. This <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was backed up by experience of dealing with <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the library (at the Enquiry desk for instance), anecdotal evidence 
and the questionnaires prototyped with an earlier group of <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>Experience suggested that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>would be particularly lacking in the areas of <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>electronic <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>skills and evaluation skills, as well as having a <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>experience of journal literature; what journals were and how they differed from other types of information. Feedback received in the training sessions and <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>groups (see below) confirmed the validity of these assumptions. </p>

<p>The aims of the training session were therefore: </p>

<ul>
<li>To provide <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with an understanding of the usefulness of journals.</li>
<li>To encourage appropriate use of e-journals. </li>
<li>To introduce electronic <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>techniques. </li>
</ul>

<p>The content of the e-journal training session was based upon an analysis of the research requirements of second-year <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> as defined in a paper by <a href="#god02">Godwin (2002)</a>. This identified appropriate benchmarks based upon the SCONUL headline Information Skills (<a href="#sco00">SCONUL, 2000</a>) and are listed below in relation to the Research Quotient. </p>

<p>The session started with an <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the nature of journals, with printed copies being handed out and the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>encouraged to feedback their impressions. This was an interesting experience and it was clear that, as <span>expected</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> many <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were not <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with journals. They successfully recognised the currency and authority of the content; some were daunted by the technical nature of some of the articles, and most were shocked by the price! They were then helped to identify the pieces of information (author, <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>etc.) that could be entered into different fields of a database, a concept with which they were <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as IT <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> It was explained how these could then be used to retrieve an electronic journal article. </p>

<p>The <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were then shown how to access the various e-journal resources available through the library service, using a PowerPoint <span>presentation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>session immediately afterwards allowed the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to gain experience in using the resources, with members of library staff on hand to answer questions and give help. The impression gained was that most <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>tried out the resources, with varying degrees of enthusiasm, but not many of them worked through the exercise sheet provided. This might have been because they felt confident as IT <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to engage with the <span>software</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> It meant however that they missed out on tips and examples specifically <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to help them research the assignments they had just been set, which would have reinforced the learning advantages of e-journals. </p>

<h2>Research Quotient </h2>

<p>In order to <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the hypothesis that learning can be enhanced by promoting the use of e-journals, a Research Quotient (RQ) was developed. This was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to measure a student's ability to carry out appropriate research to support their learning; specifically which resources they used, how they located and selected them, and the electronic <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>techniques they used. </p>

<p>The <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> answers from the questionnaires were compared against appropriate benchmarks from Godwin's paper (<a href="#god02">Godwin, 2002</a>), as indicated in Tables 1- 4, below. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>scoring system was <span>devised</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with weighting <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>any change towards attaining higher level benchmarks. All 
the benchmarks relate to Level 2 unless indicated otherwise.</p>

<h2>Analysis and discussion of outcomes </h2>

<p>The <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>who had received the e-journal induction were asked to complete the questionnaires on two <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>occasions. Firstly, immediately before the delivery of the e-journal induction and then secondly, five weeks later. This second occasion took place after the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>had had the opportunity to apply 
the lessons learnt from the e-journal induction to the completion of an assignment. Although more than forty questionnaires were completed by <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on both occasions, only thirty pairs of these questionnaires could be matched and the <span>remainder</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were discarded (for analysis purposes) - this <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of correspondence was not unexpected as not all <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>attended both <span>lectures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and other <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>intentionally or unintentionally <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to include identification on the completed questionnaires. </p>

<h3>Analysis of Research Quotient scores </h3>

<p>Data from the matched questionnaires were used to <span>calculate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the respective RQ. The result of these calculations was an average RQ of 64.3 out of 144 before the e-journal induction compared with an 
average score of 75.5 out of 144 in respect of the follow-up questionnaires. As yet no comparative benchmark data exist for the RQ. </p>

<p>Significance <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was used to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>whether the matched RQ scores suggested 
  that promoting e-journals had affected how <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were carrying out research 
  to support their learning. It was assumed that the <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>data <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>
  a normal <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and so <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was performed using the standard <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for 
  comparing means, when matched <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are available. The null hypothesis, alternative 
  hypothesis, <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>level and <span>formula</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for the calculated value of <em>t</em> 
  are <span>formally</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>stated below </p>

<div align="center"><img src="p173Fig1.jpg" width="189" height="143" alt="fig1" /></div>

<p>The calculated value of <em>t</em> is 3.82, compared to a <em>t</em> 5% (df=29) value of 1.699. This suggests that we must reject the null hypothesis at the 5% level and accept that promoting e-journals had affected how <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were carrying out research to support their learning. The data are also significant at the 0.1% level.</p>

<p>The increase in the RQ was particularly <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by scores in four of the seventeen questions. The scores for these four questions are con0ered below.</p>

<p>Question 2 was, &quot;Tick the boxes which describe the resources you use when 
  doing research for an assignment&quot;, using the four-point scale, &quot;Always 
  use&mdash;Normally use&mdash;Occasionally use&mdash;Never use&quot; and <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>

<p>The data <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>an encouraging increase in journal usage for assignment research. Students, with one exception, who, before the e-journal induction, never used journals to research assignments, now <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that they use journals occasionally. This is matched by occasional-use <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> who now perceive themselves as normally using journals for assignment research. Inspection of bibliographies indicates that the majority of this enhanced journal usage is of e-journals. The high use of e-journals by these undergraduate <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is markedly different to the behaviour of undergraduate <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>reported in <a href="#wis03">Wise (2003)</a>, where only 5% of undergraduates used e-journals. As no data are available on printed journal use in the Wise <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>it is perhaps sensible not to speculate on the markedly different usage pattern in the UCW project.</p>

<p>The authors <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that increased utilisation of journals by these <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> as a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information, implies a maturing attitude to their learning. It can be argued that this maturity manifests itself in an awareness of the <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the peer review process and of the need to evaluate information 
from a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of sources.</p>

<p>Questions 7, 16 and 17 query &quot;the ability to locate and access information&quot;.</p>

<p>Question 7 was, &quot;Tick the boxes which describe how you locate resources when doing research for an assignment&quot; using the four-point scale, &quot;Always use&mdash;Normally use&mdash;Occasionally use&mdash;Never use&quot; and <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>2 aggregates the answers to this question.</p>

<div align="center"><strong>Figure 2: Database use</strong></div>

<p>The increased use of journals (Question 2) has been <span>accompanied</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by a corresponding increase in electronic database searching for journal location <span>purposes</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> This is, perhaps, not surprising as the two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>e-journal packages that were <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>include their own <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines and do not include a browse facility.</p>

<p>Questions 16 and 17 were subdivisions of the general question, &quot;Tick the boxes which describe the frequency that you use the following <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>techniques to interrogate an electronic database&quot;, using the categories, &quot;Boolean operators (i.e., and/or/not)&quot; and &quot;Phrase/proximity searching&quot;. The same four-point scale as in the previous question was used, and Figures 3 and 4 aggregate the answers to questions 16 and 17.</p>

<p>The data from these questions <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that after the e-induction training, 
  <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are making more use of <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>search techniques. This increased use 
  was confirmed in the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>groups (see below), when <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>also articulated 
  their frustration in carrying out <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>search techniques. The authors <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>
  that <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>search techniques facilitate more efficient retrieval of relevant 
  e-journal articles and it is reassuring to <span>observe</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>their <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and application. 
  Even if we accept that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>assess themselves as being more skilled than 
  they <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are (<a href="#cmo01">Cmor and Lippold, 2001</a>), the results 
  <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>a pleasing relative increase in their skills.</p>

<p>The authors <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that the increase of scores for questionnaire questions 2,7,16 and 17 are attributable to some or all of the following factors: the on-line access of e-journals and <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines, the collaboration between academic and library staff, the timeliness of the e-journal induction and the 
association of the e-journal with an assessment. These are con0ered below.</p>

<p>E-journals had been available for a semester prior to the project and on-line <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines for paper journals were well <span>established</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> the e-journal <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines included filtering <span>mechanism</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to identify <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>journal stock and this <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>an improvement on the more generic <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines that had been previously used. Inspection of bibliographies submitted prior to the project did not <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>any change in the way that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were carrying out research and this suggests that availability is not a catalyst, in itself, for the improvement in the scores to questions 2,7,16 and 17. </p>

<p>Many <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>receive formal research inductions at the start of Year 1 that include content similar to that presented in the project. This approach is at odds with the progressive approach advocated by <a href="#sco00">SCONUL (2000)</a> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy of concentrating training in Year 1 induction can be 
criticised firstly, as it will be <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with many other academic and social activities that <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>at that time, and secondly, as <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are not always <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to use the full <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of research skills in the first year of their studies. This <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of expectation will not encourage <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to invest in the time required to become <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with the <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>search techniques that the project team believe are <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for efficient identification of relevant articles. The timeliness of the e-journal induction (an assignment requiring 
research was issued on the same day) and of it being embedded in the Learning and Teaching process (as suggested in <a href="#rob01">Roberts, 2001</a>) ensured that the content was relevant and in the context of the immediate needs of <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Students were able to practice the lessons learnt at the same time 
as completing an assignment. The collaborative nature of the e-journal induction (delivery by academic and library staff) not only ensured that it was not viewed by <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as a bolt-on, but also empowered the lecturer to champion the lessons in the weeks that <span>followed</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>It became clear in the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>groups that some <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>invested a <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>amount of time in mastering the lessons learnt in the e-journal induction. The authors suspect that this investment was driven predominately by the inclusion of a specific assessment criterion in the assignment. This <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on assessment, supporting the views expressed in Gibbs et al. (<a href="#gib98">1998</a>), paints a disappointing image of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>not adopting a holistic approach to their learning. </p>

<h3>Analysis of journal citations </h3>

<p>The bibliographies submitted by the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with the assignment completed after the e-journal induction, were examined. Bibliographic <span>entries</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were categorised as being from a book, journal or website. The same categorisation was also performed on the bibliographies of thirty <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>who completed an equivalent assignment in previous occurrences of the module, but would not have attended an e-journal induction. The  data shown in Table 5 were obtained. </p>

<p>Significance <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was used to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>whether the number of journal bibliographic <span>entries</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>suggested that promoting e-journals had affected how <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were carrying out research to support their learning. It was assumed that the <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>data <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>a normal <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and so the difference in journal usage was tested using the standard <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for the difference between means, when two small <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are available. The null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>level and <span>formula</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for the calculated value of <em>t</em> are <span>formally</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>stated below </p>

<div align="center"><img src="p173Fig6.jpg" width="192" height="141" alt="fig6" /></div>

<p>The calculated value of <em>t</em> is 2.40, compared to a <em>t</em> 5% (df=58) 
  value of 1.67. This suggests that we must reject the null hypothesis at the 
  5% level and accept that promoting e-journals had affected how <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were 
  carrying out research to support their learning. The data are also significant 
  at the 1% level.</p>

<p>These data, the authors <span>suggest</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> are consistent with the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>changing the sources that they use for research, in a <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that was <span>emphasized</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the e-journal induction and reinforced by academic staff afterwards. It was <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that some overall increase in <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>would result from the efforts of staff, 
but that this increase (34%) derives principally from a 217% increase in the use of journals is very encouraging. It is slightly disappointing that the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>who had received the e-induction still included approximately the same number of Web site <span>entries</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(1.8 per bibliography) as other <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> as <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>had been placed on the potential unreliability of un-refereed websites.</p>

<h3>Focus groups</h3>

<p>Focus groups were organised towards the end of the project to enable the exploration of issues that had arisen. Two <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>groups, each including six <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were chaired by staff from the library and the proceedings were recorded onto audio tapes.</p>

<p>Members of both <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>groups highlighted the wish of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to receive effective 
  support, to enable them to fully exploit the potential of e-journals. Although 
  the consensus view of the e-journal <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was that of &quot;<em>a good 
  introduction</em>&quot;, one student expressed the <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that &quot;<em>it 
  took me another half <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to learn how..</em>&quot;. The contribution of this 
  student to the discussion suggests that this had been an effective exploratory 
  learning experience, in <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of Rieman (<a href="#rie96">1996</a>). 
  It had not been the intention to emphasise an exploratory learning <span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and 
  if this approach is adopted in <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>it would be necessary to specifically 
  engage <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in this strategy. Students' opinions were polarized on whether 
  e-journal induction should be delivered as traditional induction sessions or 
  embedded in the learning process, an approach recommended in Roberts (<a href="#rob00">2000</a>). 
  The anti-induction lobby argued that, as inductions are invariably included 
  as part of Freshers' Week, they attract variable attendance, they are missed 
  by both <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>entrants and <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>entrants, and they present material that is 
  more relevant in <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>years of the course. Both groups of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>agreed 
  that an induction might be better placed in Year 2, when <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> references 
  and bibliographical <span>entries</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>count towards assessment. Students advocating the 
  inclusion of learning support in <span>lectures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were split between those in favour 
  of dedicated study skills modules and those in favour of embedding the learning 
  in mandatory subject specific modules. It was suggested that &quot;<em>lecturers 
  should embed e-journals in the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>process to encourage interest</em>&quot; 
  by including more e-journals in <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>lists and providing keywords that can 
  be used for <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and also suggested that &quot;<em>e-booklets might 
  be introduced</em>&quot; to support exploratory learning.</p>

<p>The <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>offered <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the opportunity to articulate the <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>they had experienced. These included: </p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of off-campus access for the ACM package. </li>
<li>No <span>mechanism</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for filtering out e-journals that only <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>abstracts or required additional payment for a full-text service. </li>
<li>The erratic <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the ACM <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engine. </li>
<li>Frustrations experienced when <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>searching <span>prove</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>fruitless. </li>
<li>Problems with passwords </li>
</ul>

<p>It became clear that time is a critical factor in selecting resources, in <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with research in Roes (<a href="#ros">1999</a>). The completion of assignments in a short time frame was perceived by <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as being inconsistent with ordering paper articles using the inter-library loan system, even though such articles are normally delivered within one week. The benefits of instant access mean that the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are prepared to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>e-journals as a resource in learning, that is consistent with the &quot;<em>least effort research 
model</em>&quot; proposed by Chrzastowski (<a href="#chr99">1999</a>). <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> the availability of <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines potentially contributes to meeting their criteria for acceptability. One student was enthusiastic at no longer having to &quot;<em>browse paper journals</em>&quot; The requirement for timeliness could explain the nature of the <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>listed above. </p>

<p>It is also noted that, not surprisingly, some <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>con0ered some material &quot;<em>over my head</em>&quot;, but, surprisingly, some <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>had not <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the skill of evaluating an article by <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>abstract</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> but reverted to &quot;skimming the article&quot;. Perhaps this last observation is an 
indication that instant on-line access diminishes the importance of abstracts.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The challenge the team overcame was not one of persuading <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>from paper journals to e-journals, but of encouraging <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to use journals more generally. </p>

<p>The results <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the team's belief that success depended on the collaboration 
  of library and academic staff and on the timely embedding of the e-journal induction 
  in the learning process. The team did not see the initial e-journal induction 
  session, presented by library staff, as a bolt-on session. Instead it was one 
  part of a broader induction package that, critically, included academic staff 
  participating in the initial e-journal induction session as well as reinforcing 
  and championing the lessons learnt in <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>lectures</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> The e-journal induction 
  session was synchronised with the issue of an assignment that included a relevant 
  assessment criterion. This was also <span>crucial</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> in offering <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the immediate 
  incentive of using e-journals in a relevant assessment <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>The project team believe that the project was successful in enhancing the learning of those <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>who received the e-journal induction. This belief results from the increase in Research Quotient scores recorded by these <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> from the difference in research <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>profile (compared to other students) and from some of the thoughtful comments made in the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>groups.</p>

<p>Further reinforcement will be needed to ensure that the improvement in learning 
  and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is maintained, and so the team plan to embed the use of e-inductions 
  in other mandatory modules. Hopefully, other academic departments within UCW 
  can be encouraged to employ a similar strategy. The team is also mindful that 
  it must address its <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that both the condensed nature of assignment completion 
  and the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>placed by <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on assessment paint a disappointing image of 
  <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>not adopting a holistic approach to learning.</p>

<p>The need to review the delivery of the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>e-induction is anticipated. Perhaps, a revised initial e-induction session will <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>students to adopt an exploratory learning <span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and overcome the expectation of some that the induction is a complete learning experience in itself.</p>

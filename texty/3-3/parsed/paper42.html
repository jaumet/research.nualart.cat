    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>In July 1992, the Government launched <i><a href="#heal">The
        Health of the Nation,</a></i> (1992). Within the document five key areas
      of public health were identified as focal points for government policy and
      action: coronary heart disease and stroke, cancers, <span>mental</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>illness,
      accidents and HIV/AIDS and sexual health. Within each key area, national
      targets were set.</p>
    
    <p>The production of <i>The Health of the Nation, </i>was
      a definite shift in philosophy from the treatment of the illness in an
      individual to the development of a healthy nation of individuals.
      Prevention rather than cure had emerged as the way forward for public
      health. While some targets were vaguely determined, others were clearly
      stated, e.g.</p>
    
  
    <blockquote>&quot;... to reduce by at least 50% the rate of
      conceptions amongst the under sixteen&#146;s by the year 2000.&quot;(p.19)</blockquote>
    
    <p>Therefore the spotlight here is <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>focused upon
      the adolescent and their behaviour, and <span>ultimately</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>their use and recourse
      to health information in this specific area.</p>
    
    <p>Together with the <i><a href="#chil">Children's Act</a>
      1993, </i>and <i><a href="#audi">Children First</a>, <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span><span>Study</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of Hospital
      Services, 1993, </i>the need for good personal and written information for
      <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>is emphasised. It is highlighted in the <i>Children First </i>report,
      that 90% of all health care for <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>is provided by the primary
      sector, therefore it is imperative that health information for adolescents
      is available across the whole <span>spectrum</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the subject; not merely sexual
      behaviour and the use of drugs. Within <span>schools</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> awareness of health
      information for adolescents is provided within the context of Personal and
      <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>Education (PSE). However, recourse to adolescent needs is <span>limited</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>
      &quot;Censorship of some types of &quot;adult&quot; information, then, is
      constructed as legitimate before that information is deemed <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>for
      consumption by adolescents. The rationale for such censorship is that the
      innocence of <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and adolescents must be protected and maintained,
      even if the price this extracts is their continuation in a state of
      ignorance. Adolescents, therefore, are denied some information and, in
      contrast to most adults, are in a state of relative information poverty.&quot;
      (<a href="#kers">Kerslake &amp; Rolinson</a>, 1996:58). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>short regional
      study in<b> </b>the Department of Information and Library Studies at
      Loughborough University, funded by the School of Humanities, (now the
      Faculty of Science) aimed to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>this under-researched area .</p>
    
    <p>It is acknowledged that health information messages are
      thrown at adolescents from many directions, organisations and people:- the
      Department of Education and the Department of Health, NHS, Health
      Promotion, Family Planning clinics, pharmaceutical companies, doctors,
      <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>nurses, social workers and friends, youth organisations such as
      Scouts and Guides and of course, the mass media in various forms - teenage
      magazines, newspapers, television and the cinema. The <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the study
      was seen as a starting point to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>these conflicting messages.
      Trying to measure what health information is needed, and <i>where </i>and
      <i>how </i>it should be delivered is strewn with <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>because of
      the vast scope of the remit.</p>
    
    <h2>What is health information?</h2>
    
    <p>Health information may be defined as information on a
      continuum between health <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and health promotion. Therefore access
      to health information may contribute to health <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and promote
      healthy lifestyle choices. </p>
    <blockquote>
      
      &quot; Information is the first step to every healthy
        <span>choice</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> Improvements in our health <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>on us <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>control over, and
        responsibility for, health as an important component of our everyday
        lives. This active participation <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>full and continuing access to
        information: information about our <span>bodies</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> their workings in health and
        illness, and the services available to us in treatment and care, support
        and co-operation&quot; (<a href="#gann">Gann</a>, 1986)
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>A literature <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>has revealed little or no evidence
      of the expressed needs of adolescents addressed in the provision of health
      information within the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>setting.</p>
    
    <h2>Aims and objectives of the study</h2>
    
    <p>The aim of the study was to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>the needs for
      health information of a <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>set of Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire
      adolescents between the ages of 13 - 16 years. The study spanned both the
      private and the state sectors.</p>
    
    <p>The objectives were to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ascertain what the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>set of adolescents con0er
        to be their priorities for health information needs, if any.</li>
      <li>identify the various sources of information e.g.
        public library, GP surgery, <span>school</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span></li>
      <li>investigate the various media used for the
        communication of health information to adolescents</li>
      <li>identify best practice in the provision of health
        information</li>
      <li>identify the adolescents&#146; preferred <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and
        media for the provision of health information</li>
      <li>con0er if the adolescents&#146; expressed needs are
        reflected in recent government health legislation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Study protocol</h2>
    
    <p>The sensitive nature of personal health information,
      combined with seeking the views of adolescents dictated that the study
      <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>the various communications media used in the provision of
      health information for adolescents rather than the observation or
      monitoring of oral communication of such information on a one-to-one
      basis.</p>
    
    <h2>Focus of the study</h2>
    
    <p>The <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the study was adolescents within the
      <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> To achieve a <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>population across the whole <span>spectrum</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of
      society, it was decided to target a <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>population within the
      educational <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>including both the state and private sector.</p>
    
    <p>24 <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>were short listed within Leicestershire and

      into local <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>yet yield enough information for discussion in the
      wider context. The study population was a <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of 635 <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>aged 13 -
      16 years who were attending years 9,10 and 11 in 12 <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in
      Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. The gender split was approximately 50%
      boys and 50% girls. </p>
    
    <p>The <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>were selected to <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>the different
      types of communities within the two counties. Including schools
      representing the city area, a suburban area, a market town, a mining
      villages and a rural village, these were roughly matched across the two
      counties, although comparing the responses between the two counties was
      not part of the research protocol. Two Independent Schools, a girl&#146;s
      <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in Nottinghamshire and a boy&#146;s <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in Leicestershire, also
      <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>part of the study.</p>
    
    <p>Initial telephone calls were made to the <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to the

      ethical approval for the study. These initial telephone calls identified
      the member of staff who was responsible for <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>health information
      and who would be the contact for the study within the <span>school</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> Also the
      purpose and methodologies were also fully explained. All <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the
      study were confirmed in <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to the <span>schools</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
    
    <p>Data were collected using a questionnaire which sought
      information about the health information needs of the <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> They were
      completed in class time, with assistance and supervision from the teaching
      staff. The use of postal questionnaires was rejected as not being suitable
      because of the known low <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>rate to this methodology. Completion
      under supervision in the class room was con0ered <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in order to
      avoid the joint completion of the questionnaires by groups of students
      within the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>or elsewhere , and also non completion. Thus a high
      <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>rate of over 98% was <span>achieved</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> One-to-one interviews were also
      conducted with <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>staff responsible for, or involved in, delivering
      health information <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
    
    <p>Both quantitative and <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>data were <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in
      the study. The questionnaire was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to determine the adolescents
      understanding of health information and its importance in their
      lifestyles. It <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to find out if they had ever needed health
      information, and if so where they had obtained it. Their views were
      recorded on the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information in terms of needs met and if it
      was written in terms that could be <span>understood</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> or was it too technical.
      Finally the questionnaire asked for information on the sources that
      adolescents would prefer to use to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>health information. </p>

    <p>Although the percentages by gender show some
      differences, the sources are still ranked in closely the same order so
      that the top ranking macro information sources, for all respondents, were
      places and people. Within each of these groups, the top three selections
      were:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>in the places grouping: GP's surgery, dentists and
        opticians;</li>
      <li>in the written sources: leaflets, booklets and
        magazines;</li>
      <li>in the people grouping: doctors, parents and friends;
        and,</li>
      <li>in the multi-media grouping: television, video and
        films.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The absence from this listing of <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>nurses in the
      people grouping is unsurprising given the unequal provision of school
      nursing services in the two counties. Some <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>had a full time nurse
      on the premises, others had a part time nurse, and some only had a contact
      name.</p>
    
    <p>Internet resources are also noticeable by their absence
      from the top three multi-media information sources. They were used by
      merely 3% of respondents. This is surprising given the apparent IT and
      Internet awareness of adolescents and the encouraged and <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>use of
      IT <span>equipment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>schools</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> homes and public libraries. The evidence of the
      study shows that the availability of the Internet facilities within
      <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>was <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and not widely used.</p>
    
    <p>The use of a telephone help <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>as a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of health
      information was also recorded as surprisingly small, only 3% of
      respondents preferred this method of obtaining information. The success of
      &quot;Help for Health&quot;, &quot;Health Information First&quot; and the
      Trent Help Line do not appear to have penetrated the adolescent market.
      This is surprising given the availability and easy access to telephones
      within our society, and also the confidential and professional nature of
      the services provided. Yet the runaway success of the charity Childline,
      shows that a telephone service can be successful for <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>/
      adolescents. Therefore the study shows that the majority of adolescents
      prefer to talk to a professional face-to-face to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>health
      information.</p>
    
    <p>The previous use of health information above was
      contrasted in<b> </b>two ways with anticipated <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>use. First, one
      question aimed to gauge which sources adolescents were prepared to use to
      find health information. Responses showed that young people were happy to
      visit places (where the most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>selected category was 'GP's
      surgery'), use written sources (where the most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>selected
      category was 'leaflets'), to talk to people (where the most frequently
      selected category was 'parent') or to use multi-media (where the most
      <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>selected category was 'television' ) to get health information.
      Approximately two-thirds of the total respondents selected each of these
      categories.</p>
    
    <h2>Preferred Sources of Health Information</h2>
    
    <p>Respondents were asked for their preferred method of
      receiving health information across all macro groupings. Here responses
      were fairly evenly balanced between the places (27%), people (24%) and
      written sources (32%) macro groupings. The much-hyped multi-media sources
      were the preferred <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of health information for merely 9% of
      respondents. As this rejection is by young people who may well be the most
      <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>literature section of society, this should <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>a warning on
      the appropriateness of channelling substantial <span>amounts</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of health
      information via this <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> Within the 23 sub-groupings, the overall
      preference was to go to a GP's surgery ( selected by 16% of respondents )
      and the second preference was to talk to a doctor ( selected by 11% ). The
      difference in these two responses is that at a GP&#146;s surgery it may be
      possible to <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to another health professional other than the doctor
      i.e. the practice nurse or health visitor.</p>
    
    <h2>Future use of Health Sources</h2>
    
    <p>The <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>also examined the type of health information
      which respondents said they had previously needed and that which they
      anticipated needing in the <span>future</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

      The training of teachers in this particular field was reduced drastically

      Curriculum - key stages 3 and 4. </p>
    
    <p>The National Curriculum, Key Stage 3, section 2 - Humans
      as Organisms, (<a href="#depa">Department for Education</a>, 1995: 17,
      18) <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>the following subjects: nutrition, circulation, movement,
      reproduction, breathing, <span>respiration</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and health. Health had the following
      three specific points:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>that the abuse of alcohol, solvents and other drugs
        affects health;</li>
      <li>that <span>bacteria</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and viruses can affect health;</li>
      <li>that the body&#146;s natural defences may be enhanced
        by immunisations and medicines.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Reproduction has the following specific point about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the physical and emotional changes that take place
        during adolescence.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The issues surrounding these physical and emotional
      changes are, by their very nature, complex and difficult to explain in a
      group <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> They often <span>require</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> therefore, one-to-one <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and/or
      counselling, thus impinging on the all too little precious time available
      within the National Curriculum for Science. The depth of <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>required
      to fulfil the implications of the National Curriculum statement on the
      emotional changes that take place during adolescence really demands a
      <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>timetable slot other than the meagre allowance within science. In
      the study, it was <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>that this level of information provision was
      not successfully <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>within the PSE allocation. It would appear that
      <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>within <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in science <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>remains predominantly in the
      factorial not the pastoral. Indeed, reminiscent of Mr. Gradgrind in Dicken&#146;s
      &quot;Hard Times&quot;:</p>
    <blockquote>&quot; Now, what I want is, Facts. Teach these
      boys and girls nothing but Facts. Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant
      nothing else, and root out everything else. You can only form the <span>minds</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of
      reasoning <span>animals</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>on Facts: nothing else will ever be of any service to
      them. This is the principle on which I bring up my own <span>children</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> and this
      is the principle on which I bring up these Children. Stick to Facts, sir!&quot;
      (<a href="#dick">Dickens</a>,1974: 1) </blockquote>
    
    <p>Despite the differing standards in health information
      <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>observed in the study, and the declared anticipated needs of the
      adolescents for information surrounding sexual issues, &quot;Section 241
      of the Education Act 1993 gives parents the right to withdraw their
      <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>from any of all parts of a school&#146;s programme of sex
      <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> other than those elements which are required by the National
      Curriculum Science Order&quot; (<a href="#alle">Allen</a>, 1987: 20)</p>
    
    <p>Once again this emphasises the state of relative
      information poverty the adolescents can find themselves in if the parental
      right is exercised. However there is no evidence within the study to
      <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>that parents were exercising their right to withdraw <span>children</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
    
    <h2>Health Promotion Events</h2>
    
    <p>To increase general awareness of all health information
      issues, several <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>had taken the initiative to <span>hold</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>special events
      and open sessions for health professionals to bring the health information
      message to the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> The types of professionals invited to
      these events span the whole <span>spectrum</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of health care - <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>nurses,
      dieticians, beauty therapists, ophthalmologists and also the police
      specialist drug and rape teams. The most favoured times for these events
      was either immediately after <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>or lunch times. However on both
      occasions attendances by <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and parents had been very poor. On a
      rudimentary note the timing of the events, either lunch time or
      immediately after <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>closes are not conducive to the majority of
      working parents&#146; hours or for parents who look after family at home.
      Also given that these events were aimed at adolescents both parents and
      the adolescents may <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>that the <span>parental</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>accompanying role was
      unwelcome.</p>
    
    <p>Conscious effort has to be made by the adolescent to go
      to the event either during lunch time effectively whilst still at school
      or after <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span><span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>official hours. The objectives of these events
      were to bring health information professionals and adolescents together in
      a non threatening <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> to remove all <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>the
      right type of information and greatly improve access.</p>
    
    <p>However to attend this <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of event demands that the
      adolescent conforms in an information behavioural role, and is seen to
      conform to this model by others. Effectively an adolescent may have a
      passive interest in health information. However by attending a special
      event dedicated to the subject demands a paradigm shift from passive
      behaviour to active behaviour. This is obviously not a shift easily
      undertaken by the majority of adolescents in the study. It may not be
      con0ered &quot;cool&quot; to be seen seeking health information.</p>
    
    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    
    <p>Three <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>conclusions have arisen from this research:
      </p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>the shift of <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the adolescent&#146;s need
          for information about medical conditions to information relating to
          body image and sexuality;  </li>
        <li>the <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>schools</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> health information

          stages 3 and 4 of the National Curriculum, thus leaving little time
          for discussion of the emotional changes surrounding these issues; and,
        </li>
        <li>the apparent <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of a systematic approach to
          health information <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in either county or sector. </li>
      </ul></blockquote>
    
    <p>The evidence would <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>that health information needs
      of adolescents are not being fully met within the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>setting.
      </p>
    
    <p>As the second phase of this research, the conclusions
      have been explored with <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>groups of adolescents from the <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>which
      participated in the study reported here, to achieve a greater
      understanding of their health information needs. </p>

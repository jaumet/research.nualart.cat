    <h2><font color="navy">Introduction</font></h2>
    
    <p>After a period of silent activity, public health as a scientific field
      has re-established itself in Germany over the last few years. Several
      public health research consortiums have supported researchers from such
      disciplines as medicine, sociology, psychology and engineering in focusing
      on the study of the health care system, the epidemiology of various
      diseases and health conditions, the national health service, and
      environmental health. At the same time some Schools of Public Health have
      introduced postgraduate programmes in order to cultivate a specifically
      educated Public Health community. But nevertheless, Public Health in
      Germany is still suffering from the lack of a responsible national
      governmental Public Health organisation (like the NHS or the CDC&#146;s)
      which would be able to co-ordinate the several activities. </p>
    
    <p>There is also no well established informational infrastructure to offer
      researchers, as well as other experts, an overview of current research
      activities and recently published literature. Therefore, a preliminary
      study based at the Institute for Health Sciences at the Technical
      University Berlin and funded by the German Ministry of Health is assessing
      the informational needs in Public Health research and practice. The
      objectives of the study are to develop a design for a supplementary
      documentation about Public Health projects in Germany and to identify the
      benefits of new Internet online procedures for Public Health practice and
      research. As a first step, an information exchange office (figure 1) began
      in September 1996 to assess the demand for high-quality information in
      Public Health research and to evaluate researchers' experiences with the
      use of databases and other online procedures.</p>
    
    <p align="center"><img src="p43f01.gif" hspace="9" width="472" height="330"></p>
    
    <p align="center">Figure 1.: Home page of the Public Health Information
      Exchange Office</p>
    
    <h2><font color="navy">Method</font></h2>
    
    <p>A survey about the experience with online databases and demands for
      specific information resources was conducted during August 1996 in order
      to analyse the extent of problems experienced with information retrieval.
      A questionnaire, including questions (59 variables) about the main areas
      of specialty, ordinary information searching strategies, experiences with
      literature and fact databases, information needs, and technical equipment
      was developed and sent to 585 key persons. </p>
    
    <p>The response rate was 38% (n=217). Without a special subsample of
      non-Public Health scientists from the Technical University itself, the
      response rate increases to 44%.</p>
    
    <p>It can be assumed from comments given by non-respondents that these
      persons did not identifying themselves as Public Health professionals and
      thus refused to answer the questionnaire. In the subsample which included
      all sorts of scientists at the Technical University of Berlin, the
      response rate was only about 21%. </p>
    
    <p>Because of the expected professional ability for using the new
      technologies, key persons with no or little experience with databases or
      online communications avoided participating in the survey. Therefore the
      rate of active Internet users, or at least connected key persons, is
      probably overestimated. </p>
    
    <h2><font color="navy">The Sample</font></h2>
    
    <p>As Public Health is a field associated with many different professions,
      institutions and tasks, the sample was supposed to cover several specific
      Public Health subjects and places of work. Most of the respondents (72%)
      are working in research institutions. Those working in governmental
      organisations and those working as health care providers each make up 10%
      of the sample. The proportions of the various places of work are similar
      to the proportions of these groups in the respondent address pool. While
      there is no reliable estimate of a representative Public Health sample, no
      statements can be made about the general representativity of the sample
      used in this study.</p>
    
    <p>Another important variable of the sample are the different tasks and
      subject areas the respondents named as their areas of speciality (figure
      2).</p>
    
    <p align="center"><img src="p43f02.gif" width="550" height="368"></p>
    
    <p align="center">Figure 2. Areas of speciality of respondents</p>
    
    <h2><font color="navy">Results</font></h2>
    
    <h3><font color="teal">Information behaviour</font></h3>
    
    <p>In order to get a picture about the information behaviour in general,
      some results about the preferred information resources are useful. Print
      media are the most preferred information resource, although the
      face-by-face information transfer in scientific meetings and discussions
      with colleagues play a important role. In this way the quality and
      reliability of the information is substantiated by the reputation of the
      authors or editors themselves or due to the peer-reviewed selection. In
      fact the lack of editing and peer-review procedures are the main arguments
      against the reliability of information retrieval via Internet.</p>
    
    <p>Databases for research are used by about two-thirds of the respondents;
      nearly a third of them access the databases via Internet. The most
      experienced group of online database users are respondents working as
      research fellows (over 60%), while only one-third of professors do their
      online research by themselves.</p>
    
    <p>There is also a difference between the academic and non-academic
      respondents in using information services. While about 30% of the
      non-academic respondents charge information services to do their database
      research, only 18% of the academics are using these services. The
      difference is probably due to the fact of fewer financial resources and
      typical academic habits, but certainly also of better technical resources:
      about 67% of the academic respondents have access to the Internet in
      comparison to only 51% of the non-academics.</p>
    
    <h3><font color="teal">Technical Equipment</font></h3>
    
    <p>The overall results about technical equipment and Internet use are shown
      in the table below (Table 1). About two-thirds of respondents connected to
      the Internet are active Internet services users. As the results of the
      survey show, the most common service of all is email with a use rate of
      78% for connected respondents. </p>

    <p>How satisfying a database query for the respondents has been seems to be
      a question of how good the counselling service was. The chances of being
      satisfied with the result of a database research is 50% higher for
      respondents who have received a good database counselling before the
      search was done. In general 46% of the respondents are choosing a database
      without a counselling service. Additionally 35% of respondents who used
      counselling services complained about the quality of the databases&#146;
      consultation (Table 2), and over a third were unable to rate the service.</p>

    <p>One of the most serious problems reported by respondents in the survey
      is that only very little German literature is documented in the main
      Public Health databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE or HEALTH. About
      two-thirds reported missing German literature in the databases they
      normally use, although there are two original German databases HECLINET
      and SOMED, covering the main areas of Public Health.</p>
    
    <p>That it is still difficult for users to find specialised databases is
      obvious according to the responses about missing Public Health databases.
      About 73% reported missing databases, especially containing
      epidemiological data, data useful for Health Planing decisions, data on
      women&#146;s health or health promotion. Due to the fact that it is very
      difficult to find qualified partners for co-operation and research
      experts, a proposed database about ongoing and recently completed Public
      Health projects was supported by 70% of the respondents. </p>
    
    <h2><font color="navy">Conclusions</font></h2>
    
    <p>The main conclusions of the survey findings are:</p>
    
    <p>(a) there is a serious demand for information filtering and information
      supply in Public Health in Germany in order to raise the quality of
      database queries and to give all involved players (e.g. researchers,
      governmental organisations, providers, funding institutions) a reliable
      overview of the current status of the various areas of speciality,</p>
    
    <p>(b) as other investigations have showed, some of the &quot;missed&quot;
      databases do already exist, but are obviously not well known or
      accessible, thus indicating a need of promoting information resources and
      providing a counselling service,</p>
    
    <p>(c) although some of the respondents have had access to the Internet,
      only very few of them were using email or the world wide web to find and

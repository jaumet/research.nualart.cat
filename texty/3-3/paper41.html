    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    
    <p>The efficiency and efficacy of an organisation as big as
      the British National Health Service (NHS) rests heavily on the use of
      appropriate technologies by its staff, both clinical and non-clinical.
      Computer technology, in particular, can be used to do routine jobs that
      would otherwise require more manpower and, as we illustrate here, make
      information available more widely to the benefit of those who need to use
      it. Of particular interest to us is how the Internet, the so-called
      Information Super-highway that is now becoming prevalent in both the home
      and workplace, could be used to benefit doctors and their patients.</p>
    
    <p>The NHS is based on a primary health care model.
      Patients requiring treatment first visit their General Practitioner, a
      clinician with a wide range of expertise. If the GP feels unable to treat
      the patient, he or she will refer the patient to a consultant specialising
      in the relevant area of medicine. The normal mechanism for doing this is
      for the GP to write a letter (called a referral letter) to the consultant.
      How does the GP choose the consultant?</p>
    
    <p>Firstly, there may be several consultants for any given
      specialty at one hospital, or there may not be any at all. Frequently
      within a specialty, individual consultants will have particular interests
      or experience. For example, one orthopaedist might have particular
      interest in hands while another is interested in feet. It would be
      beneficial to both patient and consultant if an appropriate referral could
      be made.</p>
    
    <p>Secondly, the funding structure of the NHS limits
      spending by limiting the supply of health care. Waiting lists build up for
      non-emergency treatments, particularly outpatient consultations with
      consultants. These waiting lists can vary greatly from consultant to
      consultant for the same treatment. While there is some debate over what a
      short waiting list indicates, this is information that the GP might wish
      to use in deciding which consultant to choose.</p>
    
    <p>Our work started from the hypothesis that GPs <i>would</i>
      like more accurate and more timely information about waiting lists when
      referring patients to consultants, and that Internet technology might be a
      suitable way of delivering that information. The latter is a realistic
      proposition since virtually all GPs have some sort of computer system in
      their surgery and, while only a few are at present connected to the
      Internet, the equipment and software necessary to do so is relatively
      cheap and easy to install. Our aim was to develop a prototype of a system
      to show the validity of the concept, after talking to GPs and hospitals to
      establish what was feasible and what was required.</p>
    
    <h2>Information that GPs wanted from the system</h2>
    
    <p>A number of GPs located in the South of England were
      interviewed in the summer of 1996 to find what they would like to see in
      an information system that provided them with up-to-date information from
      hospitals (<a href="#brad">Bradley, 1996</a>).
      The process was one of eliciting requirements for the system rather than a
      statistical study of referral patterns.</p>
    
    <p>The GPs described the factors that affected their
      decision as to which consultant to refer a patient. The factors identified
      were:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>locality to patient;</li>
      <li>waiting time for treatment;</li>
      <li>patient preference;</li>
      <li>knowledge of the consultant;</li>
      <li>the consultant&#146;s special interests;</li>
      <li>the performance of the consultant or unit; and</li>
      <li>the cost of the treatment.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Each GP ranked the factors they had identified in order
      of importance. The differences were considerable. For example, one ranked
      performance indicators as being very important, another dismissed them as
      being too crude to merit consideration.</p>
    
    <p>All of the GPs agreed that they would like more
      information that was more up to date than they presently receive.
      Information about waiting list times came at best monthly by post, and was
      out of date as soon as it was printed. Knowledge of consultants and their
      specialities was normally by personal contact or personal accumulation of
      experience by the GP. There was no catalogue of consultants&#146;
      particular interests so that patients could be referred to the appropriate
      person. Consultants sometimes publish &quot;protocols&quot; - documents
      describing the way that they like patients to be managed before they are
      referred to an outpatient clinic. One GP said that he would like an
      information system to provide him with these protocol documents so that he
      could manage patients in the way preferred by the particular consultant.
      Consultants might be more enthusiastic about writing the documents if they
      knew that they would be easily available to (and used by) their target
      audience</p>
    
    <p>The GPs were enthusiastic about a system that could
      deliver up-to-date information about waiting lists, consultants&#146;
      interests and other information to them as they made their referral
      decisions.</p>
    
    <h2>Hospitals&#146; willingness and ability to provide
    information</h2>
    
    <p>The IT managers of two hospital trusts on the south
      coast of England were interviewed later in the summer of 1996. Both
      hospitals welcomed the concept of providing GPs with more information
      about the services they offer, particularly information about waiting list
      times and the special interests of consultants.</p>
    
    <p>One IT manager described the proposed system as
      providing an additional window onto the hospital&#146;s information. It
      has an open link to its proprietary hospital information system that it
      can use to create new applications, including an application such as this.
      The hospital already has most of the hardware and software that it would
      need for the application. The manager thought that it would not be too
      difficult to implement the hospital end of the system.</p>
    
    <p>Between them, the hospitals identified a number of
      issues that would need to be addressed before the system could be fully
      implemented. Firstly, there are no standard measures for waiting list
      times. Each hospital measures the time a patient must wait for an
      appointment in a different way - the discrepancies normally arising from
      different ways of calculating the start of the wait. This could be when
      the GP writes the referral letter or when the patient is sent a letter
      telling him or her about their appointment.</p>
    
    <p>The second problem arises from the definition of
      urgency. The seriousness of a patient&#146;s condition will determine the
      time the patient must wait for an appointment. Consultants manage their
      diaries to accommodate this: they have different slots for different
      grades of urgency. Each consultant, however, will have different levels of
      urgency - &quot;urgent&quot; might mean &quot;within 7 days&quot; to one, &quot;within
      21 days&quot; to another. GPs need some standard way of comparing like
      with like.</p>
    
    <h2>Functionality of the GP application</h2>
    
    <p>We designed the GP application to query hospitals for
      information and display the information they return to the user. The
      prototype application is limited to outpatient appointment information,
      but could be extended to provide other forms of query. The user specifies
      the specialty - such as &quot;general medicine&quot; - and the urgency -
      such as &quot;routine&quot;.</p>
    
<div>  <img src="p41f01.gif" width="576" height="162"></div>
    
    <div><br>Figure 1 - The query interface</div>
    
    <p>When the query command is invoked, the application
      requests information from different hospitals and displays it
      appropriately to the user. The prototype application displays the
      information as a table, each hospital having a number of consultants and
      each consultant offering a number of clinics, etc. </p>
    
    <p>As the user moves the mouse over the rows for a
      particular consultant, a box at the bottom of the screen gives a brief
      description of the consultant&#146;s interests. (In Figure 2, Dr Virchov
      is shown to have a special interest in cystic fibrosis.) Hospitals,
      consultants and treatments can have World Wide Web (WWW) pages associated
      with them, either in Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML) format or
      otherwise. The information returned by a hospital includes the Uniform
      Resource Locator (URL) for it if one is available. If the user clicks on
      any of these, the application launches a web browser showing the
      appropriate page.</p>
    
    <p>The presentation of the information in the prototype
      application is basic. A more refined version might use tree views instead
      of a table, and allow the user to make comparisons between different
      treatments at different hospitals.</p>
    
    <div><img src="p41f02.gif" width="564" height="429"></div>
    
    <div><br>Figure 2 - Results of the query</div>
    
    <h2>Architecture of the system</h2>
    
    <h3>Overall architecture</h3>
    
    <p>The system is designed with a client-server architecture
      (Figure 3). Each user application (the client) makes its own network
      connections to hospital servers to request information about treatments.
      Each hospital may operate a web server to provide WWW documents to users
      on its network. The system integrates tightly with any such web pages that
      may be available.</p>
    
    <div><a name="_926513688"></a><img src="p41f03.gif" width="555" height="284"></div>
    
    <div><a name="_Ref389642981"><br>Figure </a>3 - Architecture of the system</div>
    
    <p>Communication takes place via the TCP/IP group of
      protocols. The aim of the design was to be as independent as possible of
      the particular type of computer the GP and hospital would be using, to
      cater for the wide range of software and hardware used in the NHS.</p>
    
    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    
    <p>The prototype user application is a Java applet (<a href="#arno">Arnold
        &amp; Gosling, 1996</a>). A Java applet is a
      small application that can run inside a Java-enabled web browser such as
      <b>Netscape Navigator</b> or <b>Internet Explorer</b>. A special HTML
      tag instructs the browser to download and execute the application. Thus
      each time the user wishes to start the application, a new version of the
      software is downloaded. Problems of installing the latest version of
      applications on individual users&#146; workstations are all but
      eliminated.</p>
    
    <p>Writing the application in Java brings other benefits
      apart from being able to run the application as an applet. Web browsers
      are able to run Java applets by implementing a Java virtual machine (as
      defined by Sun Microsystems)(<a href="#lind">Lindholm
        &amp; Yellin, 1996</a>). Wherever the Java
      virtual machine is implemented, a Java application will run. Java
      applications are compiled to machine-independent bytecodes interpreted by
      the virtual machine (Figure 4). The Java virtual machine has been
      implemented and is available on many platforms including Windows, OS/2,
      many flavours of UNIX, AS400s and MVS. It is also possible to write
      compilers for languages other than Java that compile to Java bytecodes -
      one such compiler has been written for Ada.</p>
    
    <div><a name="_Ref389627471"></a><img src="p41f04.gif" width="494" height="483"></div>
    
    <div><a name="_Ref389643124"><br>Figure </a>4 - Java machine independence</div>
    
    <p>If a text based (rather than graphical) user interface
      were written (<a href="#coll">Collins, 1995</a>),
      the system could run on any machine that had a Java virtual machine
      implementation. The application would be a program rather than an applet,
      however, so the bytecode files would need to be available on local disk
      storage rather than be dynamically downloaded via a web browser.</p>
    
    <h3>Format of data</h3>
    
    <p>In our system, hospitals return information to the GP
      application in a format defined in Structured General Mark-up Language
      (SGML)(<a href="#gold">Goldfarb, 1995</a>).
      SGML is a platform-neutral notation for the specification of a data
      structure. The definition of a data structure is contained in a Document
      Type Definition. Data is broken down into entities. Entities can have
      child entities - in our case, hospitals have consultants, consultants have
      treatments and treatments have performance indicators.</p>
    
    <p>Data in SGML format is entirely text based, making it
      particularly appropriate for an application that is seeking to avoid any
      reliance on particular platforms. The SGML definition for the hospitals&#146;
      data is relatively simple, so as to minimise the effort required
      for a hospital to offer information to GPs in this way.</p>
    
    <h2>Issues not addressed</h2>
    
    <p>The GPs interviewed all thought that as well as getting
      extra information about treatments, they would like to be able to make a
      booking on-line. The IT managers of the hospitals were not unreceptive to
      this idea, but thought that the consultants working in the hospital might
      resist the change from a consultant-led to a GP-led booking process. An
      intermediate stage might be for the GP to be able to email the referral
      letter to the hospital, and for them to print it out and deal with it in
      the conventional way. The prototype system does not at present allow GPs
      to make online bookings.</p>
    
    <p>This work does not consider the security of the system.
      If the system is limited to providing information about treatments,
      patient confidentiality is not compromised. Hospitals might, however, wish
      to restrict access to their information to authorised individuals. If this
      were the case, some kind of authentication of users would be necessary. If
      the system were expanded to any kind of booking functionality, patient
      details would need to be kept secure. It is likely that an application of
      this kind would run on the NHS&#146;s private network and use encryption
      techniques, thereby reducing the risk of private individuals gaining
      access to confidential information.</p>
    
    <p>It would be necessary to provide a web server from which
      the applet could be downloaded by web browsers running on users&#146;
      workstations. If desired, this web server could support many users:
      perhaps all of the GPs in a city. The same machine might also provide the
      service of specifying suitable hospitals for the applet to query. </p>
    
    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    
    <p>This work has shown that GPs want more information and
      that hospitals are broadly willing and able to provide it. We have shown
      how Internet technology could provide a cheap, manageable and timely means
      of delivering the information to the GP's surgery. That this provides a
      higher level of service for the patient is for others to judge, but we
      believe we have shown that the technology is there to make it possible.</p>

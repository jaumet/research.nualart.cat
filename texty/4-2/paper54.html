<h2><font color="navy">Introduction</font></h2> 

</p>The last few years have seen a number of changes in the higher
education sector which have exerted pressure upon the traditional
role of the academic library:
<ul>
<li>rapid growth in student numbers.  This is not mirrored by
a relative increase in the number of Library and Information Services
(LIS) staff.
<li>growth in non-traditional students, for example mature students
and part-time students who have different needs and expectations
from the eighteen year old school leaver.
<li>inflation in the cost of printed materials.
<li>growing numbers of academic publications. 
<li>falling library budgets as a percentage of the total institutional
budget.
<li>changes in teaching and learning methods, towards a greater
emphasis on student centred learning.
<li>technological developments.
</ul>

<p>

<p>
This latter change, the increase in the amount of electronic information
sources available, has been significant within LIS.  It is costly,
results in a demand for information skills training for both staff
and students and is causing a radical transformation within LIS,
involving a shift from an original emphasis upon holding material
towards the importance of being a gateway to networked information,
providing access rather than holdings.
<p>
Students constitute one part of society who are fortunate to have
access, at no cost to themselves, to a variety of electronic information
resources. Universities use considerable proportions of their
budgets to provide this technology for their students to assist
in the learning process.  How do students themselves feel about
the availability of electronic information, which may require
the acquisition of new skills to utilise effectively?  Little
is known about student attitudes towards this form of information
provision and without a better understanding, it is difficult
for service providers to know if they are meeting the needs of
students effectively.
<p>
This paper aims to contribute to the limited information on students'
views of electronic information resources.
<p>
<h2><font color="navy">JANET</font></h2>
<p>
The availability of the Joint Academic Network (JANET) provides
free access at the point of use to the Internet as well as to
a number of information services supported by the Joint Information
Systems Committee (JISC), for students and staff members within
United Kingdom academic institutions.  These information services
include Mailbase, offering an information sharing service;  Bulletin
Board for Libraries (BUBL),  providing a description of Internet
resources and a current awareness service;  National Information
Services (NISS) which provides a focal point to the United Kingdom
research committees to enable them to access information resources
world-wide, and UKOLN, the UK Office of Library Networking, oncerned
with the use of networks by the library community.  Dependant
upon individual university subscriptions, students have a number
of on-line databases available to them.  These include BIDS, EDINA
and OCLC FirstSearch, all of which provide references to journal
articles for registered users.  Via JANET, users can also access
the OPACs of many United Kingdom University libraries as well
as several specialist collections.  JANET is being replaced by
SuperJANET, which has a network capacity 1000 times faster than
JANET.  In conjunction with these technological advances, many
stand alone CD-ROMs, which have been in operation for the last
decade, are being increasingly networked, providing access from
any networked computer terminal in the institution not solely
within the library itself, hence improving user accessibility.
<p>
<h2><font color="navy">Advantages of Electronic Sources</font></h2>
<p>
Electronic information sources offer today's students different
opportunities from their predecessors.  <a href="#refs">Brophy</a> (1993)
details the advantages of networking for the user as being: the
information needed can be delivered from the most appropriate
source to the user; the user can re-specify his or her needs dynamically;
the information is obtained when it is wanted, so becomes &quot;just
in time&quot; rather than &quot;just in case&quot;; the user selects
only the information needed to answer the specific question and,
finally, the information is only stored should the user wish.
 Electronic information can therefore provide a number of advantages
over traditional print based sources.
<p>
These advantages include the fact that electronic information
sources are often faster than consulting print indexes, especially
when searching retrospectively, and they are more straight forward
when wishing to use combinations of keywords.  They open up the
possibility of searching multiple files at one time, a feat accomplished
more easily than when using printed equivalents.  Electronic resources
can be printed and searches saved to be repeated at a later date;
they are updated more often than printed tools.  One main advantage,
especially to distance learners or those with limited time to
access the library, is their availability from outside the library
by dial-up access.
<p>
<h2><font color="navy">Information Skills</font></h2>
<p>
In order to utilise the growing range of electronic resources,
students must acquire and practice the skills necessary to exploit
them.  &quot;For students using a variety of on-line databases,
it is as though they were parking lot attendants, where every
vehicle is not only a different make and model but has a different
configuration&quot; (<a href="#refs">Blandy & Libutti, 1995</a>: 291).  As <a href="#refs">Dutton</a>
(1990)<b> </b>suggests, the skills required to maximise
the potential of electronic resources are much greater than those
required for searching printed sources.  These skills include
a knowledge of the structure of the database and the instructions
which must be input into the computer by the searcher, as well
as an understanding of the ways in which the instructions are
linked with one another.  To this end, <a href="#refs">Brophy</a> (1993)
states users do not often appreciate the skills required to search
these sources, stating they are deceptively easy to use.
<p>
The ability to find and retrieve information effectively is a
transferable skill useful for future life as well as enabling
the positive and successful use of the electronic  resources whilst
at university.  As Brophy argues, libraries must &quot;reach a
position where the acquisition of information skills is acknowledged
as one of the key learning objectives for every student entering
a university, so that no student leaves without being fully equipped
to cope with the information intensive world - the information
society - as an end-user&quot; (<a href="#refs">Brophy, 1993</a>: 55)
<p>
<h2><font color="navy">User Surveys</font></h2>
<p>
There is a noticeable gap in the literature about student perceptions
towards electronic information, as Brittain noted, &quot;most
user studies have looked at the situation through the eyes of
the information professionals, rather than the user&quot; (<a href="#refs">Bawden,
1990</a>: 41).  A number of surveys do exist, in the main relating
to the use of CD-ROM, but are significantly lacking considering
the amount of technology available.  The views of users should
be a vital form of analysis into the effectiveness of these sources,
as well as enabling the varying needs of students to be met, and
monitored.  &quot;While user surveys can never tell the whole
story of how patrons are responding to a library service, they
can provide valuable ideas about what does and does not work&quot;
(<a href="#refs2">Faries, 1992</a>: 147).  It is only under these circumstances that
effective responses can be made to deal with any possible user
reactions, either positive or negative.
<p>
<h2><font color="navy">Case Studies</font></h2>
<p>
 Results generated from four of the studies undertaken are detailed
below, although they relate solely to the use of CD-ROMs and were
undertaken during the 1980s.  Regardless of this, the results
are interesting and essentially useful to bear in mind when discussing
the varying opinions held by the sample population providing data
for this paper.
<p>
 General user opinion towards the use of electronic resources,
in particular CD-ROM, has been positive, with students enjoying
using these sources and finding relatively few problems while
using them.  Surveys undertaken at Oakland University (<a href="#refs2">Schultz
& Salomon, 1990</a>) into student satisfaction with CD-ROMs
discovered that:
<ul>
<li>83% of students surveyed felt that using this source saved
them time, and found it relatively easy to use  
<li>Two-thirds of those surveyed stated that if the CD-ROM was
busy, they would wait for it to become free rather than use the
print tool
<li>85% would choose this version over print. 
</ul>

<p>

<p>
Similarly, Beecham Pharmaceuticals' Research Division (<a href="#refs2">Goldfinch,
1990
</a>)<b> </b>produced a survey regarding end user searching
of CD-ROM and results showed:
<ul>
<li>it was easy to use
<li>it saved time in library searching.
</ul>

<p>

<p>
<a href="#refs">Allen</a> (1989)<b> </b>looked at a number of studies undertaken
to analyse patron response to using bibliographic databases on
CD-ROM in academic libraries and found that:-
<ul>
<li>users thought CD-ROMs could be used without prior knowledge
or training
<li>that satisfactory answers were gained for their queries
<li>that patrons prefer CD-ROM to comparable printed reference
tools
<li>that the majority of patrons found CD-ROM easy to use
</ul>

<p>

<p>
The issue of users' opinions of <i>satisfactory</i> results must
be approached with care, as satisfactory may have a different
connotation in the mind of the student than the mind of an information
professional.  For instance, a number of questionnaires were distributed
to end users at Hofstra University (<a href="#refs">Day et al., 1996</a>) with
the result that a high percentage of respondents were satisfied
with the outcome of their searching.  However, the librarians
were concerned students were interested in high recall rather
than high precision.  Similarly, Culbertson found in a study of
students using science and engineering CD-ROM databases that although
end-users could obtain and print results, few used refining techniques
(<a href="#refs">Culbertson, 1992</a>).
<p>
 Finally, a survey was undertaken by <a href="#refs">Biddiscombe</a> (1996) to provide an international snapshot of the use of networks by academic library users.  Comments included:
<ul>
<li>easier searching for information, both in terms of the wider
range of databases and the ability to search by keyword
<li>time saved through using one interface 
<li>the ability to search the catalogues of other libraries
</ul>

<p>
Of those surveyed, 79% were happy with the results produced.
<p>
 Clearly, the views from users of electronic resources are favourable
and provide some justification for the financial investment in
installing and maintaining these systems in academic libraries.
<p>
<h2><font color="navy">University Staff Perceptions</font></h2>
<p>
Data collected by the IMPEL2 team in 1996-97 via interviews and
focus groups with library, academic, computing and related support
staff, provides evidence about how these members of staff perceive
the emerging relationship between electronic information resources
and students.  This complements data collected via the two questionnaires.
<p>
<h3><font color="teal">Knowledge of IT</font></h3>
<p>
There is a growing divide between the capabilities of students
entering higher education in their use of electronic information
resources.
<p>

<blockquote><blockquote><i>&quot;You have the people that rush up on day one....saying
where's e-mail, BIDS, e-journals...and then you have the people...saying
I don't know anything about this&quot;. </i> (Assistant Librarian)

</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
This highlights the pressure exerted upon LIS and academic staff.
 Information skills training, aimed at the whole university needs
to take into account the varying abilities of the students.
<p>
<h3><font color="teal">Raised expectations</font></h3>
<p>
Students entering higher education appear to have raised expectations
about the capabilities of electronic resources.   
<p>

<blockquote><blockquote><i>&quot;In some cases they seem to think that there is a button
they can press and it will write an essay for them...so to the
students it is a big disappointment&quot; </i> (Senior Library Assistant).

</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
This denotes a lack of awareness of the full potential and function
of electronic resources.  Today's students may be more sophisticated
than their predecessors in using some of the basic functions of
many systems, however many  are clearly unaware of the limitations
and uses of many electronic sources of information.
<p>
<h3><font color="teal">Over reliance on IT</font></h3>
<p>
There appears to be an emerging over reliance upon electronic
information resources at the expense of the more traditional forms
of information.  
<p>

<blockquote><blockquote><i>&quot;students will say to me..  they don't want books, they
just want it up on the screen...and if they can't get it up on
the screen they are not interested&quot;.</i> (Senior Library Assistant)

</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
In view of the debate over access rather than holdings, this attitude
amongst students may seem encouraging.  However, the importance
of print-based information must not be dismissed and it is essential
for students to be aware that electronic resources and print-based
resources complement each other.
<p>
<h2><font color="navy">Methodology</font></h2>
<p>
The rationale behind this study lay in two separate, but closely
related projects: the IMPEL2 Project and an MA Information and
Library Management Dissertation which focused upon student attitudes
towards electronic information at one United Kingdom University
(<a href="#refs2">Ray, 1997</a>).   
<p>
IMPEL2 (Impact on People of Electronic Libraries) a JISC-funded
Electronic Libraries Programme (eLib) Project based at the University
of Northumbria (<a href="#refs">Day et al., 1996</a>), monitored organisational, cultural
and human aspects of electronic library development.  Specifically,
the study focused upon the impacts of the electronic library on
qualified LIS staff and related support staff, academic staff
and students.  It examined the impacts on LIS of Resource Based
Learning and studied the implications for staff training and development.
 Research for this project was undertaken at 24 institutions and
provided a vast array of qualitative and quantitative data.  
<p>
Within the IMPEL study, 155 questionnaires were collected from
students at two universities about their attitudes towards electronic
information resources.  The students were studying the following
courses: Pharmacy, Business Administration; Law; Transport Management
and Logistics and Marine Geography.  One university (Case Study
A) was situated on a single, compact, inner city campus with only
a small number of students (5,100) and acquired University status
in 1966.  This University had several PC labs offering 24 hour
access, offered orientation tours to new students, had extensive
printed guides to assist students with retrieval skills and had
an Information Technology Training Series placed on the Internet
for users.  The second university (Case Study B) was a major civic
university dating back to 1883 and consisting of approximately
14,000 students.  This university had just acquired funding to
create teaching suites within four libraries.  Analysis of this
student data is discussed in this paper.
<p>
This data was validated by a study of 162 students at a single
institution, undertaken across a range of subject areas, using
the same methodology as the IMPEL student survey.  This university
(Case Study C) was awarded University status in 1992 and has over
15,000 students.  It offers an Information Skills module (Level
1) to all students which is accredited to a student's course and
all students are provided with an induction work book to provide
'hands-on' experience of the basic library services.
<p>
<h2><font color="navy">Results</font></h2>
<p>
As expected, a wide variety of views were expressed by the sample
population, but the main findings suggest that although many respondents
do use some electronic resources, only a limited number were being
used.  In order to determine whether degree choice influences
attitudes towards electronic resources, respondents were categorised
depending upon subject studied.  Where results from these groups
deviated significantly from the sample population results this
will be highlighted.
<p>
<blockquote><blockquote><b>Question</b>:  <i>Do you have access to a networked computer
at university or at home?</i>

</blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
91% of respondents acknowledged access to a networked computer
via university, a figure which was expected.  Also, 17 students
(5.4%) acknowledged access at home as well as the university.
 Although a relatively low percentage of students, this figure
should increase over the next few years, paralleling the growing
popularity of electronic resources and the slowly decreasing cost
of purchasing equipment.  The International Data Corporation state
&quot;more Internet access is from work (or university or college)
than from home, but this is estimated to be evened out by the
year 2000&quot; (<a href="#refs2">Winship, 1996</a>: 6).  Eight respondents (2.5%) failed
to indicate access to a networked computer via any means.  Allowing
for a number of these respondents failing to answer the question,
this does pose some concern over whether some of the respondents
did not understand the terminology of &quot;network&quot;.
<p>

<p align="center"><blockquote><blockquote><b>Question</b>: <i>Which electronic resources do you use?</i></blockquote></blockquote></p>

<p align="center"><img src="p54fig1.gif"></p>

<p>
<h4>The Internet and CD-ROMs</h4>
<p>
As expected the most popular electronic resources were CD-ROMs
and the Internet, with 80.7% and 76.7% respectively of the sample
population using them.  As many Schools and College of Further
Education invest in the Internet and a range of CD-ROMs, many
students are provided with the opportunity to use these resources
prior to entering higher education, which may improve their popularity.

<p>
<h5><i>Subject Analysis</i></h5>
<ul>
<li>100% of respondents studying computer studies used both CD-ROMs
and the Internet, a result to be expected due to the emphasis
of this subject on technology and therefore coursework may well
be dependent upon successful use of these resources.
</ul>

<p>

<ul>
<li>Only 47.6% of students studying education used the Internet,
a small percent for an electronic resource with a perceived high
popularity.  As the same students displayed high figures for CD-ROM
use (95.2%) suggesting that academic staff from this course place
a greater emphasis upon the use of CD-ROM to support study, perhaps
due to more relevant literature being available via this medium.
 
</ul>

<p>

<ul>
<li>CD-ROM usage figures were low for Law students (38.8%).  In
comparison to the other categorised groups within this survey,
the law students showed an overall lower reliance upon electronic
resources.
</ul>



<p>
<h4>BIDS</h4>
<p>
Use of BIDS was very low across the whole sample (36.8%) apart
from the Pharmacy undergraduates from Case Studies A and B where
usage was very high (98.6%). This resource seems unlikely to attract
technology novices, as more information retrieval skills are required
to access any relevant information than are necessary to use the
Internet or CD-ROM.
<p>
<h4>Electronic Journals</h4>
<p>
37.5% of the sample population used electronic journals as an
information retrieval tool, a low number, although with the increase
in the number of journals which are published electronically,
this figure is likely to increase. 
<p>
<h5><i>Subject Analysis</i></h5>
<ul>
<li>A higher percentage of Business Administration students, from
Case Studies A and B, used this source (60%) suggesting greater
accessibility for these students.
</ul>

<p>

<p>
<h4>OPAC</h4>
<p>
Only 46% of respondents claimed to use OPACs, a figure which is
difficult to accept.  The author believes many of the respondents
were unaware that &quot;OPAC&quot; denotes On-line Public Access
Catalogue and had this have been made clearer, a larger number
of the students would have admitted to using it as a source.
<p>
In short, the popularity of the electronic resources specified
falls in the main to the Internet and CD-ROM.  As regards the
other resources, they are accessed by students in some subject
groups more than others, but this is not done by many of the sample
population.
<p>
<p align="center"><blockquote><blockquote><b>Question</b>:Question: <i>Please list three ways in which access to electronic resources has hindered your academic career.</i></blockquote></blockquote>
<p>
This question was included in the questionnaire distributed to
students at Case Studies A and B and the percentages have been
calculated from the total number of responses (171), rather than
the total number of possible responses (465).


<p align="center"><table border cellpadding="5" bgcolor="yellow">

</table>
</p>


<p>
Limited time and lack of effective information retrieval skills
seem to be the main barrier to using electronic resources.  With
effective information retrieval skills and a knowledge of the
most useful databases to search for a specific query, a smaller
amount of information is often retrieved, and the time spent searching
databases reduced.  However, with more effective search engines
and user-friendly interfaces, in-depth information retrieval skills
would not be as essential and therefore the time spent using the
source would also be reduced.
<p>
10.5% of the respondents stated that limited access to a computer
terminal hindered their academic career.  Despite a number of
computer centres opening for 24 hours, and booking systems to
ensure equality of access, students still appear to experience
difficulties locating a terminal.  This is likely to improve over
the next few years in response to one of the Dearing Report Recommendations
&quot;that by 2000/2001 higher education institutions should ensure
that all students have open access to a networked desktop computer
and expect that by 2005/2006 all students will be required to
have access to their own portable computer&quot; (<a href="#refs2">National Committee of Inquiry..., 1997</a>: 48).
<p>
A number of comments on the questionnaire distributed to students
at Case Study C highlighted concern as regards having limited
information retrieval skills.  This has led to a number of students
relying upon the printed material they are familiar with, instead
of trying to use the new resources.  The following comment epitomises
the majority:
<p>
<blockquote><blockquote><i>&quot;I much prefer to use printed resources because I am in
charge of using them.  I can turn the pages and use the indexes
properly and manually without worrying about wasting valuable
time&quot;</i>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote><blockquote><b>Question</b>:  <i>Please list three ways in which electronic
information resources have improved your academic career</i>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
Only Case Study A and B students were asked this question, and
percentages have been calculated using the total number of responses
(271), rather than the total number of possible responses (465).

<p align="center">
<table border cellpadding="5" bgcolor="yellow">
<caption align="bottom">Table 2: How respondents feel electronic resources have improved
their academic career.</caption>
<tr><th>Response</th><th>Percentage</th></tr>
<tr><td>Access to current up-to-date information</td><td align="center">9.9</td></tr>

</table>
</p>

<p>
22.1% of the respondents who answered stated faster access to
information as a benefit of using electronic resources, yet 16.4%
stated it was time consuming to use.  Similarly, while 25.1% of
respondents found access to a wider range of information an advantage,
10.5% found it a disadvantage.  This suggests students are, on
the whole, confused about the potential benefits of electronic
resources.
<p>
<h5><i>Subject Analysis</i></h5>
<ul>
<li>72.7% of respondents studying on the Marine Geography course
felt the main benefit of electronic resources to be access to
current up-to-date information, suggesting a need for this within
their subject.
</ul>

<p>
<blockquote><blockquote><b>Question</b>: <i>&quot;I tend to avoid using electronic sources
as I cannot effectively utilise the services offered&quot;</i>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p align="center"><img src="p54fig2.gif"></p>
<p>
The majority of respondents disagreed with this statement suggesting
a perceived ability on behalf of 70.3% of the respondents to effectively
utilise the services offered.  Although this suggests an emerging
student population equipped with very effective information retrieval
skills, it does not provide analysis of which electronic resources
the students use.  As a previous question highlighted, in the
main, the Internet and CD-ROMs are popular resources, so students
are likely to have responded to this question using a minimum
of electronic resources.  Conversely, students may feel the real
reason for avoiding using electronic resources to be due to a
lack of computer availability rather than an ability to utilise
the services.
<p>
One-quarter of the respondents agreed with the statement, a significant
percentage admitting to avoiding the use of electronic resources
because of a lack of relevant skills.  In light of the emerging
emphasis upon electronic resources within higher education, it
is vital that these students acquire relevant skills so they do
not end up 'left behind' in an ever prevalent information society.
<p>
<h5><i>Subject Analysis</i></h5>
<ul>
<li>Respondents from social studies expressed different responses
from the whole sample by expressing overwhelming support for the
statement.  This group also felt that using electronic resources
had not improved the quality of their work.
</ul>

<p>

<p>
<h4>End-user satisfaction</h4>
<p>
Respondents, in the main, perceived themselves to be confident
and able users of electronic resources.  Biddiscombe (<a href="#refs">Biddiscombe,
1996
</a>) discovered from his international survey of academic
library networked services, that 69% of respondents were generally
satisfied with results obtained from database searching.  However,
as mentioned previously, one must be aware that the views of the
students may not reflect the views of an information professional.
 Ankeny stated from a study undertaken on 600 untrained end-users,
&quot;in many cases high levels of reported end-user 'satisfaction'
with computerised services may not reflect true success rates&quot;
(<a href="#refs">Ankeny, 1991</a>: 356). This is an issue which poses some concern
for information professionals for as long as the student perceives
themselves to be happy with their search results, the need to
refine search terms, or use alternative sources may not emerge.
<p>

<blockquote><blockquote><b>Question</b>: <i>&quot;I have been unable to acquire any significant
information from the Internet&quot;</i>
</blockquote></blockquote>


<p align="center"><img src="p54fig3.gif"></p>

<p>
Nearly one-third of the respondents from Case Studies A and B
agreed with the statement.  More research is required to determine
whether this is due to a lack of information retrieval skills
on the part of the student, or the problems associated with the
lack of organisation of information on the Internet.  A number
of comments from the respondents confirms the latter view, as
many stated they would rather not use the Internet as it is too
slow, has ineffective search engines and is difficult to use.
Seemingly, if search engines were made more effective and information
was organised in an appropriate manner, greater satisfaction as
regards information retrieved might occur.
<p>
Conversely, students may indeed lack the relevant information
retrieval skills to use the Internet, hence resulting in find
nothing of any significance from that source.  One academic lecturer
interviewed by the IMPEL team had been working in Canada at the
time when Internet access became available to students and commented
that:
<p>

<blockquote><blockquote><i>&quot;the quality of the essays written by the students went
dramatically down, they didn't know how to handle it and they
didn't have the background knowledge to really evaluate the information
available on a certain Internet source&quot;</i>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
More positively, 60.3% of respondents felt they had acquired significant
information from the Internet, with no distinction between information
of an academic nature or information for extra-curricular interests.
<p>
<h5><i>Subject Analysis</i></h5>
<ul>
<li>Marine geography students expressed views which varied from
the whole sample population, with 100% of them disagreeing that
they had been unable to acquire any significant information from
the Internet, perhaps a reflection that these students have been
encouraged to use the Internet.
</ul>


<blockquote><blockquote><b>Question</b>: <i>Do you feel that the standard of your work
would suffer without electronic resources?</i>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p align="center"><img src="p54fig4.gif"></p>

<p>
This chart clearly highlights the growing importance of electronic
resources in higher education.  42% of respondents declared that
their work would suffer without the use of electronic resources,
although a similar number have yet to be convinced.  Although
one question presented to the respondent showed only 14% referred
more to electronic resources than printed resources, this question
highlights that many, although perhaps placing greater emphasis
upon printed material, also utilise electronic resources for academic
work.
<p>

<blockquote><blockquote><b>Question</b>: <i>How have you learned to use electronic resources?</i></blockquote></blockquote>

<p align="center"><table border cellpadding="5" bgcolor="yellow">

</p>


<p>
The table shows responses from students at Case Studies A and
B.  The most popular method of acquiring the necessary skills
to use electronic resources was via Trial and Error (78.7%) and
guidance from other students (78.7%).  More than half of the respondents
(54.2%) also received guidance from library staff, but it seems
most respondents approach the learning process as individuals
or with their peers.  Students from Case Study C were asked this
question in relation to specific electronic resources.  Responses
reflect those from Case Studies A and B, where the most popular
method for learning to use the resources was self taught and guidance
from other students.  68% of respondents used this method to use
the Internet, while 66% did for using CD-ROMs.  
<p>
With the number of students entering higher education increasing
and the number of staff not rising accordingly, the possibility
of ensuring students have acquired the correct skills if they
do not attend sessions or seek guidance is essentially very difficult
to monitor.
<p>
Long experience of user education programmes has shown that teaching
information retrieval skills to students should be embedded into
the curriculum and done at a time when the user can understand
its appropriateness.  This training should also be adapted to
the varying abilities of the users which, as this survey has demonstrated,
is vast.  If students are aware that the skills required for using
electronic resources are not insular, and indeed provide them
with valuable transferable lifelong skills, skills which employers
will be looking for, they may be more likely to learn how to use
them.
<p>
Encouragement via academic staff can only serve to promote the
usefulness of electronic resources to students.  As one academic
member of staff interviewed by the IMPEL team commented, many
students, when looking for information:
<p>
<blockquote><blockquote><i>&quot; think what's on the reading list, I'm following the
course&quot;</i>
</blockquote></blockquote>

<p>
Therefore, if academic staff were to promote electronic resources,
with references for students to locate, this may increase the
number of students acquiring the necessary information retrieval
skills.  Clearly this depends upon academic staff having the ability
to do this.  IMPEL data suggested that many academic staff seem
reluctant to use electronic sources, one of the main reasons for
this being that they are unaware of what is available to them
and what the services are capable of doing.  Indeed, only 25.8%
of students from Case Studies A and B admitted to having acquired
the skills to use electronic resources via guidance offered from
lecturers.  This may provide an explanation for the difference
in attitudes of students in different subject groups, as if academic
staff, confident and in favour of electronic resources are concentrated
 into a small number of departments, by promoting the advantages
of using technology to their students, a difference across the
student population as regards information retrieval skills will
emerge.  If students are not encouraged to use electronic resources
by their tutors, and information skills training occurs outside
of the curriculum, students will be less likely to make use of
electronic resources for academic purposes.
<p>
<h2><font color="navy">Conclusion</font></h2>
<p>
The findings of this small sample population suggest many respondents
do use some electronic resources and are aware of their benefits,
but the majority still like to use printed material to complement
this technology.
<ul>
<li>96.4% of respondents acknowledged an awareness of access to
a networked computer via university, although many stated computer
availability deterred them from using the resources.
<li>the most popular electronic resources were the Internet and
CD-ROMs.  Other resources were accessed by some subject groups
more than others, but this was not done by many of the sample
population.
<li>limited time and lack of effective information retrieval skills
form the main barriers to using electronic resources.  Conversely,
faster access to information was noted as a main advantage of
electronic resources.  
<li>70.3% of respondents perceived themselves able to effectively
utilise the services offered.
<li>60.3% of respondents felt they could acquire significant information
from the Internet.
<li>most students acquired the skills necessary to exploit the
electronic resources via trial and error or through guidance from
other students, raising the question of the effectiveness of these
skills.
<li>results were different dependent upon subject studied for
most of the questions, suggesting three things which may effect
how the respondents feel:


<ul>
<li>the use of technology in the degree course
<li>relevant information available electronically
<li>the effectiveness of academic staff in promoting these new services
</ul>
<li>The results of the whole sample did not differ across 
institutions. 
</ul>


<p>
<h3><font color="teal">Recommendations</font></h3>
<p>
Results from this study are encouraging and as with previous studies
undertaken highlight many students who do use these electronic
resources and are confident in doing so.  However, it is also
apparent that a large number of students from the sample population
are leaving University without the necessary transferable skills
to cope in an information based society.  Further research is
necessary to show how best to encourage students to make effective
use of the electronic sources that are available.  Views of LIS
staff interviewed in the IMPEL project together with these findings
from students suggest the following approaches may support student
use:
<ul>
<li>ensure there are sufficient networked computers available
for students, especially at peak times
<li>information retrieval skills training to be embedded in the
curriculum, undertaken at an appropriate time and supported by
academic staff.  Academic staff must be aware of the services
which are most beneficial to their course and therefore their
students
<li>ensure students studying subjects without an emphasis upon
technology receive sufficient information retrieval skills training
so are not prejudiced against due to subject chosen
<li>promotion of on-screen help, printed guides and training for
the less popular electronic resources, to encourage students to
see the potential of them
<li>ensure information skills training is pitched at a level which
is appropriate to the individual needs of the student.

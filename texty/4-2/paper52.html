In order to identify a common currency for a range of clinical activities that are inherently variable, price tariffs have been drawn up on the basis of 'episodes of care' within specialties. Healthcare Resource Groups (HRGs) were designed to meet the need for a common information currency. However, they were designed for acute care. The study on which this paper is based aims to examine their applicability to chronic care in a cancer specialist unit. The data were drawn from the patient information system within a major cancer unit. The focus of the investigation is encapsulated in the following questions: a) Do HRGs really work as a grouping and costing methodology? b) How relevant are HRG classifications for long-term patient care? The investigation demonstrated that not all HRGs are iso-resource within this environment.

<h2>Role of Healthcare Resource Groups </h2>

<p>In order to establish a manageable, equable and equitable currency,
the NHS Executive has attempted to establish a means of identifying
episodes within clinically homogeneous, isoresource groups. Since
1992 it has been promoting the use of such categories for inpatient
and daycase episodes, under the title of Healthcare Resource Groups
(HRG). The role of these was made clear in NHSE statements (<a href="#refs">NHSE,
1994</a>):</p>

<p>&quot;HRGs are a nationally recognised method of classifying casemix
by categorising patients into a manageable number of groups which
are:</p>

<ul>
<li>clinically similar (homogeneous);</li>
<li>expected to consume similar amounts of resource (iso-resource);</li>
<li>used as a &quot;language&quot; between clinicians and managers&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>The methods employed to develop HRGs have also been set out and
indicate the reliance on clinical coding standards (<a href="#refs">NHSE, 1993</a>):</p>

<p>
&quot;HRGs use ICD diagnostic codes and OPCS procedure codes as
the basis of grouping, together with information on age and discharge
status. Records can be grouped using only the Minimum Contract
Dataset information which is collected on all acute inpatient
and daycase episodes&quot;.</p>
<p>
As such, HRGs are intended to offer a workable solution to the need for more meaningful information. They are at an intermediate level of statistical analysis coming between specialty, which contains insufficient detail about patient based workload, and diagnosis, with so much detail that the global view becomes lost. This is shown as follows:</p>

<p>A comparative overview is offered by the NHS Executive's Information
Management Group in documentation relating to the classifications
(<a href="#refs">NHSE IMG, 1994</a>).</p>

<h2>The study: the use of HRGs in cancer care </h2>

<p>The research project forming the basis of this paper is a study
of the application of HRGs in contracting for cancer services.
This is an evaluation of their suitability as groupings within
administrative information systems in respect of purchasers' requirements
and patients' needs. The focus of the investigation is encapsulated
in the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do HRGs really work as a grouping and costing methodology?</li>
<li>How relevant are HRG classifications for long-term patient
care?</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions arose from the managerial need to match episode
based costing of healthcare with the requirements of cancer treatment.
The concept of a hospital episode as a commercial commodity and
information entity may be appropriate for many acute medical conditions,
but chronic diseases require long term care. The management of
cancer patients involves three different treatment modalities:
surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, alone or in combination.
The duration of active treatment is variable. It can span over
many years, during which time the patient can have several admissions
to hospital; or may be treated entirely on an outpatient basis.
The investigation of HRGs and their relevance to cancer care was
initiated as a result of the immediate paradox between the treatment
of chronic disease and the costing of the care. Leading on from
initial findings, it explores the ways in which contract information
can be enhanced, either as an alternative to, or in combination
with, HRGs.</p>

<p>Collection of data for the study has taken place within a major
specialist cancer unit and examines the relevance of HRG information
for a group of cancer patients within the gynaecology specialty.
This focus was the result of there being no current HRGs for oncology,
so gynaecology was chosen as an instance of a grouped clinical
activity involved in cancer diagnosis and treatment. 1997/8 information
from the National Casemix Office indicates that this will continue
for the time being. The methodology involved a retrospective analysis
of patient data to obtain information about the care episodes
that comprise individual treatments for specific cancer diagnoses.
Costed patient activity data were classified within HRGs and tested
to ascertain the homogeneity of the groupings - to see whether
they are &quot;iso-resource&quot;. The data were then analysed
further, within diagnostic categories, to try and establish whether
any pattern, of treatments and costs, could be discerned from
the activity records.</p>

<h3>Characteristics of the study </h3>

<p>The perceived anomalies in treatment of chronic disease and in
the costing of the care, provided the background to a problem
area that had other irregular characteristics. The reliance of
HRG based costing formulae on episodes of care, implied that these
episodes were commonly understood and interpreted. A survey of
1994/95 price tariffs for extra-contractual referrals (ECRs) issued
by twenty different Trusts showed that charges were based on episodes
of care, classified as FCEs (finished consultant episodes). These
were either within specialties, which in these instances might
include paediatrics, or for specific treatments eg. bone marrow
transplants. Some hospitals had additional tariffs for diagnostic
procedures, such as X-rays and blood tests. These episodes of
care are inpatient stays, daycase admissions and outpatient attendance.
Such standard measures give the impression of similarity, but
these classifications do not always imply homogeneous services.
Tariffs, for example, could be qualified by making additional
charges for inpatient stays exceeding 28 days, patient transport
costs, prostheses or certain high-cost drugs. The unit of an FCE
may not necessarily be the whole period of an admission, as it
refers to the part of an inpatient stay spent under the care of
an individual consultant - whose definition is not always interpreted
in a consistent manner. Even where there may be consistency in
relating admissions to consultants, the admissions themselves
may vary in the extent to which they relate to an FCE (<a href="#refs">Clarke
&amp; McKee, 1992</a>). Different hospitals have different methods
of coding this activity for contracting purposes; some count each
patient <i>visit</i> for chemotherapy or radiotherapy as a daycase
FCE while another counts a <i>course</i> of chemotherapy or radiotherapy
as an outpatient FCE (<a href="#refs">Gandy, 1996</a>)</p>
<p>
Finally, there may be differences in the classifications themselves.
A patient suffering from gynaecological cancer could be categorised
within one of several specialties: general surgery, medical oncology,
radiotherapy or gynaecology - depending on their treatment and
the hospital's method of assigning diagnoses, or treatments, to
clinical specialties. Consistency of management information is
clearly an issue in this context.</p>

<h3>Episode cost analysis </h3>

<p>
The classification of Gynaecology HRGs is based primarily on operating
procedures, although they are split into two groups: surgical
and medical. The information that determines the classification
of admission and daycase episodes by HRG is diagnosis, procedure
and patient age. For ordinary admission episodes the length of
stay is also relevant: data is &quot;trimmed&quot; to exclude
&quot;outliers&quot; - episodes of abnormally long duration. The
NCMO guidelines include statistical information on average lengths
of stay, and the &quot;trim point&quot;, for each HRG (<a href="#refs">NCMO, 1994</a>).</p>
<p>
In order to establish the existence of relationships between HRGs
and costs, a cost analysis of eight sets of HRGs used in this
study is given in the following table. These were the datasets
for which the information system provided a significant number
of records.</p>

<ul>
<li>Two surgical HRGs M04 and M07 - ordinary admission episodes (within &quot;normal&quot; length-of-stay limits)</li>
<li>Four medical HRGs M27, M28, M29 and M30 - ordinary admission episodes (within &quot;normal&quot; length-of-stay limits)</li>
<li>One medical HRG M29 - ordinary admission episodes (outliers) </li>
<li>One medical HRG M29 - daycase episodes</li>
</ul>

</table>
               
<p>It should be noted that the prices for this exercise are estimates
as a tool for the research. They are <i>comparative</i> rather
than absolute and have no bearing on any actual costs within a
particular cancer unit.</p>

<p>The data records relating to these eight HRGs were then studied
to try to arrive at an answer to the question &quot;do HRGs work,
as a costing methodology?&quot;. The costed episodes within each
HRG were analysed to see whether:</p>

<ul>
<li>- each group was homogeneous, i.e. similar in terms of cost (iso-resource);</li>
<li>- individual groups could be separately identified (by their cost ranges or mean values);</li>
<li>- costs are related to HRG categories, i.e. to determine whether a HRG category might be a reasonably accurate predictor of the likely cost of an episode.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the table we can see that two pairs of HRGs for trimmed ordinary
admissions appear to be very similar:</p>


<ul>
<li>M04 Minor procedures uterus/adnexae &amp; M07 Intermediate procedures cervix/uterus
<li>M28 Carcinoma of ovary aged &gt; 69 or with complications &amp; M29 Carcinoma of ovary aged &lt; 70 without complications
</ul>

<p>
and that M04/M07, M28/M29 and M31 appear to be discrete sets,
distinguishable by their different median values while at the
same time having comparable inter-quartile ranges.</p>
<p>
The table also highlights the wide ranges between the upper and
lower quartiles for M30 (other gynaecological malignancy aged
&gt; 64 or with complications), trimmed ordinary admissions and
M29 outliers (those whose admission lasted longer than six nights)
- and the considerable contrast between the cheapest (M29 daycases)
and most expensive (M29 outliers) groups.</p>
<p>
The 937 data records were analysed using Minitab software. Parametric
tests such as analysis of variance and T-Tests (to decide whether
there is a significant difference between the mean costs of two
populations) assume a normal distribution. Had the data been plotted
on a graph, with cost values (grouped into cost bands) along the
x axis and number of episodes in each cost band on the y axis,
this would have shown a non-normal distribution, that is, positively
skewed. For this reason it was more appropriate to use non-parametric
tests on the data sets.</p>

<h4>Kruskal-Wallis test </h4>

<p>The purpose of this test was to establish whether or not each
set of HRG data records are different from each other. HRGs are
designed to be homogeneous in respect of their clinical classifications,
but unless there is also some difference in terms of cost then
the point of having so many different groupings within the same
specialty would be questionable.</p>

<p>The results of the Kruskal-Wallis test are reproduced in the following table:</p>

<p>The &quot;Z value&quot; is the distance from the mean rank of
the whole data set (937 records) in comparison with the mean rank
of each group within it. The null hypothesis, that there is little
difference between each set, would yield a Z value of zero. The
result shows that all values except M28 are significantly different
from the mean rank (that is, having a Z value greater than two
or less than minus two). This may not be surprising since each
of the sets excludes the outliers and the daycases, the longer
than average stays and the shortest stays - but they have been
included in the test as separate groups. To see just how much
the results are affected by these two groups the test was repeated
- excluding the outliers and daycases:</p>

<h4>Mann-Whitney test </h4>

<p>This test compares the medians of two populations, the null hypothesis being that they have distributions which are identical in all respects. For this test four pairs of HRGs were selected, on the
basis that they have logical links:</p>

</table>

<p>The results of these tests confirmed the original indications
from the Kruskal-Wallis test. There was no significant difference
between the two surgical groups M04 and M07. And although there
was no difference between the two groups with Ca. ovary, M28 and
M29, there was a very clear difference between the trimmed M29
episodes and the outliers. Also the groups of patients with &quot;other
gynaecological malignancies&quot;, M30 and M31, were found to
differ.</p>

<h3>Data analysis</h3>

<p>Of the data sets analysed in this study, some results were much
as anticipated while some of the findings were somewhat ambiguous.
Any conclusions drawn from the results of the investigations are
limited, because of the omission of radiotherapy and chemotherapy
expenditure in calculating the episode costs of the medical HRGs.</p>

<p>Two pairs of groups appeared to be similar in terms of cost: M04
and M07, M28 and M29, despite the differences in their trim points.
Although group M04 comprises minor surgical procedures while M07
is a group of intermediate procedures, the average duration of
the admissions were very similar and there was no significant
difference between their episode costs. For M04 the trim point
is 3 nights, 6 nights for M07. The records show that 4 nights
was the maximum duration for the 22 patients whose admission coded
to M07. Both groups had a very similar average length of stay
- in fact M04 were slightly longer with an average of 2.19 nights
while M07 averaged 2.05 nights.</p>

<p>Comparing groups M28 and M29 shows the same picture: they are
not significantly different. Although it would seem that the older
patients are expected to tend to stay longer (the trim point for
M28 is 23 nights, but it is only 6 nights for the younger patients,
M29), in fact the average duration for both groups was virtually
the same: 1.77 nights for M28 and 1.76 nights for M29. For the
sample patients, then, it seems reasonable to assume that the
patients' ages did not influence their lengths of stay and, it
follows, the median cost of these episodes.</p>

<p>Therefore, for this study group, it appears that the two pairs
of groups that looked similar really do seem to be comparable
in terms of both cost and duration of admission. What is surprising
then is that these HRGs (M04/M07 and M28/M29) are separate classifications.
This would seem to imply that there <i>ought</i> to have been
differences in these groups, in their lengths of stay (and episode
costs).</p>

<p>The largest group in the dataset was the trimmed M29 episodes,
that is, patients aged below 70 with carcinoma of ovary, excluding
outliers. There were 380 of these events. The episodes related
to 145 patients, all but one of whom had an ICD9 code of 183.0
(malignant neoplasm ovary), the single exception having a diagnosis
of metastatic adenocarcinoma of ovary, ICD9 code 198.6.</p>
<p>
For ovarian cancer the standard treatment, for patients with operable
disease, is total hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy
- surgical episodes which would have derived a HRG code of M11
&quot;Major procedures of uterus/adnexae&quot;. Where the disease
is more advanced, but still localised to the abdominopelvic cavity,
surgery is followed by platinum based chemotherapy (Neal &amp;
Hoskin, 1994). In patients whose disease is beyond all hope of
cure, radiotherapy may be given for symptom palliation. Eight
of the patients in the study group received radiotherapy, four
of these women were given no other form of treatment at the unit.</p>
<p>
Excluding the cost of drugs and radiotherapy, all the medical
episodes that were coded to HRG M29 have a median cost of &#163;505
and average cost of &#163;644. The cost at the upper quartile
was &#163;834, &#163;329 (65%) more than the median and &#163;190
(30%) more than the mean. The cost of the most expensive episode
in this group was &#163;2,925 which is almost six times greater
than the median value. Even this group, with all its similarities
in diagnoses and narrow range of admission durations (maximum
duration of stay being six nights), had quite widely varying episode
costs. It seems reasonable to assume that if treatment costs had
been included in the episode prices this additional cost variable
would have led to even more differences in price.</p>
<p>
For the same group of patients, HRG M29, there was a clear difference
between the trimmed admission episodes and the outliers. We know
that the episode costs are largely determined by the duration
of the admission, particularly for the medical groups where treatment
costs are excluded from the data. So it was no surprise to find
that the outliers, who all stayed in excess of six nights, were
found to have a much higher median value (i.e. were dearer) than
the trimmed data: patients who stayed a maximum of six nights.</p>
<p>
For the M29 outliers the minimum length of stay was seven nights
and there was no maximum set (in fact the average number of beddays
was 15, the longest duration was for a patient who stayed 44 nights).
This was the dearest group in the study, with the greatest inter-quartile
range.</p>
<p>
As anticipated, M29 daycases were clearly much cheaper than other
groups. The evidence for this is provided by the table and the
Kruskal-Wallis test. This group had the smallest inter-quartile
range, which was doubtless due to the parity in lengths of stay:
all patients were admitted and discharged on the same day.</p>
<p>
As has been stated, both the groups with carcinoma of ovary, M28
and M29, were not significantly different, however it appears
that age <i>could</i> affect episode costs for &quot;other gynaecological
malignancies&quot;: these two groups, M30 and M31, were found
to be different. This is not unexpected, considering the differences
in trim points - although it might potentially have been caused
by differences in casemix.</p>
<p>
Of the 174 episodes in M31, 159 (91%) were for Ca. cervix. The
episodes in this group had a median cost of &#163;791, but the
trim point is only 13 nights and the average length of stay was
3 nights.</p>
<p>
The median cost of M30 episodes, with a trim point of 40 nights,
was &#163;1,508. The average length of stay for the M30 group
was, in fact, 10 nights with durations of admission ranging between
1 night and 37 nights. The variation in lengths of stay also explains
the large disparity between the lower and upper quartiles for
the episode costs of this group. M30 comprised 44 episodes, of
which 11 were for patients with cancer of the vulva and had an
average duration of 17 nights. 31 episodes related to Ca. cervix,
but even they had, on average, a longer stay than the women in
the younger age group with the same diagnosis: 8 nights.</p>

<h3>Discussion of findings</h3>

<p>
Statistical measures of correlation applied to the historical
data provide some guidance in attempting to answer the two questions
relating to the value and relevance of HRGs. As management information
tools, they need to offer sufficient uniformity as a currency
to act as identifiable units. In addressing the original questions
behind the study, the findings indicate the following.</p>
<p>
<i>Do HRGs really &quot;work&quot; - as a grouping and costing
methodology?</i> </p>
<p>
The investigation demonstrated that not all HRGs are iso-resource.
The findings from the data analysis are echoed by the NHSE's own
evaluation (<a href="#refs">NHSE, 1995</a>). This does not negate advantages in their
use. In some cases HRGs were found to be isoresource by one measure.
An example of this is the correlation between cost and length
of stay. An additional analysis took place of the costs of ordinary
admissions plotted against their beddays. The correlation found
between these two variables, 0.95 in the data set, confirms their
close relationship, even though the surgical HRGs included treatment
costs while the medical HRGs did not. Consequently, the longer
the duration of the admission the greater the cost of the episode.</p>
<p>
<i>How relevant are HRG classifications for long-term patient
care?</i> </p>
<p>
This cannot be answered fully just yet. The gynaecology HRGs analysed
in this study would be adequate for surgical episodes, but this
may only reflect a single stage of the overall treatment strategy.
In respect of medical treatments for cancer patients HRGs give
no clinical information and, in this study, no indication of the
cost of the treatment element. HRGs devised specially for oncology
would be designed to overcome these failings. Current development
of Health Benefit Groups (HBGs) may hold the answer through better
understanding of outcomes and the actual benefits of healthcare.
These are an example of various techniques for measuring casemix
that are currently being researched, such as Patient Management
Categories, Resource Utilisation Groups and HBGs themselves. They
are intended to enable a better understanding of outcomes, and
to reflect the benefits of care. HBGs will &quot;provide an invaluable
tool for strategic commissioning and contracting for health benefit,
as well as enhancing the use of HRGs by linking health need to
costed patient care&quot; (<a href="#refs">NCMO, 1995</a>). HBGs will be additionally
valuable as information tools through their mapping to ICD codes
and HRGs (<a href="#refs">NCMO, 1996a</a>).</p>
<p>
HBGs should be particularly appropriate in the cancer setting.
While HRGs are primarily concerned with treatments and take no
account of the severity of a patient's illness, HBGs are based
on the condition and the level of severity within that condition,
with the aim of determining the appropriate treatment and predicting
the likely outcome. &quot;HBGs are linked with appropriate HRGs
in a matrix to enable the resource requirements of a population
to be measured and the likely benefits identified&quot; (<a href="#refs">NCMO,
1996b</a>). This system should increase the clinical relevance of
contract management information. Even if it does not entirely
succeed it still offers considerable benefits, particularly to
purchasers. It promises a combination of qualitative information,
the clinical details, with the quantitative information necessary
for contract management. HBGs provide information on resources
linked to people rather than treatments. They should enable <i>prediction</i>
of treatment and link this to outcomes. This capability is not
a feature of HRGs although version 3 of the groupings, released
in September 1997 may, with further analysis, prove more effective
(<a href="#refs">NCMO, 1997</a>).</p>

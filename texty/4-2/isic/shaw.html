<h2>Introduction</h2>
The original title for the PhD research was broad and read as:  <em>The Use of the 
Internet by Humanities Academics</em>. This was narrowed slightly by the selection 
of the English and History disciplines for comparisons amongst the humanities 
overall. In the time available for the research (three years funded), it would not have 
been feasible to consider investigating more than two groups of humanities academics. 
Generally it is thought that the humanities can be viewed as either traditional or 
modern in interpretation. The traditional subject areas include language, literature, 
linguistics, philosophy, religion, music, history, archaeology and the arts. The more 
modern areas would be performing, creative and visual arts, media studies and 
communication studies (<a href="#ref2">Kirkham, 1989</a>). It is notoriously difficult to say what those 
disciplines have in common, but they share at least the task of connecting the past and 
present as they are manifested in the works and acts of men (<a href="#ref2">Roush, 1969</a>).  Many 
authors prefer to be general in their usage of the term humanities, others specific, 
referring to historians alone. The phrase ‘humanistic scholar’ is often used instead of 
‘humanities scholar’. Likewise, the humanities has been described as a group of study 
as opposed to fields of study. It can only be concluded that there is a lack of consensus 
being reached within the humanities as to what the term humanities means.<p>

Since January 1998, there has been a review and modification of the title towards 
English Literature, which is part of the traditional humanities. It now reads as: 
<em>The Use of the Internet by English Academics</em>.  According to Gould 
(<a href="#ref1">1993</a>) literary scholarship is increasingly interdisciplinary with more than ever, its 
sources overlapping with those of other disciplines. Mullings <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ref2">1996</a>) 
advocates that the computer has already become a comfortable object for almost all 
literary scholars in areas of communication and production of typescript, and it is 
rapidly becoming accepted as a tool of literary enquiry also. Ciolek (<a href="#ref1">1998</a>) concludes 
in a Scholarly <em>Internet</em> Survey that the three most popular professional 
uses of the <em>Internet</em> revolve around sending and receiving electronic mail 
(individual and list-mediated), and reading on-line news. This is open to debate as this 
survey was distributed to subscribers of English language electronic mailing lists 
specialising in Asian and Pacific studies.


<h2>Context</h2>
During this decade we have witnessed a proliferation of information technologies 
which are transporting us into the new millennium and beyond. One example is the 
Internet and the World Wide Web. The Internet could not have been made possible 
without the advent of the personal computer in the 1970s. It is evident that the library 
is no longer the only building where access may be gained to a wealth of stored 
information. Increasingly, it is the Internet, which is operational 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week (subject to connections and time delays), that is the preferred option, 
being available via the personal computer which is more often than not situated in the 
academic’s office, or increasingly at home.<p>

What does the Internet have to offer? Not only are there web sites which contain 
hypertext-links all over the world, but there are also discussion groups and mailing 
lists, including electronic mail that can enable the academic to converse electronically 
within minutes about a query. File Transfer Protocol (ftp) allows the rapid transfer of 
documents from one file to another almost instantaneously. The first electronic project 
dates back to 1948 when Father Busa started to prepare electronic texts of St Thomas 
Aquinas for his monumental Index Thomisticus (<a href="#ref1">Hockey, 1997</a>). It was 1973 before 
the first volume was made available (<a href="#ref1">Deegan, 1995</a>). As a result of information 
becoming available electronically, academics are having to become computer literate 
to enable them to handle this tool effectively for use in their research.  Electronic texts 
on-line are a valuable resource for the academic who can scan pages rapidly and 
download chapters of books for analysis. This is especially true for the English 
academic who can now access a whole range of primary sources, such as novels, 
poetry and literary essays that have exceeded their copyright date, back runs of critical 
journals and current scholarly journals in electronic form. The Oxford Text 
Archive, which is one of the oldest and best-known electronic centres in the world,
works closely with members of the Arts and Humanities academic community to collect,
catalogue, and preserve high-quality texts for research and teaching.


<h2>The proposed work plan</h2>
 Key areas of focus are :
<ul>
  <li>Information Needs
  <li>Information Seeking Behaviour
  <li>Information Uses of English Academics
</ul>
These areas of focus will be investigated from two angles: the teaching and research 
aspects of the literary scholar’s daily working life. Whilst previous studies will be a 
guide to this area, one major aspect to be covered here will be how information on the 
Internet is interacted with by the English Academics themselves. The emphasis will 
also be particularly on the <em>USE</em> of the Internet and the electronic 
environment.<p>

The above areas of focus raise the following (sample) questions :

<ul>
  <li>How do they carry out their literature searches for their research?
  <li>Is their information need satisfied by the use of the Internet?
  <li>Are English academics aware of the types of information that are available to 
them electronically?
  <li>Do they use them for research/teaching?
  <li>How or why do they use these sources?
  <li>What problems do they face in using these sources?
  <li>What are the problems associated with using these sources, e.g. copyright, 
access, knowledge about what is on offer, technological problems?
  <li>Have English academics grasped the necessary information-handling skills in 
order to use the electronic sources that are available on the Internet?
</ul>
In the first instance it was essential that a literature survey (approximately six months) 
was carried out. This helped to determine which methodologies would be most 
suitable for use with this target group, as well as identifying previously recorded 
studies of information use in the area of the humanities. The choice of methodologies 
(e.g. focus groups, questionnaires, observation and interviews) will only reveal 
themselves once personal contact with academics has taken place, although the
approach will be qualitative as opposed to quantitative. Time management 
must feature highly throughout the duration of this research to gain the maximum 
usage of resources and results. The intention is to carry out a pilot study in the 
University of Wales, Aberystwyth (UWA) first to gauge the response and eliminate 
those academics who are unable to assist in this research from the outset, before 
extending the study to other colleges of the University of Wales.<p>

After analysis of these results it may be possible to make suggestions as to how 
English Academics can be more productive in their work (teaching and research) 
through the <em>USE</em> of the Internet. Two-way communication is vital in this 
research, otherwise the outcome will be a biased point of view. The nineties scholar 
after all, has varying information needs, uses and seeking behaviour now, especially 
since electronic environments became accessible in their own workplace.<p>

A number of studies have taken place in the 1980s and early 1990s, but these relate to 
the humanities discipline, and not necessarily to those in the English discipline or to 
the Internet, for example; (<a href="#ref1">Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1993</a>; <a href="#ref1">Fulton, 1991</a>; <a href="#ref1">Gould, 1988</a>; <a href="#ref2">Katzen, 1986</a>; <a href="#ref2">Stieg, 1981</a>; 
<a href="#ref2">Stone, 1982</a>; <a href="#ref3">Watson-Boone, 1994</a>; <a href="#ref3">Wilson & Walsh, 1996</a>). According to most estimates, 
more than one million people will ‘Net’work each day from over two million host 
computers.  In 1995, universities in more than 40 countries provided full Internet 
participation. At that time, many had access only to the email function, but if the rate 
of growth in that year continued, it was projected that there could be 300 million users 
by 1999, 750 million by 2000, and 1.5 billion by 2001 (<a href="#ref1">Bane &amp Milheim, 1995</a>).


<h2>Progress to date </h2>
<h3>Year One</h3>
The initial PhD research began in October 1997 with a literature survey covering a 
variety of formats; for example; <em>Computers &amp Humanities; Computers &amp 
Texts</em> printed journals, electronic journals, the world wide web, and the Library
and Information Science Abstracts on CD-ROM, dealing with my chosen discipline. 
The literature search looked at the information seeking habits and information needs of
the humanities scholar. Before the New Year a general overview of the humanities was 
produced, focusing on the areas of History and English (including Uniform Resource 
Locators references). This overview revealed that English academics are the lesser 
known academics in terms of their research and teaching habits in an electronic 
context (except for those situated in America where technology has moved on at a 
faster pace). <p>

Scholars in the humanities, like researchers in other subjects, make use of 
computers for word processing, for cataloguing the books in their departmental 
libraries, and also for desk-top publishing (<a href="#ref2">Kenny, 1991</a>). The tried and tested 
print formats in the physical library are often the preferred option to the electronic 
scene. More often than not, the necessary information handling skills have not been 
acquired by the academic of the English discipline to use the hardware and software to 
access the Internet. The Internet does require a different approach for obtaining 
information, articles, documents and carrying out a discussion in electronic format. 
For the past three years, Netskills Workshops have taken place across the country, for 
example, <em>Using the Internet for teaching and learning</em> (Cardiff, July 
7<sup>th</sup> 1998) introduced and explored some of the tools and techniques for
teaching using the Internet. <p>

During the spring months a second overview was compiled which concentrated solely 
on the varying aspects of English Literature. Unlike the previous overview, this one  
endeavoured to find out how the English Academic works in the working environment.
Although not comprehensive in nature, a list of approximately 100 web sites was constructed
to highlight the availability of sites dedicated to English Literature for the academic.
Many academics are concerned with typology i.e. they study genre, period or a theme or
specific named authors in depth; occasionally they might interact with more than one of
these typologies. The use of the web can enhance the ability of research that an academic
is required to undertake during their working life. Dedicated sites to authors such as the
Thomas Hardy, Jane Austen and Shakespeare for example, offer the English academic with the
opportunity of locating hypertext editions of novels, works and biographical,
bibliographic and critical material. Academics can also be directly involved with inputting 
information into an online database such as <em>The Reading Experience Database 1450-1914</em> (RED)
which is co-ordinated by the Open University. <p>

Similarly, teaching can be carried out in multi-media format with a large class of 
students quite effectively. Wack (<a href="#ref3">1993</a>) from the English Department of the Washington
State University has already taught a course on Chaucer in 2001, nicknamed 'Electronic
Chaucer'. From the remarks made in the symposium, it would appear that electronic sources
used solved her pedagogical problems. Similarly, Skilton (<a href="#ref2">1998</a>) from Cardiff
University devised a comprehensive electronic module entitled 'Literature and the City: 
London in the Nineteenth Century' for his English students.<p>

It is invaluable to know how these academics study their subject within the English 
discipline, to what depth, and which sources are of most value to them. In this way it 
can be assumed that a certain academic uses a specific type of electronic resource to 
suit their information use, thereby building up a picture of the English Department as 
a whole. However, three quarters of  Internet hosts and the majority of its users are in 
the US (<a href="#ref1">Barrett, 1996</a>), so this can apply a limiting factor to British counterparts. 

<h2>Summary</h2>

Today’s Internet is a result of the Department of Defense’s ARPAnet which 
began in 1969 to enable researchers to share major hardware and software 
resources located at remote computer centers. As with all technologies, there 
are the inevitable advantages and disadvantages. However, the speed at which 
information can be accessed and downloaded or printed (subject to 
connections and time zones) is phenomenal. A wealth of information awaits 
the academic in the English discipline on the continually evolving web which 
was developed at CERN in Geneva in 1994 (<a href="#ref2">Rockwell, 1997</a>). English Academics need
to be given the opportunity to embrace the electronic sources that are available for
use on the Internet, and receive training if information handling skills are not present.<p>

The research to date has been hampered by the requirement of funding bodies 
for first year PhD students to undertake a Postgraduate Training Course. This 
has taken up a considerable proportion of time during the first year, and it is to 
be hoped that the effort expended will eventually pay off.

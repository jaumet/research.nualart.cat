<h2>Introduction</h2>

<P>The academic community is a stratified social structure built on
competition 
  and a need to be acknowledged. In this environment men and women do not
  have the same opportunities and one manifestation is that women have
  difficulties in gaining access to social networks. This is likely to
  affect women's access to information, particularly information otherwise
  difficult to get, since that is usually available through informal
  personal contacts. Information exchange is fundamental for researchers
  and the foundation for their competence and authorisation. By being
  acknowledged by others the researcher and his/her research are given a
  value. The researcher can thus be seen as part of a social system. In
  this system information is needed for problem solving as well as
  advancement and both the amount and type of information available affect
  the researchers' participation and position in the system. Therefore,
  when studying how men and women find for them relevant information, it is
  interesting to take into consideration differences in access to
  information. If women have less or different opportunities to gather
  needed information, how will their information behaviour be affected? In
  addition, attention may be given to new information technology with new
  ways of getting into contact with people. There could be a potential for
  improved means of communication, beyond established structures.</P>

<P>The purpose of the thesis is to study the information behaviour of male
and 
  female post-graduate students from a gender perspective, with special
  focus on informal contacts and the importance of new information
  technology. This is done by a study of post-doctoral students in two
  academic settings. The goal is to gain a better understanding of the
  importance of information from different kinds of personal contacts for
  the research carrer and the role of information technology in the
  creation of such contacts. Information behaviour is regarded as the
  interplay between information needs, access to and use of information and
  the effects of information use (<a href="#ref">H&ouml;glund &amp; Persson, 1985</a>). These
  four aspects are treated as problem areas to which research questions are
  related. The behaviour is to a large extent affected and formed by a
  social context in which various demands, expectations and ideas affect
  people's ways and possibilities to act. Doctoral students are by means of
  their education, socialised into a social context in which information is
  necessary both for problem-solving and advancement and can thus be seen
  as an intellectual and social capital. The processes in which these
  capitals are acquired and their influence on the students' research
  careers are important to understand. Research on women and the academic
  community with descriptions of structural conditions will be used for an
  understanding of the students' milieu.</P>


<h2>Problem areas and hypotheses</h2>

<P>The need for information is governed not only by cognitive reasons;
equally 
  important are affective and physiological ones (<a href="#ref">Wilson, 1981</a>). The
  doctoral students' needs are responsive to personal needs and shaped in a
  social process where competition is central and in which information is
  needed in order to understand prevailing norms within the subject field.
  For example what subjects are appropriate, which scholars that are
  central to the field etc. Depending on what a student does and wish to
  accomplish, different kinds of information are sought from various
  sources. At the beginning of their post-graduate studies students may
  need information to understand the structure of the subject and the local
  environment, while later they may need to be familiar with international
  structures and actors related to their own research. This includes
  information about ways to financing, contacts and distribution of
  research material. For an understanding of the reasons for wanting
  information one must therefore look to the situations of the students;
  what they are doing, their expectations, future plans, financing etc. and
  what they need in order to handle their situations as post-graduate
  students.</P>

<P>A person's access to information affects how various needs can be
satisfied. 
  The sources from where information is available are often divided into
  formal and informal, giving access to different kinds of information.
  Through formal sources, e.g. journals, public information is found which
  is central to the intellectual capital. This information is not always
  contemporary, as the process leading to publication can be protracted.
  Informal sources give access to information otherwise difficult to find
  about research in progress but also information of actors, values and
  other important aspects of research, i.e. the social capital needed for
  positioning in the field. The direct interaction between people is
  central and informal exchange of information is often considered one of
  the most important sources for information. The mapping of informal
  contacts are therefore of great importance for an understanding of the
  information behaviour, in particular since different kinds of personal
  contacts are likely to give access to different kinds of information and
  the access to informal sources may vary more than access to formal
  contacts. Concerns will therefore be given to whom the doctoral students
  have contact with, what information is gathered from whom and why.</P>

<P>Access to information varies over time. At the beginning of the research
studies 
  the supervisor is likely to play a large role, not only as a mediator of
  information but also to introduce the students to interesting networks.
  As the students become socialised into the subject fields they will
  probably develop personal contacts of their own and habits for gathering
  of information. Influential factors are knowledge of sources, personal
  preferences etc. Changes over time will therefore be investigated.</P>

<P>With an in interest in information from personal contacts it is relevant
to 
  study the use of new information technology since there are opportunities
  for interaction between people with similar interest on equal conditions.
  The study will look at how male and female students use different
  functions, particularly functions involving human interaction, such as
  mailing lists. There are findings indicating that women value these kinds
  of contacts more than men do (<a href="#ref">Lincoln, 1992</a>).</P>

<P>The interest in usage of information and the effects of usage help to
see information 
  as part of daily activities. How different kinds of information are used
  and how useful different kinds of sources are. The results of the use of
  information are mirrored in how the students' information behaviour is
  affected, for example what new needs that arise due to the usage and if
  access, and thus the possibilities to satisfy the needs, are changed. It
  is also possible to look to changes in the students' total situations by
  observing production and advancement in the field as well as seeing to
  their own satisfaction. How are their theses affected? What are their
  positions in the field? Are they content with their situations and how
  are they evolving?</P>

<P>These problem areas interact in a complex pattern, which makes it
important 
  to study all of them although the focus of the study is on access to
  information through various sources. Access to information is an
  important aspect, where inequality may exist between men and women, but
  availability and different kinds of needs for information affect the
  final use of sources and consequently the information the students
  gather. Various needs may change their access to information as new
  contacts are developed with people who are perceived to have important
  information.</P>

<P>The preliminary hypotheses that the study will work with are:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>There are differences in access to and participation in social
  networks 
    between male and female doctoral students, for example types of
    personal contacts and the proximity of these contacts to the
    departments in which the students are active. These differences affect
    their information behaviour and in the long run their research
    careers.</LI>
  <LI>These differences are likely to decrease as their research studies
  proceed, 
    resulting in more equal patterns of progress of their careers.</LI>
  <LI>New information technology is important for the establishment of
  informal 
    contacts for the doctoral students, for example to build social
    networks of their own, a function which may be valued higher by female
    students than male.</LI>
</UL>


<h2>Theory</h2>

<P>The theoretical base for the study is research on information needs and
seeking 
  in library and information science. Information gathering is seen as
  being a part of a social system in which information seeking is an
  activity performed in order to satisfy personal needs (<a href="#ref">Wilson, 1997</a>). By
  stressing social dimensions a shift occurs from studying
  information-seeking behaviour to the importance of information in
  different social settings. The word gather is used in order to emphasize
  the fact that a person may not only actively seek for some specific piece
  of information but may also browse, i.e. randomly find out if something
  is of interest, or the person may receive unasked-for information from
  someone, e.g. a supervisor. The person may or may not find this
  information useful.</P>

<P>The personal sources that are of special interest in the study can be
studied 
  on an individual level but they can also be regarded as parts of various
  social networks. Social networks are here understood as contacts between
  people that are more or less regulated and continuous (<a href="#ref">H&ouml;glund &amp;
  Persson, 1985</a>). According to H&ouml;glund and Persson, information in
  these may be shared between well-informed people rather than with those
  less well-informed. Newcomers in a subject field may have difficulties
  gaining access to relevant networks (<a href="#ref">Cronin, 1982</a>). In the study the
  networks of individual doctoral students will be studied with respect to
  kinds of contacts and what information is gathered from whom
  (<a href="#ref">Haythornthwaite, 1996</a>). These networks will then be compared with one
  another.</P>

<P>Another point of departure for the study is descriptions of the academic
community 
  as a hierarchic research culture built on competition for financing as
  well as visibility as a researcher, sometimes called male. This leads to
  a need to be acknowledged by people that are higher up in the hierarchy
  (<a href="#ref">Fox, 1991</a>). In this environment informal, social networks are formed,
  normally maintained by men, and there are reasons to believe that women
  are more exposed when trying to gain access to these.</P>

<P>As a framework for interpretation of information behaviour and the
formulation 
  of research questions the so-called gender system is used (<a href="#ref">Hirdman,
  1987</a>). Gender is here understood as a social phenomenon with a
  fundamental social and structural ordering of men and women in society.
  In this relation men are generally given the preferential right of
  interpretation, leading to an uneven distribution of resources. These
  relationships are seen as circumstances in which people have
  opportunities to act. Descriptions of the academic community as a male
  research culture belong here. By such a perspective, men and women do not
  have to act differently, but women have to adjust to structural and
  cultural conditions where they do not have the same status as men.</P>

<P>Different directions of what is called The Social Shaping of Technology,
for 
  example the SCOT (Social Construction of Technology) school offer a way
  to understand information technology and its use (<a href="#ref">Bijker,<I> et al.</I>,
  1987</a>). The meaning and function of technology are considered to be
  created in different contexts, e.g. production or usage, which changes
  focus from technology as a fixed artefact towards a conception of
  flexibility and ambiguity (<a href="#ref">Lie, 1995</a>). In the study this leads to an
  awareness that information technology may have different values depending
  on who uses it and for what reasons. Feminist research on e.g. women's
  participation and experiences of computer-mediated communication are also
  of interest here (<a href="#ref">Kramarae &amp; Taylor, 1993</a>).</P>


<h2>Methods, workplan and progression</h2>

<P>The methodological point of departure for the thesis is pluralistic,
i.e. various 
  methods are used to gather and analyse empirical data. Both quantitative
  and qualitative methods elements are present, although the latter
  predominate.</P>

<P>As a preparation   of interview questions the study begins with pilot
interviews with three senior researchers about 
  their information habits and experiences from their research careers.
  Overall the thesis is based on case-studies of two research departments,
  one where research groups are common, for example in the natural
  sciences, and one where individual work dominate such as in the
  humanities. Six doctoral students from each department, three male and
  three female, in different stages of their education, will be
  interviewed, a total of twelve students. By dividing the post-graduate
  studies in three phases, initial, middle and final, and choosing two
  students from each phase, it is possible to relate different phases of
  their careers to their information behaviour.</P>

<P>Since knowledge of the social settings in which the doctoral students
are active 
  in is important, participant observation will be used to get an insight.
  Focus will be on the history of the departments, their work, culture of
  seminars etc. Complementary methods are reading of material and
  interviews with people with a good knowledge of the departments. A
  bibliometric mapping will also be done for a notion of connections
  between researchers and who are working with similar questions. This will
  later be compared with the students' personal networks for an
  understanding of their integration and positions in the field.</P>

<P>Further, to investigate the situations of the students and their
information 
  behaviour, deep interviews and diaries that the students will be asked to
  keep, will be used. The keeping of the diaries will take place during
  three separate weeks in two months. The students will account for their
  daily activities; when information is gathered and used, what type of
  information, from where etc. To reduce their workload some parts of the
  diaries will consist of ready-made alternatives.</P>

<P>There will be two interviews per student, separated by the diaries. The
initial 
  interviews will focus on a reconstruction of the students' way through
  their research studies to their present situation. In the following
  interviews the first interviews and the diaries will be followed-up with
  a deepening of their needs of information, ways of gathering information
  etc. Throughout the study, a mapping of personal networks as well as the
  use of information technology is important and will be given special
  attention.</P>

<P>In the analysis the empirical material will be used to give a picture of
the 
  departments and the doctoral students' careers. These will be compared
  with one another for examples of the interplay between context and
  information behaviour. As the study has a gender perspective special
  attention will be paid to structural and cultural circumstances which may
  affect the development of information behaviour and the research
  careers.</P>

<P>The gathering of data and writing of the thesis is planned to take four
years, 
  with data collection the first two years and analysis and writing the
  following two.</P>

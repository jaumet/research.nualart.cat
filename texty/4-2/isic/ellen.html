<h2>Introduction</h2>

<P>Telecentres are a means for providing
community access to electronic information by utilising information and
communication technologies (ICT). The research will evaluate the design,
development and implementation of such centres from an end user
perspective. The originality and significant contribution to
knowledge of this research will be to propose a bridge between two
disciplines; information systems design and community development.&nbsp;
This research is designed to provide a framework specifically for community
based telematics projects which will draw upon participatory techniques
developed based on research and practice in these two disciplines.&nbsp;
The framework will be informed by the results of field research of three
telecentres.&nbsp; The field research will not only contribute to an
understanding of users of telecentres but also non users in terms of the
aims outlined below.&nbsp; The study will not aim to generalise its
findings across all UK telecentres, but rather to provide a basis for
future investigations.

<h2>2. Aims</h2>

<ul>
<li>to identify and analyse the use of telecentres by local communities;

<li>to identify and analyse patterns of information awareness, information capability and information handling skills amongst people who utilise telecentres and non -users of telecentres;

<li>to identify and assess the impact of the strategies that have been adopted to involve end users and key actors in the design, development and implementation of telecentres;

<li>to propose a framework for combining community development theory with participatory information system design theory as a possible guide to future community telematics projects.
</ul>

<h2>3. Context and Rationale</h2>

<P>Access to electronic information is
becoming an increasingly important issue as more and more information is
provided in electronic format. The recent Green Paper (<a href="#ref">CITU,1996</a>) outlines
plans to increase the use of this communication medium.  Within
the UK telecentres are being established as well as other initiatives such
as Community Networks which provide electronic community information. 
Telecentres provide local centres where individuals can utilise ICT for
personal or business use in order to gain access to electronic
information.  These developments are aimed at providing access to ICT
to those who do not have such facilities in their own home or workplace; to
ensure that they are not excluded from accessing increasing amounts of
electronic information.  Teleservice centres typically have trained
staff dedicated to support and training for users.

<P>Research in Scandinavia has shown that
there are important factors to be considered when setting up telecentres
(<a href="#ref">Qvortrup, 1995</a>).  In order to address the issues surrounding access
to electronic information, it is important that strategies are adopted
which enable people to overcome barriers which affect use of ICT. 
Qvortrup  proposes four barriers to access ; network (physical),
service (needs), cost and qualification.  The proposed research aims
to identify other factors which affect access to teleservices by examining
the social context of their design, implementation and development. 
Telecentres are seen as one method of providing community access to ICT in
Europe.  However, research in this area has not analysed what local
communities use teleservice centres for.  <a href="#ref">Graham</a> (1992) put forward
proposals for best practice which looked at organisational requirements for
implementation of the teleservice centre model.  However, little
research has been identified which examines the impact of involving (or not
involving) end users in the design, development and implementation of
telecentres.

<P>By bringing together the aims of
identifying what local people use teleservice centres for, patterns of
information skills and the impact of community involvement in telecentres
it is intended that this study will result in strategies which could be
used to guide future development of community telematics projects. Work has
been done which looks at information systems as social systems within an
organisations (<a href="#ref">Walsham <i>et al.</i>,1988</a>), the proposed study seeks to extend
this research into a community setting.

<P>As this study will focus on the end user
perspective, the theoretical framework for the research methods being
adopted here follows that suggested by <a href="#ref">Dervin and Nilan</a> (1986).  Their
study of information needs and uses called for a paradigm shift from a
system-based focus toward one which views users as active players in the
design and implementation of systems geared towards meeting their
information requirements.  The proposed research will adopt Dervin's
Sense-Making theory to study users' experiences of telecentres (i.e.
information and communication system design, implementation and
practice).  The standard Sense-Making triangle of
situation-gap-help/use will be utilised in this study to examine the aims set out above.

<h2>4. Research methods</h2>

<p>The research will be an exploratory study
which will use the case study research strategy.  Sense-Making as the
key data collection technique is an intensive and potentially
time-consuming process.  Taking this factor into account, as well as
the time frame of the research and available resources, it is proposed that
three telecentres will be investigated.  The telecentres will be
selected from a target population as listed by the Telecottage Association
(139 in the October 1996 (<a href="#ref">Anon</a>)) using  ten criteria.  All data
collection and analysis will be piloted at a separate telecentres prior to
carrying out the research on the three telecentres selected.

<p>A literature review will include work
to identify significant research in the fields of community development and
user led information systems design in order to inform the resulting
framework for community telematics projects.

<P>Data collection to achieve aims will rely on multiple sources of evidence, including: 

<ul>
<li><B>Documentation:</B> key documents such as project proposals, progress reports and evaluations that have been
undertaken will be used to provide background information.  Other sources will include minutes of meetings, reports of events, articles appearing in the mass media. 

<li><b>Archival records:</B> service records, organisational records.

<li><B>Interviews:</B>  open ended interviews (using Sense-Making theory)  will be carried out with a sample of users, key actors and people living in the catchment area of the centres identified to be investigated (up to 30 people in total at each telecentre). 

<li><B>Data analysis</B> Atlas/ti software will be used to process and analyse data gathered from the open ended interviews.  Content analysis as used in numerous Sense-Making studies will be used (Dervin, 1983 and
Shields et al, 1993).; Content analysis will also be used for analysis of documentary and archival records. A case study
database will be established in order to allow for detailed examination of all interviews and documentation.
</ul>

<h2>6. Progress to date</h2>

<P>The start date for this PhD was March 1997
and the expected completion date is December 1999.&nbsp; A pilot study has
been completed, data has been processed, analysed and a draft case study
report has been written.  The research design utilised parts of the
research instrument used for a study of everyday information needs
undertaken in 1976 (<a href="#ref">Dervin <i>et al.</i></a>), which used Sense-Making.  The
decision to use a tried and tested research instrument was taken because of
the potential for comparative work spanning two decades during which there
have been enormous changes in information seeking tools.  Early
reactions to using Sense-Making as a mechanism for data collection are
positive in terms of the richness of the data produced.

<P>Data processing is being carried out using
a Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS) package
called Atlas/ti.  This product was chosen in preference to NUD*IST
because it was felt to be a more flexible and user friendly tool. 
Data from the pilot study was processed using a mixture of coding
techniques.  For some aspects of the study content analysis schemes
developed by <a href="#ref">Dervin <i>et al.</i></a> (1976) were used.  For example, Dervin et
al. developed a scheme for topic focus for everyday information
needs and situations.  This was used to enable comparisons to be made
between the two studies.  Other data was coded as themes and patterns
emerged.  This process has laid the foundation for data to be
collected for the main study, which is now underway.

<P>Data collection for the first case study of
an urban telecentre was carried out during July and analysis of this data
has just begun (consequently few results are available as this thesis
summary is being written).  Data for the other two case studies is
scheduled to be collected in September and November.  Plans for the
main study were revised, allowing more time for data processing and
analysis as a result of experience gained from the pilot study.  The
plan is that each case will be completed, data processed and analysed
before the next begins, in order to learn from each research cycle.

<h3>Changes to research design following the pilot</h3>  

The study was designed so that use (or non use) of
electronic information could be seen in the context of people's everyday
lives.  However, it was important that people were not led down a path
focusing on situations where they had used electronic information. 
Therefore respondents were asked to talk about everyday problems worries
and concerns that had affected them in the past month or so, following the
approach taken in the Seattle study (<a href="#ref">Dervin et al. 1976</a>).  There was
some initial concern that this strategy could lead to a lack of data about
electronic information.  Consequently, the research instrument was
modified by adding a series of questions at the end of the interview to
explore people's perceptions of electronic information available via the
Internet.  Hypothetical situations are discussed and then respondents
are asked if they would consider using any aspect of the Internet to deal
with these situations, and what would get in the way of them using the
Internet.  Putting these questions at the end of the interview avoided
the possibility of leading respondents into talking about use of the
Internet.

<h4>Emerging themes</h4>
<UL>
<LI>
The importance of informal information and
communication in dealing with everyday situations;</LI> </UL>  
<UL> <LI> Access - the most important factor
is cost, not providing the hardware.  People do not feel they have
access when they have to pay &pound;3.00 per hour to use a
service;</LI> </UL>   <UL>
<LI> Patterns of usage - people either use
alternative information sources or seek out access that is free (friends,
college, businesses out of office hours);</LI> </UL>   <UL> <LI> Need for support in using the Internet - this is
crucial in order to encourage novice users not providing support will
effectively exclude a large number of people;</LI> </UL>   <UL> <LI> The Internet is becoming too slow for efficient
use;</LI> </UL>   <UL> <LI>
Online shopping - hypothetical situations show
a lack of enthusiasm for this activity;</LI> </UL>   <UL> <LI>
Older people - those interviewed have been
enthusiastic to learn about the Internet.</LI> </UL>   <UL>
<LI> Community involvement strategies - few
identified from the pilot and first case study; development is driven by
category of funding sources available.</LI> </UL> 

<h4>Use of enabling technologies</h4>

<P>At the outset of the study there was a
strong commitment to utilise enabling technologies such as voice
recognition software as a means of speeding up the transcription process;
the use of a scanner, optical character recognition and indexing software
(Zyimage) to facilitate the preparation of documents for analysis and the
use of software to process data for analysis.

<P><B>Voice recognition software</B> 
Initial experience of using voice recognition software (IBM Via Voice) has
not been very favourable.  The plan was to listen to recorded
interviews and simultaneously repeat the speech running it through the
voice recognition software.  This has been a qualified success. 
Great patience is required to `train' the software to recognise your
individual speech pattern, and this process is an extremely slow one. 
Once the software has interpreted what has been said, the user must correct
each mis-understood word in order to up date the personal speech
file.  Failure to do this creates a situation where errors made by the
software are repeated again and again.  For example if you say `I wear
a red jacket' and the software interprets this as `I tear a red jacket'
just over typing `tear' with `wear' will mean that every subsequent use of
the word `wear' will be interpreted as `tear'.  To correct
mis-understood words is a time-consuming process when the number of errors
can be 30% of the text.  Consequently, it is faster to simply type the
transcript and not use the voice recognition software.  Undoubtedly
voice recognition software has the potential to ease the burden of
transcribing interviews, but in this case it has had to be
abandoned.

<P><B>Zyimage </B>  Use of a
scanner, optical character recognition and indexing software (Zyimage) has
not yet been attempted, but once the technology is up and running this will
be tried.  What is interesting about this tool is that documents can
first be scanned and then indexed by Zyimage, subsequently retrieved in raw
text form, then imported into Atlas/ti for processing.  That is the
theory anyway.  In this way key documents can be coded and analysed
within the same unit as the transcribed interviews, allowing for links to
be made across the two types of data using the CAQDAS software.

<P><B>Atlas/ti </B> The CAQDAS package
has been extremely useful.  It is an easy and powerful package to
use.  A wide range of reports can be provided with little difficulty,
visual representations of data can be created and everything can be
converted to HTML for ease of web publishing.  Documents are
introduced into Atlas/ti as simple text files and then the user begins the
process of coding by selecting text, called `quotations' which are assigned
codes.  In addition memos can be created and quotations, codes and
memos can be linked together.  All three can have comments assigned to
them to facilitate consistency during the coding process.  Memos can
be used to begin the process of theory building as you process the
data.  Documents, codes and memos can be organised into 'families'
which is extremely useful for filtering data during coding and analysis.
Users see the codes alongside the data (although one drawback is that it is
not yet possible to have a report which replicates this screen view). 
Unlike NUD*IST, its more well known competitor, Atlas/ti is flexible in its
treatment of text.  Coding within a document can be done at a word,
phrase, sentence or paragraph level.  An active discussion list
provides useful support to people getting to grips with using the software
for the first time.  There is no doubt that time spent learning how to
use this software would be well spent.

<h4>Further 
improvements</h4>

<P>Overall, the study is meeting its research
aims and objectives.  However, one area of concern relates to the
issue of interviewing non users.  The focus for approaching non users
was the local library (because it is another place people go to seek
information).  Posters asking for volunteers were put up in the
library a week before data collection began.  No-one came forward
having seen the posters.  It was difficult for the researcher to
approach non users in the library, and communicate the reasons for wanting
to interview people NOT using the telecentre without providing too much
leading information about the study.  Consequently, the data
collection took longer than planned.  This problem will be addressed
by asking telecentre staff to approach users before the beginning of the
data collection period (and if possible organise appointments for
interviews) leaving more time to approach non users.

<P>Another area causing concern is how to
assess peoples information awareness, information capability and
information handling skills based on the data collected (research aim
2.2).  Investigation of literature has not revealed any work in this
area.  Research into how teachers assess pupils information handling
skills under the national curriculum did not provide a framework, as
assessment is based around subject areas, rather than overall skills in
this area.  Any ideas from workshop participants on this issue would
be very helpful, as it would be good not to have to reinvent the wheel if
something already exists.

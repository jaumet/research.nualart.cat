<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We may argue that in most cases it is unclear, what exactly is the role of
databases, or more generally, the role of the new technology in the
journalistic practice. In this regard the new methods of information
gathering are of special interest.

<p>News writing has its own rules and assumptions which direct the work of the
journalists. The same principles apply to a somewhat looser extent to all
other types of journalistic items as well; for instance a feature piece can
be written in a number of ways and styles, but regardless of the style it
attempts to catch something important, relevant or essential. How are
databases or digital information then used in journalistic item writing?

<p>Databases are said to have at least two implications in journalistic work
process. On the one hand, it is argued that electronic databases are going
to revolutionise the editorial work and computer-assisted journalism is
said to be the future of the art. On the other hand, it is claimed that
databases have no significant effect on writing. Computer-assisted
journalism is a more general term describing the use of a wide variety of
software like spreadsheets, word processors, databases and so on. (<a href="#ref2">Koch
1991</a>). In textbooks of journalism the potential benefits of online
searching for reporters and editors are hardly being mentioned. It has not
been demonstrated how or in which way databases are to revolutionise
journalistic work. Similarly, little is known about specific benefits and
problems which systematically result from using databases for reporting.

<p>One reason for the lack of systematic consideration on the effects of
electronic databases on journalism may be the widely held but largely
unexamined assumption that computer-assisted journalism utilising
databases is just the same old journalism but with better tools. One may
argue that the effect of using databases in the context of news writing, or
journalistic work in general, is and will be minimal. It is assumed that
databases will help the work of organising information and bringing data to
the reporter, but changes will have no fundamental effect on journalistic
work or on the structure of an item itself. (<a href="#ref2">Koch 1991</a>)

<p>A different matter altogether is, that technology effects shapes but the
essence of journalism or other undertakings remains, as the Finnish
journalist Pasi Karonen has noted. (<a href="#ref">Fabritius & Karonen 1997</a>)

<p>Like in most other professions the use of information systems and
information retrieval applications does not form the main goal of the work
tasks of journalists; it takes a minor and supporting role. However,
information seeking is an essential element in the journalistic work.

<p>The cognitive framework is, originally, intended to be a method for both
analysing the work context and developing and evaluating the interactive
retrieval systems. So far, this framework has been used to design and
evaluate information retrieval systems in libraries and manufacturing
companies (<a href="#ref">Goodstein and Mark Pejtersen 1989</a>; <a href="#ref2">Mark Pejtersen and Fidel
1998</a>; <a href="#ref2">Rasmussen, Mark Pejtersen and Goodstein 1994</a>).

<p>The purpose of this paper is to consider, whether the framework for work
centred evaluation and design, developed by L.P. Goodstein, Annelise Mark
Pejtersen and Jens Rasmussen, would be applicable for analysis of the
information searching process, the journalistic item process and, finally,
the journalistic practice in general.

<p>Logically, the next step would be to consider, whether the digital
information retrieval systems do support the journalistic work practice.
This phase of evaluation, in case, would be conducted at a later stage and
would possibly form a subject for another article. The subsequent topic
would be to see, how well or badly the systems indeed do match the
journalists´ resources and preferences. The results of this kind of
analysis would be suggestions and recommendations as to how to develop and
improve the interactive information retrieval systems so, that they may
better serve the requirements of the journalists. The conduct of this
direction, if any, would, as a matter of course, depend on the
applicability of the cognitive framework in relation to the journalistic
practice.

<p>The following step would be to assess the appropriateness of the
cognitive, work centred framework: how feasible it is in decribing or
analysing the work context of the journalists.

<p>However, it is as well important to evaluate the framework as a
theoretical construction: which are the benefits and shortcomings of the
cognitive framework itself, and how easy or difficult is it to apply.


<h2>Research Objectives</h2>

<p>The purpose of the current study is to investigate, what is the role of
digital information in journalistic writing, how the journalists utilise
information technology and how well or badly the digital systems support
journalistic work.

<p>My  ongoing, empirical research is guided by the principles of the
grounded theory introduced by Glaser and Strauss (<a href="#ref2">Strauss & Corbin, 1990</a>).
The approach of this study can be characterised as a user-oriented one but
the journalists are taken primarily as producers, or doers, not only
consumers, or users. From this point of view it is important to try to find
out what the impact of the new, digital technology on the journalistic work
is. The content of the term "new technology" is quite broad, including
online databases, CD-ROM files, Internet resources like the World Wide Web,
different search engines and e-mail. In the first place I am interested in
in-house databases, because in the Finnish press it is obvious that in the
near future the utilisation of the new methods in information gathering
will increase, starting from the use of in-house databases -- called
electronic archives, too.

<p>The study focuses on two issues of interest; firstly, the journalistic work
practice and the journalists´ information environment, and secondly, the
role of digital information in news reporting, which is the main issue of
the study. The research questions are as follows.

<blockquote>
<p>I. What kind of task is news reporting as a journalistic work process? What
is the nature of the information environment of journalists? What kinds of
sources do the journalists use? Do they find these sources satisfactory?
Which problems and barriers have they faced while using these sources,
particularly digital information?

<p>II. What is the role of digital information in the journalistic work; in
particular, in covering the news events? What is the purpose of the search
for digital information in preparing a particular piece of news or other
journalistic item? How are the digital sources utilised? Is digital
information replacing or complementing some traditional ways to seek
information? If so, which sources are being replaced? What is the
relationship between digital information and information acquired or sought
from other sources?
</blockquote>

<p>The journalistic information searching behaviour is investigated by means
of seven hierarchical concepts. When moving from general to more specific
the concepts are: the journalistic culture, the medium´s culture, the
department´s culture, the journalistic work practice, the journalistic item
process, the information seeking and retrieval processes.

<h2>Data and Methods</h2>

<p>The data was collected in Helsingin Sanomat, which is the largest
newspaper in Finland, in 1996 and 1997. The research questions required
application of several methods. The primary methods of data gathering were
observation, interviews and diaries.

<p>The observation conducted during the research can be defined as
participant observation. In order to clarify the nature of the
journalistic work practice and the journalistic culture, the journalists
were requested to talk aloud during observation sessions. At the early
stage of the study, the main purpose of the observation was to gain deeper
understanding of the journalistic work practice.

<p>The purpose of the interviews conducted at the initial stage was to focus
on the issues that could not be answered through observation only. In the
open-ended, active interviews the journalists were encouraged to offer
their own point of view of the subjects under discussion: work processes,
selection of the journalistic items, definitions of news criteria,
information seeking and the use of digital information sources etc. Thirty
journalists were interviewed. In order to gain contextual information also
archivists and technical staff responsible for the information storage and
he whole information management of the in-house databases and the training
of journalists in the utilisation of the digital systems were interviewed.

<p>A structured document as a diary of the journalistic item process was
developed in order to study a journalistic item practice in detail. The
term "journalistic item" refers to pieces of news, editorial articles and
other journalistic texts. The journalists were asked to write down the
headline of the journalistic item, the type of the item, the timing and how
the idea for the item was got. The diary suggests a list of information
sources. The journalists were asked to fill in the diaries, which sources
they used, what was the purpose of the source, how important they estimated
the source to be, and which were the greatest difficulties in using each
source. Eighteen of thirty interviewed journalists agreed to fill in the
diaries. The number of  filled diaries was 250.

<p>Data analysis was utilised at this stage of data collection. The printed
pieces of news and other journalistic items were studied. Thereafter, the
processes of news writing and information seeking, and especially the
utilisation of digital information were discussed with journalists. The
interviewing sessions concerning filled diaries were repeated as many time
as needed. 

<p>For the analysis various documents produced in the newspaper office were
gathered, for example lists of work shifts and agendas of daily editorial
meetings. In addition, photographs describing certain work situations were
taken. The combination of methods varied and developed along the course of
the field work, reflecting the ways in which the researcher managed to get
a deeper understanding of the phenomena under study.

<h2>The Cognitive Framework for Analysis of the Work Context</h2>

<p>L.P. Goodstein, Annelise Mark Pejtersen and Jens Rasmussen have introduced
a framework to guide the definitions of boundary conditions that can be
used in empirical evaluation studies. The framework for work centred
evaluation and design can be used both analysing and evaluation and the
approaches taken can be analytical or empirical. (<a href="#ref2">Mark Pejtersen &
Rasmussen 1997, 6 -17</a>; <a href="#ref2">Rasmussen, Mark Pejtersen and Goodstein 1994</a>).

<p>Analysis of the work context is a top down process that begins with the
analysis of the task domain and moves on to the user. Evaluation is a
bottom up process that begins with the user and moves towards the broad
work context. (<a href="#ref2">Mark Pejtersen and Fidel 1998, 4</a>). 

<p>I shall use the work centred framework to describe and analyse actual work
situations of journalists. Concerning the journalistic work practice and
information seeking, particularly, there are very few field studies using
ethnographic approach and multiple, qualitative methods. In this paper it
is my aim to evaluate the applicability of the cognitive framework of the
work context for the description and analysis the work practice of
journalists. Logically the next step would be to look at how the digital
information storage and retrieval systems support the journalistic work
context and whether the systems match the journalists´ resources and
preferences. Although the next phase depends on the experiences from
application of the work context part of the cognitive framework, it is
reasonable or worth doing.

<p>By analysing the work context I shall try to find answers for the first
batch of the research questions regarding the context of the journalistic
work and the journalists´ information environment. This has to be done
before it is possible to find answers to the matter related to the role of
digital information in the journalistic work and the use of the digital
sources by the journalists in the work process.


<h2>The work domain, means - ends space</h2>

<p>This dimension represents the landscape within which the work takes place.
It serves to make explicit its goals, constraints which govern actors´ work
activities, independent of particular situations and tasks. It identifies
the functional elements and their means - ends relations. In other words it
describes the productive resources that are available. (<a href="#ref2">Mark Pejtersen &
Fidel 1998, 4</a>; <a href="#ref2">Mark Pejtersen & Rasmussen 1997, 7</a>)

<p>The analysis of means and ends is structured at several levels of
functional abstraction. These are:

<ul>
<li>Goals and Constraints
<li>Priority
<li>General function
<li>Work process 
<li>Physical resources
</ul>


<h3>Activity analysis: task situation in domain terms</h3>

This level, or dimension, requires a means - ends analysis which is
relevant for a particular task. (<a href="#ref2">Mark Pejtersen & Fidel 1998, 4-5</a>; <a href="#ref2">Mark
Pejtersen & Rasmussen 1997, 7-8</a>)

<h3>Activity analysis: task situation decision terms (cognitive decisions)</h3>

This representation breaks down work activities into subroutines that can
be related to the cognitive activities of the involved people and that
serves to identify the cognitive tasks that are the targets for support
systems. The information gained in this analysis will identify the
knowledge items which are relevant for a particular decision task, together
with the required information about their functional relationships. (<a href="#ref2">Mark
Pejtersen & Fidel 1998, 6</a>; <a href="#ref2">Mark Pejtersen & Rasmussen 1997, 8</a>)

<h3>Activity analysis in terms of mental strategies</h3>

A mental strategy is a category of cognitive task procedures which are
based on a particular kind of mental model and the related interpretation
of information, and of a particular set of tactical rules. A further
analysis of the decision task requires another shift in language in order
to be able to compare task requirements with the cognitive resources and
subjective preferences of the individual actors. For this purpose, the
mental strategies that can be used for each of the decision functions are
identified by detailed analysis of the actual work performance. The
characteristics of the various strategies are identified with respect to
subjective performance criteria such as time needed, cognitive strain,
amount of information required, and cost of failure. (<a href="#ref2">Mark Pejtersen &
Fidel 1998, 6</a>; <a href="#ref2">Mark Pejtersen & Rasmussen 1997, 8</a>)


<h3>User characteristics, individual actor´s resources</h3>

The degrees of freedom in work performance of the individual have been
delimited by identifying the work- related constraints down to the level of
mental strategies which individual actors can use for making decisions. In
order to judge whether a given factor is able to meet the requirements and
determine the approach to work which might be chosen, the resource profile.
This perspective of analysis is focused on the background of the relevant
user category and the level of expertise, and the performance criteria of
individual actors. (<a href="#ref2">Mark Pejtersen & Fidel 1998, 7</a>; <a href="#ref2">Mark Pejtersen &
Rasmussen 1997, 8-9</a>)


<h3>Organisational analysis, allocation of decision roles</h3>

The principles and criteria that determine the allocation of roles among
the groups and individuals involved should be identified. This phase of the
analysis identifies the scope of the information window which should be
available for an actor during a particular work situation and the
information exchange with cooperators needed for coordination. (<a href="#ref2">Mark
Pejtersen & Fidel 1998, 7</a>; <a href="#ref2">Mark Pejtersen & Rasmussen 1997, 9</a>)

<h3>Social organisation, management structure</h3>

Management structure influences the subjective performance criteria of the
actors and therefore, indirectly the formulation of goals and constraints.
Identification of the communication conventions underlying the social
organisation is necessary. A work analysis will not proceed as an orderly
top-down, starting with the work domain and finishing with the user
characteristics, users´ cognitive resources and value criteria. The broader
context of the entire work environment will be activated during the
analysis of both task activity and user characteristics. In particular, the
analysis of the work domain and the task situation and frequent iterations
among the perspectives will be necessary. (<a href="#ref2">Mark Pejtersen & Rasmussen 1997,
9</a>)

<h2>Introduction</h2> 
 
<p>The aim of the study was to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>the information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of peri-menopausal women and to relate the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to an <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>model of everyday information <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> There is currently debate about the meaning and appropriateness of the terms <em>information pratices</em> and <em>information behaviour</em> (<a href="#sav07">Savolainen 2007</a>; <a href="#wil09">Wilson 2009</a>). The debate is still open and the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span><em>information practices</em> will be used in this paper for consistency with McKenzie's original model.</p>

<p>A large number of information-behaviour or practice models have been generated by information researchers but many have done little to add to the generation of theory. For Bates (<a href="#bat05">Bates 2005</a>), models are a tool in the development of theory but they must be tested for validity and it is this process alone that can turn them into true theory. However, few existing models are being tested and their role in the process of theory generation, therefore, is  restricted. Such models are <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>based on small studies that are context-bound. To consolidate the research base and <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>it forwards, a process of <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>models in different <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>should be encouraged.</p> 
 
<p>This study, though admittedly small-scale and context-bound itself, takes a step towards redressing the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>by <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>McKenzie's model of information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in everyday life information seeking in a different, yet related, context. McKenzie studied the information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of 19 Canadian women pregnant with twins. She <span>devised</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>a two-dimensional model of everyday life information-seeking which <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to 'reflect the idiosyncracies of multiple pregnancy as an information-seeking context and to identify the patterns and concepts that might translate to other <span>contexts</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> (<a href="#mck01">McKenzie 2001</a>). McKenzie charts her research from an initial intention to explore the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of two <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of information practice (<em>active</em> and <em>incidental</em> information-seeking), through a realization that data emerging from accounts were so rich that the original dichotomous goal seemed inadequate, to the development of the final model (Figure 1) which portrayed four <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of information practice:</p> 
 
<ol>
<li>Active seeking: in which participants specifically <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>out a known <span>source</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> conducted a systematic known-item <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>or asked a planned question etc.</li>
<li>Active scanning: in which they identified a particular <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>as likely to be helpful or a particular location as a potential information ground (<a href="#pet99">Pettigrew 1999</a>). </li>
<li>Non-directed monitoring: in which participants serendipitously encountered a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in an unlikely place or whilst monitoring information sources such as newspapers. </li>
<li>By proxy: in which participants encountered sources through the initiative of another agent. </li> 
 </ol>

 <div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 1: McKenzie's model of information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in everyday life information seeking</strong> (<a href="#mck03">McKenzie 2003</a>)</div>
 
<p>Each of these <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>could itself <span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in either of two stages of the information process: <em>connecting with</em> and <em>interacting with</em> sources of information.</p> 

<p>When making <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>(Phase 1 of the model), participants described <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>involved in identifying (or being identified by) and making contact with (or being contacted by) potential sources and barriers that could inhibit this process. After initial contact was made with a <span>source</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>interaction <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>the second phase of the model. McKenzie suggested that information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>(e.g.. asking <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>questions or being persistent) could be used as counter-strategies to combat barriers. In a <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>publication McKenzie (<a href="#mck02">McKenzie 2002</a>) expanded on the concept of connection and communication barriers and identified how the communication-process between pregnant women and their information sources could break down: <span>failure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to ask questions; disclosure barriers (source unable or unwilling to disclose an answer); <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of realization or comprehension; and connection failures during the communication process.</p>

<p>McKenzie viewed twin pregnancy as an unexpected <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in which previously-existing networks of formal and informal help and information might not be <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to meet a woman's needs. From the literature and the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of her own study she identified two interpretative repertoires that described the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of multiple pregnancy: the first focussing on the commonality of experience (the fact that all women in such a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>are likely to encounter similar challenges and attitudes), and the second on the uniqueness of the experience (each woman will have her own experience of the pregnancy). </p>

<p>The menopause transition provides a contrasting, yet related, context in which to <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>the model. Komesaroff (<a href="#kom97">Komesaroff 1997</a>) notes <span>parallels</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>between the states of pregnancy and menopause: each is experienced by women; is culturally and biomedically defined in relation to notions of reproductive femininity; is medically managed in industrialized countries; and is commonly described in hormonal terms. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> like twin pregnancy, the menopause reflects McKenzie's interpretative repertoires of commonality of experience (the menopause <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>for the majority of women) and individuality (as for pregnancy, each woman's experience of the menopause transition is unique to her). </p>

<p>Despite these similarities, there are notable differences between the two states, with contrasting cultural <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>towards pregnancy and the menopause. Western cultures <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>imbue the menopause with negative associations reflecting <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>towards ageing in general and, according to many feminist writers, towards ageing women in particular (e.g.,  <a href="#gre91">Greer 1991</a>, <a href="#mar97"> Martin 1997</a>, <a href="#oak07">Oakley 2007</a>). Unlike pregnancy the menopause is not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>visible to others and in fact many women strive to keep it a private matter. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> although the menopause transition usually has a <span>finite</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>duration it is often longer than that associated with pregnancy and may last for several years. For a woman experiencing her menopause transition, the time-lines of care may not be as <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>as those experienced in pregnancy: her needs may change over time and levels of and <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to care may <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>on a woman's personal <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and on her encounters with individual members of the healthcare professions.</p> 

<h2>Methods</h2>

<h3>Participants</h3>

<ol>
<li>A previous research project provided a contact at a National Health Service (NHS) <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>menopause clinic in a market town in eastern England. Further discussion with this contact resulted in an invitation to carry out a service-audit which would in turn provide access to clinic patients.</li>
<li>Through a further contact, it was possible to interview a midlife woman who lived in the town where the NHS menopause clinic was based but who had not attended the clinic.</li>
<li>A woman who lived near to the NHS clinic but did not know of it agreed to participate after <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>about the study on the Internet.</li>
<li>Access to midlife women working in a care-home in south-east England was negotiated through a personal contact.</li>
</ol>

<p>In all, thirty-five interviews were carried out and one further participant from the menopause clinic cohort provided a <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>by mail. All interviews were conducted in 2004/2005. Of the interviews, twenty-six were with patients of the menopause clinic (recruited through their participation in the questionnaire-based service-audit carried out for the clinic); <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>were with staff at the care-home; and two were with the women from the same geographical area as the clinic but who had not attended it. </p> 

<h3>Survey instruments</h3>

<p>In seeking to <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>a study that would support the <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of an existing model, precedents were <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in the literature. Despite the large number of models and the acknowledgement by authors that their models/frameworks should be tested and refined across a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#wil99">Wilson 1999</a>,  <a href="#joh03">Johnson 2003</a>), there is little evidence of <span>testing</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> Research by Beverley <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#bev07">Beverley <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>), published too <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to inform the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of the menopause transition study, tested Wilson's (<a href="#wil99">Wilson 1999</a>) revised model of information behaviour and that of Moore (<a href="#moo02">Moore 2002</a>) in the context of the information behaviour of visually-impaired people seeking health and social care information. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>study by Veinot (<a href="#vei09">Veinot 2009</a>), which compared <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>from interviews with people with HIV/AIDS and their friends and family members to Haythornthwaite's (<a href="#hay96">Haythornthwaite 1996</a>) theory of network-based information processes and Talja and Hansen's collaborative information behaviour <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#tal06">Talja and Hansen 2006</a>), was likewise published too <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to be reflected in the study <span>design</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>In a similar approach to that taken by Beverley et al., the aim of the menopause transition study was not to replicate McKenzie's methods <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>but to find a complementary approach that would be appropriate for the subject whilst permitting analysis in the context of McKenzie's <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> The data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>methods employed by McKenzie (<a href="#mck01">McKenzie 2001</a>) were face-to-face interviews and periodic check-in telephone interviews which <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>the basis of a research diary. The diary was in turn used to structure follow-up interviews. The scope of the menopause study did not permit the charting of information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span><span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>participants' menopause transitions and one-off in-depth interviews were identified as the most appropriate method. Given the different timescales between pregnancy and the menopause, a follow-up interview after a short interval would have been unlikely to have produced many new instances of relevant information <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>In a further departure from McKenzie's original methodology, the free-text responses to the service-audit questionnaire were included if they were relevant to the wider discussion of information practice. The service-audit questionnaire was distributed to 216 registered patients of the NHS menopause clinic, of whom 199 returned completed questionnaires. The majority of the questions focussed specifically on the service provided by the clinic and therefore had <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>value for the wider discussion. Some free-text questions however did elicit responses that could be incorporated into the information-practice discussion (e.g. responses to the question 'Have you ever had problems <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>the menopause advice you needed?').</p>

<p>The interview guide took the form of an initial invitation for participants to talk about their experience of the menopause. The remaining topics were used as prompts and were <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to help interviewees <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>on their information <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> To ensure that participants were given the same opportunities as McKenzie's interviewees to comment on their information <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> similar topics to those raised by McKenzie were included (e.g. whether participants had ever found information that conflicted with something they knew or thought, and whether there was anything they worried about but had not asked about). Topics identified from the piloting process as being relevant to the menopause were also included, for example at what point women decided they needed to look for advice or information about the menopause and where they would be most likely to turn for support. Despite accepting a need to be guided by McKenzie's interview guide to ensure a level of comparability between <span>findings</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> it was important not to <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>interviewees actively or inadvertently towards giving similar answers. For this reason participants were given the opportunity to <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves freely as they told their menopause stories and a flexible approach was taken to asking additional questions.</p> 
 
<p>The original aim was for all interviews to be face-to-face but logistical problems precluded this. The <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>care-home interviews were carried out face-to-face but the twenty-eight remaining interviews were by telephone. There are acknowledged disadvantages to telephone interviewing, especially for in-depth <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>interviews, since it clearly <span>limits</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>opportunities for the researcher to <span>observe</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>the interviewee and pick up non-verbal clues that might help interpretation (<a href="#bry01">Bryman 2001</a>; <a href="#fra96">Frankfort-Nachmias and David 1996</a>; <a href="#pay04">Payne 2004</a>). <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> it is possible that interviewees may be more reticent about giving sensitive information via the telephone, and feminist researchers point out the value of face-to-face encounters which foster relationship-building (<a href="#fin93">Finch 1993</a>, <a href="#oak81">Oakley 1981</a>). Payne (<a href="#pay04">Payne 2004</a>), however, suggests that a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of physical presence may be an advantage in that respondents are less likely to react to an interviewer's appearance and may feel safer in an anonymous relationship. Comparison of the experiences of face-to-face interviews and telephone interviews suggests that in the case of the menopause study the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of the experience and of the information provided was not greatly <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>by the method of interviewing. The use of telephone interviews allowed participants the flexibility to choose the time of their interview (often in the evening to fit around family and/or work commitments). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>tape recorder was used, thereby allowing the researcher give full <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to the interviewee <span>throughout</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> Every attempt was made to remain sensitive to the need to give telephone interviewees time to think through their replies and any points of uncertainty were clarified since there were no <span>visual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>clues to aid interpretation. There was little <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in the depth of interview <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>by either method although, perhaps surprisingly, several of the face-to-face interviews were con0erably shorter than the telephone interviews. This was most likely due to variables other than the method of delivery: menopause clinic participants had all <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>professional help in dealing with their menopause whereas some care-home participants stated that they had relatively few symptoms and felt they had little to say about their menopause experiences.</p> 

<h3>Reflections on the methodology and analysis</h3>

<p>The data from the service-audit questionnaires were analysed using a spreadsheet to provide simple descriptive statistics that satisfied the requirements of the clinic evaluation. Responses to open-ended questions were then included in the information-practices analysis where appropriate. Interview transcripts were analysed in a process of thematic coding using NVIVO <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>data analysis <span>software</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> Interviews were coded first for themes that emerged relating to experiences of the menopause, <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>towards it, and information <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>second round of coding focussed on categories relating to McKenzie's model (e.g., for instances of specific information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>such as examples of active scanning activities).</p>

<p>Data from the menopause study were then applied to McKenzie's model, a process which presented three <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>challenges:</p> 
 
<ol>
<li>Understanding another researcher's thought process is not always easy unless the second researcher is able to question the first and explore their reasons for <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>a particular decision or has access to a record of the decision-making process;</li>
<li>The different context meant that women's recollection of events was not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>as sharp as that of McKenzie's interviewees whose accounts related to relatively recent encounters; and </li>
<li>Some examples of information practice did not seem to fit neatly within McKenzie's model (e.g., the concept of women having a role in disseminating information to others). </li>
</ol>

<p>Limitations of the study included that fact that, along with many similar studies, this was small-scale. Most interviews were with menopause clinic patients who had therefore experienced symptoms severe enough to warrant seeking help. Attempts were made to redress this with a cohort from non-clinic environments. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> participants' accounts <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>spanned several years which could impact on recall. This was in contrast to McKenzie's participants whose accounts featured more recent events. This last point illustrates one of the challenges of attempting to <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>an existing model. As well as dealing with the other issues encountered during analysis (the need to understand the original researcher's decision-making and the question of how to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with elements that do not fit the model), a researcher must give careful con0eration to the study design: how far should the new study <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>the original in terms of, for example,  <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>instruments and size of sample? Beverley <em>et al.</em> explain that their study-design was based on the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of a literature review and informed by consultation with visually-impaired people and the suggestions of advisors. They do not specify, however, whether the study <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>was <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>by those of the researchers whose models they were <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#bev07">Beverley <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>). The decision taken in the menopause study was to attempt to find a <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>between allowing participants to give their views freely in a way that would be true to the new context whilst ensuring that data would have validity when applied to the model.</p> 

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>In common with <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>from other studies of midlife women (e.g.,  <a href="#iml08">Im <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>, <a href="#pri08">Price <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>), participants had mixed feelings about the menopause transition. The themes that emerged from the analysis can be loosely grouped into four categories: making sense of the situation; interpretative repertoires of the menopause; receiving and providing advice, information and support; and challenges in encounters with information and support.  These are discussed below.</p>

<h3>Making sense of the situation</h3>

<p>Participants viewed the menopause as 'part and parcel of life' and saw it within the context of their whole lives. For several this interpretation <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>decisions on managing the menopause as they <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>out natural ways of controlling their symptoms. Despite this <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>acceptance of the menopause as something natural and inevitable, it could still be unsettling and uncomfortable and could affect participants in ways beyond <span>purely</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>physical symptoms. Several mentioned feelings of dread or lowness that took away their enjoyment of life and many found themselves coping with the menopause along0e emotional and <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>challenges in their personal lives (e.g., ageing parents, adapting to life as an older mother). Many feminist writers (e.g.,  <a href="#gre91">Greer 1991</a>; <a href="#cam97">Campioni 1997</a>; <a href="#gul97">Gullette 1997</a>) urge women to view the menopause as a watershed, a time to <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>towards an older, stronger self. However it can be a challenging time for women, and renegotiating self-image is not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>easy. Participants spoke of striving to find a <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>between not wanting to stay permanently young, whilst not wishing to be <em>old</em>. Some explained that menopausal women can feel '<em>a bit of a failure</em>' and that there is a common <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that midlife women who do acknowledge their problems are simply seeking <span>attention</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>Interpretative repertoires of the menopause</h3>

<p>McKenzie's (<a href="#mck01">McKenzie 2001</a>) contrasting interpretative repertoires that characterize pregnancy (commonality of experience or uniqueness of the individual) are equally <span>valid</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>for the menopause. Participants in the menopause study saw their experiences as enmeshed with those of other women and actively <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>out information about other women's menopause stories to provide context and validation for their own. They <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to the experiences of family members and friends and to anecdotes. They would particularly look to their mothers' experiences to attempt to predict the course of their own menopause. However, whilst acknowledging that it is an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>experience of womanhood, interviewees were aware that each woman's menopause transition was entirely her own. Women who experienced few or relatively mild symptoms con0ered themselves lucky and were perceived as such by their less fortunate peers. Interviewees <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>reassurance from the experiences of others, using the <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to gauge their own progress through the transition whilst accepting the uniqueness of their own <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>since '<em>everybody is so different</em>'. Participants who had experienced an early menopause whether natural or surgically-induced were particularly at risk of feeling different and isolated. The decision of how to manage symptoms provided a further example of the individual <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to the problem with some women choosing hormone replacement therapy and others turning to complementary and alternative medicine <span>approaches</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>Receiving and providing advice, information and support</h3>

<p>Evidence from the literature shows that women value informal, interpersonal sources of information and advice (e.g.,  <a href="#mea01">Meadows <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>, <a href="#ank07">Ankem 2007</a>, <a href="#ave07">Avery and Braunack-Mayer 2007</a>). Participants in the menopause study confirmed this and several explained that they relied heavily on the support of family and friends. In common with participants from other studies (<a href="#sut07">Suter <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>, <a href="#pri08">Price <em>et al.</em> 2008</a>), participants expressed a desire for reassurance that their experiences were <em>normal</em>. This validation could come from interpersonal encounters but participants also found it through hearing or <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>accounts of other women's experiences. The exchange of advice and support could be reciprocal. Women <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>out the menopause stories of others but recognized that they too had a role in providing support. Some had actively assumed this role through involvement in support networks (an online early-menopause forum) or by becoming known as an <em>expert</em> in their social <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and passing on information to friends. Interviewees revealed a mesh of interwoven encounters with information sources that could take place over several years, as their symptoms and personal situations changed and as they <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to compare and confirm information (especially in the light of frequent and widely-reported developments in the debate about the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy). They displayed both active and passive information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>as they monitored the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>for relevant information and then contacted health- or alternative medicine-professionals for specific advice as needed.</p> 

<h3>Challenges in encounters with information and support</h3>

<p>Participants stated that they often ended up feeling as though they were '<em>running round in circles</em>' and that they struggled to get the help they needed. Although some women reported good relations with health care professionals many felt that the health care system did not adequately meet their needs. They commented on the <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>time available in a primary-care appointment ('<em>The feeling I often have is that my problem must fit in with the five minute allocation</em>') and for this reason many commented favourably on the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>menopause clinic which provided the opportunity for a more thorough <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and for options to be discussed in full. This was viewed as <span>confirmation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that a woman's problems were being taken seriously and that she was being listened to. Some participants also felt themselves to be disadvantaged by individual healthcare professionals' <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>towards hormone replacement therapy and complementary or alternative medicine, or commented that they had received conflicting advice about therapy from different medical sources. In an <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in which women are regularly exposed to opposing views about the risks and benefits of hormone treatment and complementary medicine through the media and personal contacts, <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of consensus between medical practitioners adds to uncertainty that can <span>ultimately</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>erode confidence and trust.</p> 

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>Choosing to <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>a model in a different yet related context <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>a challenge and one for which there were few precedents and little guidance in the literature. Most of the examples of information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that emerged from the menopause study could be positioned within McKenzie's model. At times, however, the decision about <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>where to place them was not straightforward or there were differences in the amount of data that could populate categories. An example of this was the category of '<em>Non-directed monitoring</em>' in the '<em>Interaction</em>' phase of the model. McKenzie's study provided examples of <em>out of the blue</em> encounters in situations where participants were not expecting to find information (e.g., watching a parent manoeuvre a double push-chair). Interviewees found that the visibility of twins-pregnancy facilitated such encounters. In the menopause study there were hardly any examples of unexpected encounters. The fact that the menopause is less visible to the <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>world may have inhibited opportunities for observing others. Another factor may have been that the menopause is still something many women may wish to be discreet about. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>woman is therefore less likely to have opportunities for overhearing conversations about the menopause <em>out of the blue</em> (unless she is in an <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>where she would expect to find menopausal women which would then constitute an example of <em>Active scanning</em> in McKenzie's model); she is also possibly less likely to chat about her menopause to acquaintances (as <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to friends) such as, to use an example from McKenzie's study, a colleague's wife.</p>

<p>McKenzie's aim was to create a model that preserved the fluidity of women's <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with sources of information and support. The concept of fluidity was particularly strong in the accounts of menopausal women. The great value placed on by-proxy <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>for this group of women <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>beyond being told things by other people into an active exchange of information and support. Unlike McKenzie's participants, who were <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>identified as information seekers, participants in this study moved in a more complex <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in which they engaged in exchanges of <span>mutual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>support. Such exchanges could be informal, through friends, colleagues or family members, or could <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in a more structured way such as involvement in an online forum.</p> 

<p>As women's journey through the menopause progressed, they themselves became acknowledged sources of information for others. The fact that the pregnant women in McKenzie's study turned to other women for advice indicates that they in turn could have a potential role as sources of information. However. this did not appear to emerge as a strong theme from the study. This may be because of the relative rarity of twin-pregnancy which <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>opportunities for exchange of information with other pregnant women or to the fact that pregnancy is a relatively short <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of high information-seeking activity and with a high level of involvement with professional healthcare providers. It is possible that the pregnant women would be more likely to be identified as authoritative sources of information in the <span>future</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> after their babies were born when they would be perceived as women who had '<em>been through it</em>', as was the case for McKenzie herself in her <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with participants (<a href="#car01">Carey <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>).</p>

<p>In another recent study in which <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>have been applied to existing frameworks, Beverley <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#bev07">Beverley <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>) applied Moore's (<a href="#moo02">Moore 2002</a>) model of social information need and Wilson's (<a href="#wil99">Wilson 1999</a>) model of information behaviour to the information behaviour of visually-impaired people seeking health and social care information. The authors were able to build upon elements of Moore's model (ranking Moore's concept of <em>information clusters</em> by relevance to the participants in their own study) but found that the model did not account for all the intervening variables acknowledged in Wilson's model and which emerged as important in determining information behaviour among people with a <span>visual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>impairment. Veinot's (<a href="#vei09">2009</a>) study focused specifically on the concept of information exchange in everyday-life information behaviour and identified several network-mediated processes that facilitated access to HIV/AIDS information in everyday life. The author related her <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to Haythornthwaite's <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>exposure concept and to Talja and Hansen's (<a href="#tal06">2006</a>) collaborative model. Everyday-life information behaviour was found to be more voluntary and loosely coordinated than had previously been described in workplace-based studies and with a stronger affective element. Veinot <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that the concept of network-mediated <span>exposure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that emerged from the HIV/AIDS study had less in common with Haythornthwaite's concept than with other information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>such as those apparent in McKenzie's model. </p>

<p>The aim of the menopause study was to apply McKenzie's <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in a different context to <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>its transferability (rather than generalisability, as the model was based on <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>research). Therefore, a complementary approach was taken, seeking not to replicate the original study <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>but to <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>a study <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to the new context yet that would ensure that data gathered would be <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>for applying to the <span>framework</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> Applying the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to McKenzie's model demonstrated that the model is fundamentally dependable and flexible enough to permit adaptation to a different context. However, there were challenges <span>inherent</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in the process. Some were the natural result of attempting to use a researcher's model without access to her decision-making process and others stemmed from the particularities and subtleties of the change of context. J&auml;rvelin and Wilson (<a href="#jar03">2003</a>) developed a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that can be used for judging the merits of a conceptual model or assessing the relative merits of two <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>conceptual models. McKenzie's model was con0ered against J&auml;rvelin and Wilson's criteria of simplicity, <span>accuracy</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> scope, systematic power, <span>explanatory</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>power, reliability, validity and fruitfulness, but using appropriate <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>validity criteria (<a href="#lin85">Lincoln and <span>Guba</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>1985</a>): credibility, transferability, dependability, confirmability. </p>

<p>McKenzie's model is simple in <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and easy to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in the context of her own research but attempting to fit examples from a different context was more complex than anticipated. The model's scope was narrow, as was the menopause study scope, but applying the model in a wider <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>should broaden the scope over time. The inclusion of the concept of <em>interaction</em> permits the discussion to <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>beyond information seeking and <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>into what happens once <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of information has been initiated. McKenzie's concept of 'interaction' did not completely meet the needs of the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>from the menopause study. There is little scope in the model for the idea of women mutually exchanging information or of becoming themselves sources of information and advice which emerged from this study. The model is therefore mostly dependable (reliable) and credible (valid) in that it can be reasonably successfully applied to results from a study in a similar context and undertaken from a similar standpoint, but it does not take account of the full <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of possible situations when presented with a different set of data.</p> 
 
<p>McKenzie deliberately avoided a <span>linear</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>representation of a systematic <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>process with the associated implications of a logical progression and <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to develop a flexible model that would preserve the fluidity of the information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>described but that would systematically describe the <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and the process. The simplicity of the model enhances its <span>explanatory</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>power, yet attempts to apply data from a different context revealed that it is not easy to predict how data from a different study would fit within it. There are some <span>difficulties</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> therefore, in the confirmability of the model's concepts. J&auml;rvelin and Wilson's final requirement for a successful conceptual model is fruitfulness by which they <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that such a model should be able to <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>problems for <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and hypotheses for <span>testing</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> In the context of the data from the menopause, it is the areas that did not fit so comfortably with the model that would best <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>problems to be <span>investigated</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>It would potentially have been simpler to take the data from the menopause study and create a new model to fit those data neatly, rather than face the challenges of applying them to an existing model. Likewise it would have been easier to <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>the interview guide without the need to take a stand on whether to base it on McKenzie's interview guide. However, the research base would not benefit from another model based on a single small-scale study. Established models should be tested and built upon to develop meaningful <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that are robust enough to be transferred across <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>2 therefore presents a version of the McKenzie model of information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in everyday life information seeking <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to allow for the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>from the menopause transition study. The original model acknowledges that the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information encounter and what happens within it is as important as the initial connection with a <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>model takes account of what happens to the information after it is <span>acquired</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> i.e. how it is used. It also takes account of the dual role of the individual who may in turn become a provider of information. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>further change to the original model is the acknowledgement that not all barriers may be successfully negotiated, for example, women from the menopause study had questions about hormone replacement therapy that could not be resolved because medical science is not yet able to provide the answers. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Applying the model of information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in everyday life information seeking in a different context has demonstrated that there is value in the <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of models. The model was sufficiently transferable and flexible to permit adaptation to a different context. However, there were elements of the new context that provided a richer and deeper interpretation of the categories within the model and suggested ways in which it could be <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>(i.e. by <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>account of women's more complex relationship with information in which they themselves may become sources of advice and by adding further depth to McKenzie's <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of barriers and counter-strategies). Further <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in a different context again, perhaps unrelated to women's health, should provide further insights into how the model could be consolidated and <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>towards the development of a more generic model of everyday information practice. Given the <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>precedence, there is currently little guidance for a researcher attempting to <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>an existing model. It is hoped that discussion of the challenges faced in this study will help <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>researchers wishing to attempt the process.</p>

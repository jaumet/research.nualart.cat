<h2>Introduction and background</h2> 
 
<p>Over the last decade, government at all levels in the United Kingdom has recognised a need for enhanced dialogue between policy makers and stakeholders during the policy making process. This has the result of number of factors, including the previous Labour Government's Modernising Government agenda, with its commitment to '<em>consult <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>experts, those who implement policy and those affected by it early in the process</em>' (<a href="#cab99">Cabinet Office 1999</a>: 16), and the devolution of certain legislative <span>powers</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>from <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>government in London to three new <span>bodies</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> the Scottish Parliament, the National <span>Assembly</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>for Wales, and the Northern Ireland <span>Assembly</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> in the <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>1990s.</p>
 
<p>The number of government consultation exercises conducted each year in the UK remains consistently high, and, in the case of the devolved legislatures, would appear to be rising. For example, the Cabinet Office (<a href="#cab07">2007</a>) notes that the UK Government and its agencies currently launch around 600 consultations each year (although Jones and Ashton (<a href="#jon06">2006</a>) estimate the annual number to be over 1,000). While Halpin and Baxter (<a href="#hal08a">2008a</a>) found that the average number of consultation exercises conducted annually by the Scottish Government (129) is approximately 34% greater than the number (96) carried out by its predecessor, the Scottish Office, immediately before devolution.</p> 
 
<p>The extent of this activity comes at a significant cost, with estimates of &pound;100 million annual spend and up to 10,000 public sector staff spending a significant proportion of their time in organizing public consultations (<a href="#jon04">Jones and Gammell 2004</a>). This <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>seems set to continue with the UK Government's 2008 commitment to '<em>effective consultation; consultation which is targeted at, and <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>accessible to, those with a clear interest in the policy in question</em>' (<a href="#bet08">Better Regulation Executive 2008</a>: 3). The Scottish Government (<a href="#sg08">2008</a>: 8) has also affirmed recently that '<em>the consultation process remains fundamental to good government</em>', emphasising the need for consultations to be open, inclusive and transparent.</p> 

<p>Despite the importance of this dialogue between policy makers and interested parties, very little has been written on the information management and communication issues surrounding government consultations in the UK. While several commentators have <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to information provision <i>en passant</i> (e.g.,  <a href="#coo02">Cook 2002</a>, <a href="#scf02">Scottish Civic Forum 2002</a>, <a href="#jon04">Jones and Gammell 2004</a>, <a href="#bart07">Bartram 2007</a>, <a href="#con07">Consultation Institute 2007</a>), there have been no large-scale, systematic studies of UK consultation information issues and, indeed, little research into the <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of the UK consultative process more broadly, a fact bemoaned in a literature review conducted on behalf of the Scottish Executive:</p> 

<blockquote>'The rapid <span>rise</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in use of this traditional and well <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>approach particularly by <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>government since devolution demands a body of evaluative critique in order to ensure that best practice is being identified and <span>followed</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> However, such material appears not to exist...' (<a href="#nic05a">Nicholson 2005a: 24</a>)</blockquote>

<p>This paper, which reports the results of a study which <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the information behaviour of a <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of  groups in the Scottish public policy arena, is therefore particularly important and timely. In many respects, it complements a recent paper by one of the authors (<a href="#bax09">Baxter 2009</a>) which examined, from the policy maker's (i.e., the Scottish Government's) <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> the provision and communication of information during the consultation process. Both papers follow an earlier project, funded by the UK's Economic and <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>Research Council (ESRC), which <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the mobilisation of group interests in the Scottish policy making process ('The mobilisation of organized interests in policy making: access, activity and bias in the &quot;group system&quot;', RES-000-22-1932, headed by <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>Darren Halpin).</p> 


<h3>What is meant by 'consultation'?</h3> 

<p>The Scottish Government defines consultation as</p> 

<blockquote>a time <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>exercise when we provide specific opportunities for all those who wish to <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>their opinions on a proposed area of our work (such as identifying issues, developing or changing policies, <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>proposals or evaluating provision) to do so in ways which will inform and enhance that work (<a href="#sg08">Scottish Government 2008</a>: 6).</blockquote> 

<p>In terms of policy-related purpose, a variety of types of consultation exist: some elicit opinions on very broad conceptual policy developments, others on specific draft legislation, proposed amendments to existing legislation, or the <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of European Union Directives into national or devolved legislative frameworks.</p> 

<p>In terms of methods, the traditional approach across all levels of government in the UK has been to conduct a written consultation exercise, where a paper, detailing the policy issue(s) being con0ered, is circulated to interested parties and written responses are invited. It is <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>fair to say that the written consultation is still the mainstay of the Scottish Government's consultative process; although, increasingly, this can be supplemented with face-to-face methods, such as public meetings and seminars, or with more deliberative methods, such as citizens' juries or deliberative polling (<a href="#nic05b">Nicolson 2005b</a>).  Although the majority of consultations attract relatively modest numbers of respondents (50-60), when a <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>captures the imagination of the public then participation can be <span>extensive</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> In 2004, for instance, a Scottish Government consultation on smoking in public places received over 53,000 responses; while a 2008 consultation on a proposed Scottish Climate Change Bill had over 21,000 respondents.</p> 

<h2>Method</h2> 

<p>This research was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to explore the information behaviour of representative groups in responding to Scottish Government consultations. Its objectives were to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>(1) how groups find out about relevant consultations to which they might wish to contribute, (2) how they go about gathering information in preparation for submitting a <span>response</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> and (3) how they find out about the results of consultations to which they have contributed.</p> 

<p>The rationale for the study evolved from the earlier ESRC project, where the researchers compiled a dataset representing over 185,000 written responses from almost 19,000 different organizations (plus thousands of individual citizens) to almost 1,700 Scottish Government consultations conducted between 1982 and May 2007. Subsequently, a questionnaire-based <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of 469 non-governmental organizations known to have responded to at least one Scottish Government consultation during the post-devolution <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>was conducted. That <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>gathered data on the structure, membership and policy activities of these organizations, and included some basic, closed questions on sources of consultation information and on the information-gathering process when preparing a consultation <span>response</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> It <span>established</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> for example, that organizations learn about consultations through a wide <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of channels, and that the majority of organizations (73%) gather information of some kind in preparation for a consultation <span>response</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> usually (i.e., in 69% of organizations) <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>some consultation with all, or a <span>segment</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> of their membership. The <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>also highlighted organizations' <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>about the effectiveness of the consultation process, particularly in terms of <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>what, if any, impact consultation responses have on the eventual policy decisions (<a href="#hal08b">Halpin and Baxter 2008b</a>).</p> 

<p>This study, therefore, <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to explore these issues in more detail, by means of semi-structured telephone interviews with representatives of a <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of those organizations that had completed the postal <span>survey</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> In choosing semi-structured interviews as the data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>method, the researchers aimed to elicit richer, more <span>detailed</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>data on organizational information behaviour than might be obtained from, say, another questionnaire-based <span>survey</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 

<p>The original <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>had included an appeal for potential interviewees, and it was from this 'pool' of volunteer organizations that the current study <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>was <span>drawn</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>total of fifty-two interviews was conducted between August and November 2009, while a further two organizations requested a copy of the interview schedule and submitted their responses by e-mail. The study, therefore, includes data from fifty-four groups. All interviews were conducted with the individual responsible for preparing or coordinating their organization's responses to consultations, and therefore particularly well placed to provide meaningful data. The interviews, which ranged in <span>length</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>from twenty minutes to over one hour, were recorded digitally and subsequently transcribed. These transcripts were then analysed to identify the important themes and issues emerging.</p> 

<p>As Table 1 illustrates, the largest proportion (61%) of participants were 'citizen groups', that is groups that comprise and/or <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>particular marginalised <span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>(such as ethnic minorities or the homeless) or individuals with specific medical conditions (e.g., <span>mental</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>health or <span>visual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>difficulties); or who have an interest in, or campaign on, specific issues (e.g., animal welfare or the environment). Eight of the groups were professional associations, representing, for example, individuals in the legal and health care professions; while a similar number were collective <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations. Four organizations were service charities, while one trade union also participated. As the researchers were reliant on volunteer organizations self-selecting, no systematic efforts were made to ensure a representative <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in terms of organization type. However, as Table 1 indicates, the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>is relatively representative of the relevant population, i.e., of the 4,168 non-governmental organizations who had responded to at least one Scottish Government consultation in the post-devolution <span>period</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>With <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to the frequency of consultation participation, one of the organizations, a professional association, had responded to over 200 during the eight-year <span>period</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> while another professional association had made over ninety <span>contributions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Two-thirds of the groups were occasional participants, averaging one or two responses each year; while twelve (22%) of the organizations had responded just once in the post-devolution <span>period</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> 'One-off' respondents are far from unusual: indeed, 57% of the almost 19,000 organizations in the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>ESRC project dataset had responded just once over the twenty-five-year <span>period</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 
 
<h2>Political engagement</h2> 

<p>Although the ESRC project <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>had gathered data on policy activities, it did not explicitly ask organizations whether they regarded themselves as politically engaged. The first interview questions, therefore, explored these <span>perceptions</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Most (43; 80%) indicated that they would describe themselves as politically engaged organizations, who, for example, campaign, lobby, and communicate regularly with elected members and public servants. All were at pains, however, to point out that they have no political party affiliations. The vast majority (49; 91%) also indicated that one of their aims is to influence or affect public policy in some way. Given the variety of organizational types in the <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> their policy interests vary widely, from accessible transport to animal welfare. Fourteen of the groups are, or have recently been, members of Scottish Government interested party groups, Scottish Parliament cross-party groups, or other government-led forums. The <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> then, is one that largely regards itself as active and engaged in political and policy processes.</p> 

<p>When asked if they regarded their organization as proactive or reactive, in terms of policy activity, 42 (78%) <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>it to be a mixture of the two. They can be proactive, in terms of lobbying or campaigning on specific issues; and reactive when, say, responding to consultations or invitations to provide evidence to parliamentary committees. Most of the organizations have aspirations to be more proactive, but a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of resources precludes this.</p> 

<p>Fourteen of the organizations employ a full-time or part-time policy officer. Unsurprisingly, these tend to be located in the <span>larger</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> wealthier organizations: ten of the fourteen have an annual income in excess of &pound;0.5M. In four of these groups, the role combines 'policy' and 'research' duties; while in five groups, the policy officer serves the organization at a UK level. In the remaining forty organizations, policy activities (including consultation responses) are coordinated and conducted by individual members of staff or volunteers as part of a wider role.</p> 
 
<h2>Finding out about policy issues</h2> 

<p>The interviewees were asked how they find out about policy issues of relevance to their organization, and various sources were cited (see Table 3).</p>

</table> 



<p>As can be seen, two-thirds (36) of the organizations can find out from other groups, or through networks or umbrella <span>bodies</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of which they form part. They might hear through word of mouth at meetings and other events, or through hard copy or electronic newsletters and bulletins. Just under half (26) of the groups can find out through government or parliamentary sources, again by word of mouth from politicians or civil servants with whom they have close <span>links</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> or through official bulletins and alerting services. At a more proactive level, just five organizations regularly monitor government or parliamentary Websites for information on broad policy issues (but see also the section on consultations specifically below).</p> 

<p>Just 17 (31%) of the organizations use the media as a policy information <span>source</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> with <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of these employing a systematic approach to <em>trawling</em> newspapers on a <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>basis. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>number of respondents noted that they usually find out about policy developments long before they appear in the media:</p> 

<blockquote>Occasionally we hear through the media. But if it gets so far that it made it to the media, and we didn't know about it, we'd be a bit embarrassed by that.</blockquote>

<h2>Finding out about Scottish Government consultations</h2> 

<p>The organizations were then asked how they tend to find out about Scottish Government consultations more specifically (see Table 3 also). Traditionally, government <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the UK has placed an <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>on the use of consultation <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>lists, where the various departments within the national and devolved legislatures <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>lists of relevant stakeholders to whom they routinely distribute copies of consultation papers and invite responses. This approach has its critics, who <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that it results in the "same faces" continually being consulted, leading to unrepresentative responses (e.g.,  <a href="#coo02">Cook	2002</a>). Others, however, feel that <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>lists are far from being 'closed shops': Grant (<a href="#gra04">2004</a>), for instance, <span>believes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that inclusion in a <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in the UK has become relatively easy for any organization, particularly under the previous Labour government. Baxter (<a href="#bax09">2009</a>) certainly found that, within the Scottish Government, the average number of invited organizations per consultation had risen from 126 pre-devolution, to 217 post-devolution. However, there was also evidence that this increase was due less to the incremental <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of standard <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>lists, but more to the production of lengthy lists compiled specifically for particular consultations: for example, a consultation on the regulation of skin piercing being distributed to dozens of acupuncture, tattooing and body piercing businesses across Scotland. It is also worthwhile noting here that both Baxter (<a href="#bax09">2009</a>) and Barnett (<a href="#barn07">2007</a>) have identified that only around 20-22% of organizations accept a <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>invitation from government to comment on consultation papers.</p> 

<p>The majority (47; 87%) of the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations had received at least one <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>invitation to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to a consultation in recent years. Just over half (25) of these organizations <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>confident that they were regularly receiving invitations to all or most of the Scottish Government consultations relevant to their own interests:</p> 

<blockquote>Anything that's to do with our interests, <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and skills, we get invited.</blockquote>

<p>However, the others expressed some doubts as to the logic and consistency of the <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>lists system:</p> 

<blockquote>We also get sent some. But how and who decides which ones we get sent, and who sends them, I have no idea.</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, there were some real <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and frustrations expressed over idiosyncratic invitation <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> For example, one botanical group was surprised that a consultation on invasive plant and animal <span>species</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>had been sent to a tennis club, but not to themselves. While a support group for young, homeless women, expressed its disbelief at not being invited <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to participate in a consultation on prostitution, whilst, at the same time, receiving invitations to comment on consultations on <span>dog</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>fouling and on an Aquaculture and Fisheries Bill.</p> 

<p>Clearly, the reasoning behind <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>compilation <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>further <span>investigation</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> In the original ESRC project it had been hoped to <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>this with civil servants responsible for consultations, but gaining access to these officials <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>difficult. At the time of <span>writing</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> however, the researchers, after <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>with the Scottish Government, are about to begin a series of in-depth interviews with officials, which will <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>these and other issues surrounding the consultation process.</p> 

<p>In addition to maintaining departmental <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>lists, the Scottish Government has an e-mail notification service, seConsult, which provides weekly updates on new and forthcoming consultation exercises. When seConsult was launched, the then Scottish Executive emphasised that it was aimed at complementing and not replacing <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>lists, and that it was hoped that it would   '<em>bring new voices into the policy arena</em>' (<a href="#se04">Scottish Executive 2004</a>). Despite seConsult now having over 8,000 subscribers, there is little evidence that this has happened. Baxter (<a href="#bax09">2009</a>) <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that the overall proportion of responses coming from organizations not invited through <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>lists had remained relatively <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>since the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of seConsult, suggesting that most subscribers are <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>already on <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>lists. This would certainly appear to be the case in the current sample: twenty-five (46%) of the organizations subscribe to seConsult  and twenty-one of these have also <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>on a <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of some kind. However, <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>half of the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations were completely unaware of the existence of seConsult, suggesting that the Scottish Government <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to undertake more effective awareness-raising work, aimed both at organizations already on <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>lists, as well as potential '<em>new voices</em>' yet to participate in any consultation.</p> 

<p>On a more proactive basis, fifteen (28%) of the organizations regularly monitor the content of the Consultations pages on the Scottish Government Website, looking for potential items of interest. These pages provide <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of, and access to, the majority of forthcoming and current consultations, and their content is closely linked, through a content management system, to the seConsult system. This connection appears to be <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>on some organizations in the <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> as eight of the fifteen who regularly monitor the site also receive the seConsult e-mail alerts.</p> 

<p>Interestingly, eight of the organizations occasionally find out about consultations some time before they are launched, when they are called upon by Scottish Government officials to participate in a pre-consultation stage. Here, the organizations assist in the development of a consultation document before it is distributed more widely: to '<em>run things by us</em>',  as one group put it, '<em>to get a fair idea if we're going to object to something</em>'.  Six of these eight groups are also members of the government- and parliament-led forums mentioned earlier and might, therefore, be  regarded as what Grant (<a href="#gra04">2004</a>: 408) describes as '<em>in0er groups</em>'. They would certainly appear to meet Grant's criteria, in that they have been granted legitimacy by the Scottish Government and have become involved in a further, more informal level of consultation than most organizations.</p> 

<p>The other relatively significant sources of consultation information are other groups, networks and umbrella <span>bodies</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Eighteen (33%) of the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations have heard of forthcoming and current consultations through such sources, either by word of mouth or through newsletters and bulletins.</p> 

<p>The media, on the other hand, play little part in organizations <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>out about consultations: only one of the fifty-four groups cited the media as an information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> This is perhaps unsurprising. Although the Scottish Government's internal good practice guidance (<a href="#sg08">2008: 32</a>) suggests that '<em>most consultations are given a press launch and/or press release</em>', this is far from being the case: between 2007 and 2009 just 18% of consultation launches were <span>accompanied</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>by a press release (<a href="#bax09">Baxter 2009</a>). Indeed, it is fair to say that the majority of Scottish Government consultations receive little or no media coverage. Many are on very specific, technical issues relating to particular industries and it is questionable that the media and the public at large would find a consultation on, say, seed potatoes regulations, particularly newsworthy. There are occasions, however, when the issue under consultation does capture the <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of the media (for example, in <a href="#sco">2006</a>, the <em>Scotsman</em> newspaper ran a campaign calling for the abolition of prescription <span>charges</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>for the chronically ill), but these are relatively few and far between.</p> 

<h2>Gathering information for a consultation response</h2> 

<p>The interviews then focused on how organizations typically go about gathering information in preparation for a consultation <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>(see Table 4). Significantly, however, two-thirds of the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>indicated that there is no <em>typical</em> way. The method might vary depending on: the subject and technicalities of the consultation; its perceived importance to, and potential impact on, the organization; the timescale available in which to respond; and the resources available within the organization at the time.</p>

<p>Twenty-four (44%) of the organizations will, at times, attempt to consult their entire membership, or as many members as possible, to feed into a <span>response</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> The ways in which they do this vary, for example: by posting <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>on members' <span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of their Websites; circulating <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>by e-mail; discussing the issue at <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>or special meetings; or, in the case of one angling club, simply chatting to members on the riverbank. Depending on the timescale and the technicalities of the consultation, the consultation document itself might be circulated to members for comment. In other cases, a summary may be circulated, or the individual responsible for coordinating the <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>may write and circulate a draft organizational <span>response</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Any comments are then collated before feeding into the final <span>response</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 

<p>Depending on the subject and complexities of the consultation, thirty-nine (72%) of the organizations will consult only with particular individuals or sub-groups within their membership <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>possess</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the necessary expertise and knowledge to provide an informed <span>response</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> For example, one citizen group which focuses on immigration issues has a small housing team, to which housing-related consultations are directed; while a trade association with transport interests circulates animal transportation consultations only to its livestock haulier members.</p> 

<p>Fourteen (26%) of the organizations can, at times, submit consultation responses after minimal or no consultation with their broader membership. In these cases, the <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>is prepared either solely by the individual with <em>consultation responsibilities</em>, or it may have input from the management team only. These tend to be for consultations regarded as '<em>peripheral</em>' or '<em>of minor relevance</em>' to the organization, or when very specific subject expertise cannot be located amongst members. In three organizations, however, the standard practice appears to be that one individual will <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>on behalf of the organization, with the <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>being based on that individual's <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of the opinions of the membership as a whole.</p> 

<p>Interestingly, fourteen (26%) of the organizations sometimes use existing, internal, <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>or <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>data to inform a consultation <span>response</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Four of these groups <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>small '<em>policy libraries</em>' or '<em>information banks</em>' of <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>data on which they can draw; while nine have their own <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>research data, which, although not collected specifically for consultations, can feed into these. These <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>data includes information from systematic reviews, surveys of members and <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of case work databases and helpline calls. Two of these organizations, however, have collected <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>data specifically for consultations: one environmental group conducted <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>groups with local re0ents for a climate change consultation; while an animal welfare group commissioned an opinion poll during a consultation on snaring.</p> 

<p>In terms of using external sources of information to assist in the <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>process, nineteen (35%) of the organizations regularly use the Web, largely to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>official statistics, government publications, or the results of research conducted by academic institutions or large voluntary <span>bodies</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> This is generally done to '<em>inform</em>' or '<em>give weight</em>' to the organizations' responses.</p> 

<p>Twenty (37%) of the organizations will, at times, consult subject experts from <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>their membership. These might be academics, colleagues in other organizations, or professionals within particular fields, such as accountants and lawyers. For example, one citizen group with learning disabilities interests, wishing to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to a consultation on fatal accident inquiry procedures, but struggling to decipher the '<em>legal jargon</em>' <span>contained</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>within the paper, obtained the assistance of a solicitor who works for another, <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>citizen group working in the learning disabilities field.</p> 

<p>Interestingly, when preparing a <span>response</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> almost <span>one-third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>(31%) of the organizations regularly exchange ideas and information with other '<em>like-minded</em>' organizations working in the same policy areas who are responding to the same consultation. This information exchange is not done in preparation for any formal joint <span>response</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> nor for any collective umbrella body <span>response</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Rather it is done to '<em>bounce things off each other</em>' and try to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>if there is a '<em>common stance</em>' or '<em>common interest</em>' that all of the organizations can include in their respective responses.</p> 

<p>The vast majority of the organizations who use external sources in preparing a <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>indicated that they do give some con0eration to assessing the information obtained from these sources. Many discussed the '<em>reliability</em>', '<em>credibility</em>', '<em>trustworthiness</em>' and '<em>reputation</em>' of their sources, and noted the importance of, as one interviewee put it, '<em>separating the polemic from the factual</em>'.  Just one group openly admitted that its <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>criterion is '<em>whether or not it backs up what you want to be saying</em>'. Without wishing to sound cynical, the authors suspect that many of the other organizations were less honest at this stage of the interviews, despite guaranteed anonymity. It is perhaps difficult to believe that, say, the single-issue citizen groups who regularly campaign and lobby always adopt an entirely objective and balanced approach in attempting to communicate their message to policy makers.</p> 

<h2>Finding out about the results of consultations</h2> 

<p>The most frequent <span>criticism</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>aimed at government consultative processes in the UK <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of feedback to respondents on the results of consultations. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>succession of commentators (e.g.,  <a href="#coo02">Cook 2002</a>, <a href="#jon04">Jones and Gammell 2004</a>, <a href="#con05">Consultation Institute 2005</a>) have highlighted the mistrust and cynicism that can develop amongst participants if consultation outcomes are not published and disseminated. In the Scottish Government <span>setting</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Baxter (<a href="#bax09">2009</a>) found that, while there has been a gradual improvement in the public availability of post-consultation feedback in the post-devolution <span>period</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> the feedback itself varies widely in terms of its <span>style</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> extent and <span>quality</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> He also found that feedback on what policy decisions have been made as a result of consultation is <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>negligible or non-existent.</p> 

<p>Baxter's study was based solely on an analysis of the contents of the <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Home" target="_blank">Scottish Government Website</a>. The final group of questions in the interviews, therefore, <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to explore the consultees' experiences in <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>out about the results of consultations to which they have contributed. The Scottish Government's internal guidance states that initial feedback should be sent to all respondents within twelve weeks of the consultation closing date, or that they should at least be directed to where feedback will be found on the Scottish Government Website. This feedback should normally take the form of an <em>Analysis Report</em>, which <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and summarises all of the views expressed in a consultation. Subsequently, all respondents should be sent, or notified of, a <em>Consultation Report</em>, which indicates and justifies what policy decisions have been made as a result of the consultation.</p> 

<p>While forty-seven (87%) of the organizations were aware of having seen some form of consultation feedback, just twenty-two <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>confident that they were always sent, or alerted to the location of, this feedback. In the other twenty-five, '<em>random</em>', '<em>variable</em>', '<em>sporadic</em>', '<em>patchy</em>' and '<em>hit-and-miss</em>' were amongst the terms used to describe the Scottish Government's dissemination efforts. Seven groups were adamant that they had never seen any feedback.</p> 

<p>Ten of the organizations regularly or occasionally <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the Scottish Government Website for consultation results; while five groups usually hear about the publication of feedback reports from other groups and networks. Four organizations claimed that the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of feedback is such, that they tend to discover the outcomes of consultations only when new legislation <span>eventually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>comes into <span>force</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Three groups, meanwhile, tend to '<em>forget</em>' about consultations once they have submitted their contribution, preferring to '<em>move on</em>' to the next policy issue of interest.</p> 

<p>In terms of the 'type' of feedback obtained, there is a clear <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>on the Analysis Report: just thirteen (24%) of the organizations have encountered a Consultation Report and most of the others <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>unaware that such a <span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of report existed. Unsurprisingly, this was regarded as a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>failing in the process:</p> 

<blockquote>I don't recall seeing an awful lot about what shaped the decision-making, which is a bugbear for me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The analysis report was very good. It did state well enough, and <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>very accurately, what they had heard from the consultation. But I thought, 'Okay, and now what are you going to do with it?' 'What's the outcome of it?'</blockquote>

<p>Twelve of the groups occasionally receive additional, personal consultation feedback from government officials. In half of these cases, the contact has been instigated by the officials, while in the others the organization has adopted a proactive approach and made a conscious effort to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>information from the relevant civil servants. This more personal approach was regarded favourably:</p> 

<blockquote>You can confer with people on a much more personal basis what you're thinking, if you're meeting them face-to-face, rather than responding to something that's 300 pages long.</blockquote>

<p>When asked if they felt that their organization's contribution to consultations was con0ered or <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in the eventual feedback, there was a generally positive response: thirty-two (59%) of the groups believe that the Scottish Government does, indeed, <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>their responses. There was an acknowledgement, however, that comments and arguments presented in the feedback could rarely be attributed <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to their own organization, because much of the results are presented anonymously (two-thirds of Scottish Government feedback <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>are anonymised (<a href="#bax09">Baxter 2009</a>)):</p> 

<blockquote>It's difficult to know because quite often what we're saying is what a lot of other people are saying as well.</blockquote>

<p>It should also be remembered that the majority of the feedback obtained by the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations has been in the form of Analysis Reports, which do not present the policy decisions taken following consultation. Those organizations who have obtained Consultation Reports are still unable to say definitively that their <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>have had any <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>impact on policy:</p> 

<blockquote>It's hard to <span>attribute</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>causality. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>lot of the things we've been saying in our responses are now being talked about at the government level. But we wouldn't want to claim that's because of us.</blockquote>

<p>A number of commentators (e.g., <a href="#gra04">Grant 2004</a>, <a href="#nic05b">Nicolson 2005a</a>) have noted a suspicion amongst consultees in some (usually small) organizations that feedback, when provided, is weighted heavily towards reflecting the opinion of the '<em>usual suspects</em>', the <span>larger</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> better-known organizations,  and that their own submissions are treated as second best, regardless of <span>substance</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>quality</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> With this in mind, the final interview question explored this suggestion. Overall, 72% of the organizations believe, or at least suspect, that some form of weighting is applied by consultation officials; although, largely because of the anonymity of most feedback, no <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>evidence was provided. Most (35) of these groups <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that the largest organizations receive preferential treatment. Opinions on the merits of this hypothetical weighting system were decidedly mixed: while some expressed <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>anger, naming particular organizations they believe to be favoured, others indicated that it was '<em>natural</em>' and '<em>understandable</em>':</p> 

<blockquote>You do find yourself up against the big boys, and their views are certainly heard, and you don't believe you get a fair crack of the whip.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It's <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>right as well, because if an organization's representing 60,000 people, its point is maybe more <span>valid</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>than one that's representing eighteen people in a street in the Gorbals [an area in Glasgow].</blockquote>

<p>The other four groups displayed a further level of cynicism by suggesting that feedback is weighted in favour of those groups supporting the Scottish Government's preferred position:</p> 

<blockquote>I'd say they're weighted towards the messages that say what the government said, and what meets the government agenda.</blockquote>

<p>On a related theme, eight organizations, who are members of umbrella <span>bodies</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> or who are themselves umbrella <span>bodies</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> discussed the relative merits of submitting a single <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>from a federation-type body, or submitting numerous individual responses from its constituent members. Some of these interviewees have received conflicting advice from consultation officials as to what, if any, weighting would be put on the respective <span>approaches</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 

<p>Clearly, then, there is a great <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of cynicism and confusion surrounding the potential weighting of consultation responses. In this respect, the Scottish Government's internal consultation guidance is not particularly informative, as the subject of the potential weighting of responses by organization size is simply not discussed. However, a supplementary internal guidance document, aimed at social researchers within the Scottish Government, suggests that '<em>it is not possible to assign greater <span>weight</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to the views of a large organization than to those of a smaller organization or an individual member of the public</em>' (<a href="#sg09">Scottish Government 2009</a>: 9).  This is certainly an issue worthy of further <span>investigation</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> and the aforementioned forthcoming interviews with Scottish Government officials will certainly explore this area in further detail.</p> 

<h2>Conclusions, recommendations and further research</h2> 

<p>In terms of <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>out about consultations, fewer than half of respondents regularly hear <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>from the Scottish Government, while others are reliant in particular on other groups and their <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of associated organizations as an information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Despite the fact that most have at some point received a <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>invitation to participate, many feel that to rely on government is not <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and that government processes for identifying and selecting participants are idiosyncratic and flawed. With these points in mind, the authors note with some interest the current development of a <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>stakeholder database which, the Scottish Government <span>believes</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> '<em>has the potential to become a vital part of increasing the professionalism of the way in which we ensure joined up working with stakeholders</em>' (<a href="#sg10">Scottish Government 2010</a>: 23). The precise structure of this database is, as yet, unclear, but the authors hope that it will be more than just an amalgamation of existing departmental lists of interested parties, as this will simply <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and perhaps exacerbate their existing limitations. Instead of relying solely upon the <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and assumptions of civil servants, as to the likely relevance and interest of particular consultations to particular organizations, the authors would recommend that the database <span>entries</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>be compiled by the organizations themselves, so that they might explicitly <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>their own policy interests and priorities. As a model, the Scottish Government might wish to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the Small Firms Consultation Database, maintained by the UK Government's Department for Business Innovation &amp; Skills, which contains <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of small businesses willing to be consulted on regulatory matters (<a href="#bis10">Great Britain... 2010</a>). The application form for inclusion in this database requests precise <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>on regulatory areas of interest to individual businesses, as well as on their preferred method(s) of participation in the consultation process (i.e., by post, telephone, e-mail, face-to-face, etc). This more targeted, tailored approach to consultation, might well be more effective than the current <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>distribution of consultation <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>which, as has been seen, are ignored completely by around 80% of recipients.</p> 

<p>In terms of gathering data, a broad <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of behaviour was <span>observed</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> from the wide seeking of views to cases where the individual receiving the invitation replied based on their own 'understanding' of members. Interestingly, many drew on a <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of like-minded organizations as a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of information. This wider <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>would, again, appear to be <span>influential</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>as an information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Most claim to assess the validity and credibility of data and, somewhat surprisingly, to be completely objective in the <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of data for their <span>response</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 

<p>Despite the fact that, for consultation to be embraced, participants need to feel that their responses may have been <span>influential</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> more than half of the respondents recorded some dissatisfaction with the feedback received, with <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>claiming never to have received feedback. These data would <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that, despite the importance accorded by the Scottish Government to consultation, and the very significant sums of money that continue to be expended on these exercises, there are some <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>deficiencies in the processes employed. The current authors would, therefore, make two further recommendations. Firstly, it is recommended that the provision and dissemination of post-consultation feedback to all respondents by Scottish Government officials, in the form of <em>Analysis Reports</em> and <em>Consultation Reports</em>, be made mandatory. <!-- The internal Scottish Government good practice guidance is at pains to point out that '<em>it is not <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to be prescriptive</em>', and advises officials only that feedback <i>should</i> (present authors' emphasis) be published and disseminated. --> As the interviewees' comments in this study illustrate, however, this current approach results in a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of meaningful post-consultation feedback which does little to instil or <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>participants' confidence in the consultative process.</p> 

<p>It is also recommended that quotes and comments from consultation respondents are not anonymised in post-consultation feedback reports. <!-- In this respect, the Scottish Government's current internal guidance is somewhat contradictory and without any stated rationale. On the one hand it advises civil servants to 'avoid reliance on quotations from a few particular respondents', presumably to avoid any accusations of favouring these organizations. Yet, it also advises that <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>quotations should be attributed only to the type of organization, and not to any named organization. --> This latter piece of advice is surprising, for, unlike most UK <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>government departments, the Scottish Government has a policy of making all consultation responses, as well as the <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and addresses of the respondents, publicly available on the Scottish Government Website, unless the respondents request otherwise. As Halpin and Baxter (<a href="#hal08a">2008a</a>) have <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that less than 2% of all consultation respondents decide to remain anonymous, the reasoning behind the need for anonymity in feedback reports is unclear. Indeed, the present authors would argue that, to the already sceptical reader, this apparent <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of openness and transparency in feedback reports, in not providing specific <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>on the origins of quotes and comments, will simply add fuel to the suspicions that the feedback is weighted towards reflecting the opinion of the <em>usual suspects</em>.</p> 

<p>In con0ering the results of this study of information behaviour amongst representative groups, the researchers identified two sets of <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>which might be applied to the groups. The majority of organizations con0ered themselves politically engaged and seeking to impact upon policy making, if not politically affiliated. The first set of (four) <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>were then assumed to be those that demonstrate political connection or in0er <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>(see <a href="#gra04">Grant 2004</a>), such as involvement in official fora and pre-consultation. <!-- However, as the researchers' interest related to information behaviour, they mapped, from the interviews, a second set of twelve <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>around the information activity of the respondents, which has been termed 'informedness'.  -->These twelve <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>are based on the groups' awareness of consultations, their use of various sources to inform responses, and the regularity with which they <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>feedback. The results were analysed to determine the extent of in0er <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and informedness of each of the groups, as the researchers had hypothesised that there would be a relationship between the two.</p> 

<p>However, as can be seen from the scatterplot at <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>1, there is a weak correlation (<i>r</i> = 0.25) between the two sets of <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>within this sample: 'in0er' groups do not always rate highly in terms of informedness; while many of the organizations most active in seeking information display few, if any, <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of 'in0ers'. While proving a negative may not appear initially to be interesting, it does raise further potentially valuable avenues for exploration. For example, do powerful in0er groups feel less need to seek additional information? Do those that do not have in0er <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>seek to remedy their limitations by engaging more actively in information seeking? Does informedness confer power in this context? This is an area that <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>more <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>exploration. In particular, there is a need to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the respective influences of consultees' informedness and in0er <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>on the effectiveness of engagement in the Scottish Government's policy making process. </p>

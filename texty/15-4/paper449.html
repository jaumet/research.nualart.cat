<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This paper reports on a case study that, in the  course of exploring 
the metacognitive thinking and associated emotions of ten  adolescents 
during the information search process, uncovered a social aspect to  
metacognitive knowledge. The study was framed by Kuhlthau's information 
search  process model (<a href="#kuh">1991, 2004</a>) and the construct of metacognition (<a href="#fla">Flavell  1979</a>).  Using naturalistic methods the study found, first, that talk was
used as a metacognitive strategy, as a means to help information 
seekers  understand their thinking about their own thinking, and 
secondly, the <em>talk</em> strategy was more likely to be implemented face-to-face with trusted family and  friends, rather than with the class teacher 
and school librarian or even through social  media. This metacognitive 
strategy has been labelled <em>Communicating</em> and is one part of a 
larger taxonomy of adolescent  metacognitive knowledge to emerge from 
the study (Readers wishing to learn more  about the other thirteen attributes 
can refer to Bowler (<a href="#bow">2010</a>). </p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Metacognition and metacognitive knowledge</h3>

<p>Metacognition is deliberate, planful,  intentional, goal-directed, 
future-oriented mental behavior that can be used to  accomplish 
cognitive tasks (<a href="#fla">Flavell 1979</a>). Metacognition is 
'<em>knowledge of one's  knowledge, processes, and cognitive and affective 
states; and the ability to  consciously and deliberately monitor and 
regulate one's knowledge, processes,  and cognitive and affective 
states</em>' (<a href="#hac">Hacker 1998: 11</a>). Much of the foundational  
research on metacognition has been in the area of children and 
education,  specifically in reading, writing, studying, mathematics and science
 (see, for example,  <a href="#bbr">Baker and Brown 1984</a>; <a href="#for">Forrest-Pressley and Waller 1984</a>; <a href="#gar">Garner 1987</a>; <a href="#par">Paris <em>et al</em> 1991</a>; <a href="#van">Van Hanaghan and Baker 1989</a>;  <a href="#sca">Scardamalia and Bereiter 1985</a>; <a href="#bak">Baker 1991</a>, as cited in <a href="#cer">Baker and Cerro 1996: 99</a>).</p>

<p>There are two aspects  to metacognition: <em>control processes</em> and <em>metacognitive knowledge</em> (<a href="#fla">Flavell 1979</a>;  <a href="#gar">Garner 1987</a>; <a href="#moo">Moore 1995</a>; <a href="#cer">Baker and Cerro 1996</a>; <a href="#and">Anderson and Krathwohl 2001</a>). The  first half, <em>control processes</em>,  relates  to executive control, self-monitoring and self-regulation, and
 reflects the  application of strategies to control and coordinate aspects of metacognitive  knowledge,  the actual <em>doing</em> (<a href="#bro">Brown 1987</a>; <a href="#moo">Moore 1995: 4</a>; <a href="#hac">Hacker <em>et al </em>1998</a>). The latter half of the  equation, <em>metacognitive knowledge</em>, is  concerned with the contents of knowledge, the <em>knowing that</em> 
certain  strategies work better than others or <em>knowing that</em> certain 
tasks might be  easier to perform. This study focused on the <em>knowledge</em> half of metacognition,  <em>metacognitive knowledge</em>, aiming to explore the nature of  adolescents' awareness of their own  thoughts and feelings, as well as their  awareness of cognitive  strategies and the nature of the tasks to be tackled  within the specific phenomenon of the search process. </p>

<p>Metacognitive  knowledge consists of three interrelated components: <em>self-knowledge</em>
 (awareness of one's own cognition, including  knowledge of one's 
strengths and weaknesses and the awareness of one's  motivational 
beliefs); <em>task knowledge</em> (knowledge about the cognitive demands of the task); and <em>strategic knowledge</em> (procedural knowledge of cognitive strategies  to employ when unsuccessful) (<a href="#fla">Flavell 1979</a>, <a href="#gaa">Garner and Alexander 1989</a>, <a href="#pin">Pintrich <em>et al</em> 1996</a>, <a href="#and">Anderson and Krathwohl  2001</a>).
 An example of strategic metacognitive knowledge was seen in this study,
  when the participants actively and consciously used talk to regulate 
their own  thinking processes. They knew, first of all, that the 
cognitive task required  some dialogue, and secondly, they knew <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> to put that dialogue in service  to their own cognition. </p>

<h3>Social  aspects of information seeking</h3>

<p>The  social aspects of information seeking have not gone unnoticed in
 the field of information science. The role of information 
gatekeepers, people who  control the flow of information through 
communication networks, has been  actively studied for several decades 
(for a recent review of the literature on  gatekeeping see <a href="#lu">Lu 2007</a>). In the area of youth information seeking behaviour,  <a href="#dre">Dresang (1999)</a>
 proposed the adoption of a broader research paradigm that  stretches 
beyond the walls of the physical library to include the internet and  
other every day settings in order to be able to investigate the social 
and collaborative  ways that young people find, interpret, and use 
information. </p>

<p>Research  in the realm of school libraries has shown that young 
people do turn to the  people in their lives for help with school-based 
information problems, even  when there is access to the internet. In an 
early study of high school students'  use of the world wide web for 
school assignments, most students identified the  librarian as a person 
they talked to (a claim the author questioned, saying  that the students
 knew the researcher was a librarian) as well as friends and  family 
members (<a href="#lor">Lorenzen 2001</a>). The study by Williamson <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#wil">2007</a>)
  into the seeking  and use of information by secondary students in
 Australia confirmed that  students turn to a range of people for help 
with information problems. Despite high  levels of confidence in their 
own information seeking skills, many students in this  study admitted to
 having consulted with another person for help. These people ranged  
from teachers, the librarian, other students, and in some cases, family 
members.</p>

<p>A  renewed interest in informal information seeking, more recently 
referred to as <em>everyday life information seeking</em>, that is, information-seeking 
for non-work or  non-school-related purposes, has resulted in study 
into how information  seekers use people as information mediators and 
information sources in their  everyday lives (see for example, <a href="#mck">McKenzie 2003</a>, <a href="#sav">Savolainen 1995</a>, <a href="#spi">Spink and Cole  2001</a>).
 A few studies have looked at the social aspects of adolescent  
information seeking. One such study looked at how twenty-eight adolescent girls 
found  information solutions to their everyday life concerns related to 
relationships,  education and work, turning not to libraries but to the 
people around them;  family, friends and teachers (<a href="#pos">Poston-Anderson and Edwards 1993</a>). Looking  further at how adolescent girls seek information about jobs and education, Edwards and Poston-Anderson (<a href="#edw">1996</a>)
 found that girls tended to approach their  mothers and fathers before 
teachers, career counsellors, and librarians. Shenton  and Dixon (<a href="#she">2003</a>)
 also looked at young people, aged 4 to 18, and their use of  other 
people as an information-seeking method. They found this strategy to be a
  frequently employed and highly successful  method by which youngsters 
obtain information. Julien (<a href="#jul">2004</a>) explored  
adolescents' decision-making for careers and found that they relied 
heavily on  people they trusted rather than on documentary sources.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>The case study used  naturalistic research methods to investigate the
 metacognitive knowledge of ten  adolescents, aged 16 to 18, as they 
searched for, selected, and used  information for a school-based inquiry
 project. The primary question guiding  this research was: <em>What is the role of  metacognitive knowledge during the information search process of adolescents?</em> Methods used in the study are described  below. </p>

<h3>The setting</h3>

<p>The study took place  in Montreal, Canada, at an English-language, 
junior college, commonly called a  CEGEP. The acronym CEGEP stands for 
<em>Collège  d'enseignement général et professionnel</em> or, 'College of 
General  and Professional Education'. New students are, in a 
sense, a <em>tabula rasa</em> and, at 
least in terms of library experience, they may have little else to  
guide them but their metacognitive knowledge.  The position of 
teacher-librarian does not exist in public high schools  and most 
private high schools in Montreal, and therefore information skills  
instruction at the high school level is limited to what students learn 
from the  class room teacher. </p>

<h3>The  participants</h3>

<p>A specific class, History of Western Civilization, was
 selected as the field site. The class had a full  term research project
 as its major component, which would allow for an in-depth  exploration 
of the search process over the course of five months. While the  
specific course was selected purposefully, few constraints were set on 
the individual  characteristics of participants drawn from these 
classes. In other words, the  study was open to any student in the class
 wishing to participate. All  volunteers were accepted, irrespective of 
gender, language or ethnicity, or of  the number of volunteers. 
Ultimately, ten adolescents, aged 16 to 18,  participated in the study. 
They were all in their first term, having  graduated from high 
school the previous year and, therefore, were all new to the  school. All
 of the participants were academic achievers, having been accepted  to a
 specialized <em>Arts and Sciences</em> programme at the College. </p>
 
 <h3>The information-seeking task</h3>
 
<p>The participants were asked to  write a seven- to eight-page 
argumentative essay exploring continuity and  change in western 
civilization, on a topic of their choice. To do so, they  searched for, 
selected, evaluated, and used information from a variety of  sources 
over the course of the fall 2006 term. The search process was a  
critical element to the success of the assignment because the students 
were to  use information sources to defend their position. The class had
 an assigned  text book but it was not to be included in the list of 
sources for the research  paper. The students were first asked to 
identify a topic and to locate it  within a specific geographic location
 and time frame. No specific guidelines or  boundaries as regards the 
topic were provided, as long as it was related to the  history of 
western civilization. As a result, the participants investigated  a 
wide array of topics, from Greek architecture to classical music.</p>

<h3>Data  collection protocols</h3>

<p>The study used a combination of <em>think aloud</em> and <em>think after</em>
 verbal protocols in order to provide as many venues as  possible for 
the expression of thoughts, feelings and actions experienced by  the 
participants during the search process. In this way, the data could be  
triangulated. Five types of data collection protocols were used in this 
study:  1) a series of three telephone interviews; 2) written and/or 
audio journals  kept by the participants over the course of the 
semester; 3) an in-person  interview immediately following the final 
submission of the essay; 4) a  visualizing exercise (a timeline) and; 5)
 a follow-up interview conducted several  months later. Metacognitive 
knowledge was specifically targeted by questions  related to <em>why</em> and probes designed to  reveal the <em>self-prompting questions</em> the
 participants may have asked themselves.  Questions related to actions 
helped to situate the participants' progress  throughout the search 
process and were the critical factor in uncovering the  different genres
 of search. </p>
 
<h3>Data analysis</h3>

<p>Analysis was inductive and grounded in the data, using the words and
 actions of the participants to tell the story  of their journey 
through the information search process. The data were transcribed and 
imported to a qualitative data analysis software application  (Atlas.ti 
5.2) and one <em>hermeneutic unit</em> was created (the <em>container</em> for all  the 
data and coding). During coding, the data were segmented 
into  meaning units at the sentence and paragraph level. Using a
 grounded  theory approach, three levels of codes were developed: <em>descriptive, interpretive</em> and <em>pattern</em> (<a href="#mil">Miles and Huberman 1994</a>: 57), each representing a progressive drilling down  through the data toward its essential themes. </p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>Because of the small  sampling size, generalizations beyond the context 
of the study are difficult to infer. The ten participants  in 
this study were high academic-achievers in a Montreal-area private 
school, and  their behaviour may not reflect that of the general 
population. Also, some  of their behaviour may have been shaped by 
the type of information task assigned by the teacher. The 
results of this study relate to a specific  content area, the history 
of western civilization, and are not generalizable  to other content 
areas or information seeking tasks. In addition, the extent of  the 
students' prior domain, information system and metacognitive knowledge, 
in  relation to other students of their age, were not known as the 
qualitative  methods to be used in this study precluded the use of a 
control group or wide  sampling procedures. Only two of the ten 
participants were male  and, therefore, the study presents 
no findings on sex differences. </p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>The study identified  thirteen attributes of adolescent metacognitive knowledge. This paper focuses on one  of them; <em>communicating</em>. This  attribute 
 is linked  to the social dimension of information seeking and involves 
the use of people  as information mediators and information sources 
during the search process.  Quite simply, it is knowing that talking to 
people is a useful cognitive  strategy. Talking to people serves many 
cognitive purposes during the search  process. <em>Talk</em> can help to 
clarify points of confusion about conflicting  information or it can 
help to unite information into a cohesive unit. <em>Talk</em>  can also be a 
quick source of information, helping to build a knowledge base,  or can 
provide a road map for the next steps in the process. While the <em>Communicating</em>
 attribute played out  throughout the information search process, it was
 predominant during the topic selection stage of Kuhlthau's information search process model 
and later, when collecting information and preparing it for 
presentation, suggesting that the participants used <em>talk</em>  in highly 
specific and strategic ways.</p>

<p>Uncertainty  may be common among young people working on their first 
research paper.  Generally, the participants in this study understood 
that they were confused  and knew that talking through the problem with a
 knowledgeable other at some  point in the process was a dependable 
cognitive strategy for clarifying  thoughts. The participants in this 
study used <em>talk</em> as a way to reach out to  people who could act as 
their information mediators. Interestingly, the role of  information 
mediator was filled by people in the participants' everyday lives;  
their parents, siblings, grandparents, neighbours and family friends,  
and not  so much by the librarian, the one person whose very job it is 
to mediate  between information and users. </p>

<p>In some ways, parents, family
 and friends were  more than just a bridge between the participants and 
the information; they were the information source. Given that 
these  conversations were conducted in the context of the participants' 
everyday lives, anywhere, anyplace, anytime, the researcher was not 
able to record the  actual words spoken between the participants and the
 people they talked to. It  is  difficult, therefore, to know where the 
mediation role ended and the  information source role began. 
Nevertheless, the participants acknowledge that they turned to people 
in their network of relationships because they knew it  was a good 
strategy for helping them to make sense of the problem. </p>

<p>Knowing  that the strategy exists, when to implement it and why, 
represents a certain  type of metacognitive knowledge. Table 1 shows who
 the participants talked to  and when. While the table provides a 
 sense of the <em>who</em> and the <em>when</em>, it does not provide a picture of the
 <em>why</em>  and <em>how</em>. The participants used <em>talk</em> to serve two very 
different purposes.  One purpose was to use people in their circle of 
family and friends as <em>information mediators</em>, people who could 
 help navigate the tangled web of information and meaning-making that 
the  participants needed negotiate, and as <em>information  sources</em>,
people whose knowledge of a topic would provide a shortcut to  actual
 information. To complete the picture, a more thorough description  
follows. This picture is framed by the six stages in the information search process.</p>

<p>During  the first stage of the information search process model, <em>task initiation</em>, 
there seemed to be no  talk about the research project, perhaps because 
this is a passive stage where  the student simply receives the 
assignment from the teacher. During <em>topic selection</em>, however, 
the  participants actively sought and enjoyed the advice of those around
 them. Three  factors seemed to drive this decision: the accessibility 
of the information  mediator, his or her expertise in the topic, and an 
interest in the  participant. For example, one participant thought she 
might want to look at the  history of western civilization through the 
lens of philosophy, but the topic  was large and needed to be narrowed 
somewhat. She began her search by going to  her mother because <em>'she was a
 person who had read philosophers'</em> and <em>'she was  there and I knew she 
would help me'</em>. Using her mother as an information  mediator offered the
 participant a quick and easy method to help clarify her  thoughts on 
the topic; a cognitive shortcut. </p>

<p> The topic of philosophy was also of  interest to another participant
 who, although he knew that he wanted to frame  the research paper 
around the broad topic of philosophy, still needed to work  out some of 
the details. Early in the search process, less than two weeks after  the
 research project had been assigned and before a specific topic had been
  chosen, this participant identified <em>talk</em> as a useful strategy. When 
asked to  complete the sentence, <em>When looking for information sometimes
 it helps to... </em>,  he replied, <em>'Ask for help'</em>. Who would he ask? <em>'The 
reference librarian. My  sister who studies philosophy at university.'</em> 
At the end of the term, the  participant represented his search process 
in a timeline and confirmed that the  search was launched by talking to 
his sister to see <em>'if the project makes  sense'</em>. Interestingly, although
 talking to the librarian was forecast as a  useful strategy, in the 
event it does not seem to have actually happened. In  any case, the 
sister filled the role of subject expert and talking to her helped  to 
provide some clarification of the topic. </p>

<p>Other  participants also shared their thoughts with family and 
friends as well. One  participant outlined his timeline early in the 
game, saying his first step was  to <em>discuss possible topic choices with
 my parents, sister and cousin for  input and ideas'</em>.  Why? 
Because <em>'I had  no ideas for topics, but knew that their suggestions 
would be original. Used  their experience in research'</em>. This  
decision was driven by the self-prompting question, identified by the  
participant in her timeline as <em>Who has experience in writing research 
papers  &amp; has a large store of knowledge to discuss with me?</em> So, in
 this case,  expertise in doing library-based research was the key, 
although a background in  the topic area also played into the decision 
to turn to others, demonstrating  that this participant recognized that 
she was weak in two areas of knowledge,  the subject domain and the 
information-seeking domain, and that interpersonal  communication with 
those who do have expertise is a useful method for filling  in the gaps 
in knowledge. </p>

<p>It is  surprising who filled the role of information mediator. In the
 case of one  participant, a neighbour stepped in to help. The 
participant, who at this point  had not made any decisions regarding the
 topic and indeed felt <em>desperate</em>  about it, turned to a neighbour who 
<em>'knows a lot about history and was always  up for a discussion'</em>. In this
 case the neighbour's expertise in history and an  openness to 
discussing it were two factors in the decision to talk about it.  
(Qualifying his understanding of the neighbour's expertise, the 
participant  later explained that the neighbour reads a lot and has a 
large home library).  Figuring he (the participant)  <em>'would be able to 
handle most topics'</em>, he chose  a topic suggested by the neighbour that 
<em>'seemed interesting'</em>. </p>

<p>As the  students moved forward in the information search process, 
family members  continued to play the role of information mediator. One 
participant was quite  clear on her topic on the history of libraries 
and so, when she turned to her  mother, whom she identified as a 
librarian at a local university, during the <em>Exploration</em> phase 
of her search, it was  to ask for her mother's help in identifying 
specific resources on the topic so  that she could narrow down the 
focus. Her mother <em>'brought the books from the  university'</em> and 
<em>'emphasized what I should look for'</em>. </p>

<p>The  mixed roles of mother and information professional raised 
ethical concerns (and  some anxiety) for this student; Was it right for
 her mother to gather the  information resources on her behalf? Was her 
mother doing her homework? This  conundrum raises an interesting 
question regarding the role of information  mediators, family or not. 
How far should a mediator go in providing  information resources for a 
student? For information seekers, knowing that a  parent with expertise 
may help to move one forward in the process by helping to  clarify the 
information or modeling good practices in information gathering may  be a
 valuable piece of metacognitive knowledge. On the other hand, it may be
  counter-productive, cognitively-speaking, with the parent carrying too
 much of  the cognitive load and doing the heavy-lifting when it comes 
to  information-gathering, thus preventing the student from learning. </p>

<p>Family  members did not provide the only counsel for these students. Moving from <em>Exploration</em> into <em>Focus Formulation</em>,
 one participant turned to three professors at  the local university, who
 were also family friends and acquaintances, after  having explored
 the literature somewhat because she '<em>was trying to make  generalities</em>' 
and <em>'there's a lot of things that aren't stated in books'</em>.  Furthermore,
<em>'articles from journals are really quite useless at my level. They  
expect you have a fountain of knowledge'</em>.  Knowing, then, that she
 lacked the requisite knowledge needed to explore  the topic further and
 arrive at some focus on the topic, she turned to people  who <em>did</em>
 have that knowledge. In one  quick stroke, the experts were able 
clarify some puzzling points the  participant had about the information. </p>
 
<p>Reaching  beyond the comfortable network of family and friends was a 
useful strategy, but  those who did it, or who at least considered it, 
also knew that they had to  know more about the topic before they 
contacted the expert so that they could  ask the right questions. In 
other words, they understood that,  cognitively-speaking, the best way 
to interact with an information mediator was  to be able to have 
something that could launch a conversation. This meant  waiting until 
the tail end of <em>Exploration</em>.  For example, one participant 
considered talking to an art history teacher at  the college but did not
 because, at that point in time, he did not <em>'feel  informed enough to 
talk to them yet'.</em> Another participant talked with three family friends
 who happened to be professors but only after doing some  pre-research 
because, as she said, she <em>'couldn't do the interviews without  looking 
through books'</em>. </p>

<p>Moving  from <em>Focus Formulation</em> to <em>Information Collection</em>,
 participants  again turned to information mediators for help. Some 
students at this point had  already begun organizing their essays into 
sections. They knew that the  information they had gathered was 
incomplete or at least, did not make sense yet,  and so they discussed 
the gaps with others. Three of these interactions  occurred with a 
parent and resulted in the collection of more information. The mother  
of one participant found a useful bibliography at the end of a fiction 
novel  she had just finished reading, a novel that happened to be on the
 same research  topic her daughter was studying (one wonders if there 
had been an earlier  conversation about this particular novel that had 
inspired the participant to  follow this topic). The participant then 
used the bibliography as a tool for  collecting in-depth information on 
the topic. A third participant found  information resources in the book 
collection housed at her mother's design firm: a lucky coincidence 
given that the student's topic was on architecture. </p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>This  study has shown that there is a social aspect to information 
seeking that  filters through even to the metacognitive level of 
thinking. Kuhlthau's ISP model  of the information search process 
identifies three parallel dimensions &#8211; cognitive,  affective and 
behavioral. The use of communication as a metacognitive strategy  during
 the information search process suggests that there is a fourth 
dimension  that is based in the social and cultural worlds of 
information seekers. Dealing  with this social dimension required a 
specific set of metacognitive strategies. </p>

<p>Given  the seemingly natural inclination of young people to turn to  
knowledgeable-others in their lives for information, it is no surprise 
that  communicating is an attribute of the metacognitive knowledge of 
the young  people in this study. What is surprising is that this social 
aspect of  metacognitive knowledge was implemented not in the context of
 everyday life but  rather, in service to a school-based, 
information-seeking task, the purpose of  which was to develop skills in
 finding and using formal documentary sources.  This seems incongruous. 
After all, why should one turn to an informal  information source when 
looking for a formal source?</p> 

<p>Perhaps the reason for  this inconsistency 
lies in the way that <em>information</em> is defined. The kind of  information 
that is used for the purposes of a school project tends to be what  
Bates (<a href="#bat">2006: 1039</a>) has called <em>exosomatic 
information</em>; that is, <em>information  that is stored externally to the 
body of animals</em> (the human being a type of  animal). This is the kind 
of information we associate with the documents in a  library or on the 
Web and it is what we train students to find. But the  students in this 
study also used a second type of information, <em>embodied  
information</em>; information that is <em>'the corporeal expression or 
manifestation  of information previously in encoded form'</em> (<a href="#bat">Bates 2006: 1035</a>).
 This is  information which is derived from a document and then 
expressed orally through  language. Perhaps there is a need to broaden 
the set of information-seeking  skills taught at school, providing the 
necessary tools needed to handle and,  indeed, take advantage of, 
<em>embodied information</em>. Perhaps it is the case that  
metacognitively-aware information seekers deliberately go beyond the  
traditional boundaries of information, the <em>exosomatic</em>, and seek help
 in  other realms of information. </p>
 
<p>A  re-configuration of our conception of <em>information seeking</em> may be
 needed to  take account of this behaviour in the training that young 
people receive vis-&agrave;-vis the information search process. When 
librarians think of the traditional  research essay, they often 
interpret <em>research</em> to mean <em>finding a document</em>:  a Web page, a 
journal article or a chapter in a book, which is hidden  somewhere 
inside an information system; a database, a library catalogue, a Web  
portal, a search engine or a book. In direct contrast to this view, the 
 participants in this study cast a much wider net and used the people in
 their  world as information sources. Although one participant wondered 
about the  reliability of her mother as an information source, most 
trusted their family  and friends unquestioningly. It was a natural step
 for them and in  metacognitive terms, perhaps the easiest step. As a 
metacognitive strategy, it  was a move that paid off well because it 
lightened the cognitive load needed to  find sources and helped them 
move forward in their search faster. </p>

<p>While  the participants in this study used people as information 
sources, they equally  used them as information mediators, that is, 
someone who provides a link  between the information and the consumer of
 that information. The links were  mediated by dialogue but the 
dialogue rarely occurred with the librarian.  Perhaps this was due 
simply to the accessibility of family and friends. Or it  could be due 
to a misalignment in the type of social interaction that the  
participants required and the social interaction that the librarian was 
 prepared to give. The ways that librarians can intervene are many and 
one  model, created by Kuhlthau, has mapped five levels of intervention 
to the six  stages in the information search process model. They are, ranging from the lowest 
to highest level of  intervention: organizer, locator, identifier, 
advisor and counsellor (<a href="#kuh">2004</a>: 129-134).  It is at the highest levels where conversation between librarian and user helps  to clarify meaning and organize thoughts. </p>

<p>As an information mediator, the librarian in this  study functioned 
principally at the mid-level in Kuhlthau's model of the zones  of 
intervention, as a <em>locator</em> and <em>identifier</em>, but many of the  
participants sought out information mediators who could intervene at a 
higher  level, as <em>advisors</em> and <em>counsellors</em> (<a href="#kuh">2004:129-134</a>).</p>

<p> Perhaps the librarian was  willing and able to offer a higher level of 
mediation but in the event, the  participants did not seem to be 
interested in or even aware of the possibility  of this sort of 
discourse with the librarian. Given that the participants had  the 
wherewithal to use talk as a metacognitive strategy, the strategy was 
not  employed with the one person who ought to really understand the 
information  environment, the librarian. Although it seems natural that
 young people (or  any information seeker, for that matter) would 
approach people from within  their immediate circle first, people who 
are easily accessible and whom they trust, it does seem unfortunate 
that dialogue with the  librarian was rarely part of the participants' 
metacognitive tool kit. </p>

<p>Perhaps  there is a broader obligation here. The young people in this
 study were  surrounded by people who had some level of expertise in the
 subjects being  researched, people who read, who had home libraries or 
access to materials at  work, or who were simply interested in what the 
participants were doing. The  participants knew that dialogue with 
knowledgeable others was a useful  metacognitive strategy but they also 
had the social resources needed to  implement it. One wonders what might
 happen in those cases where a student has  little to no social support.
 How useful is <em>talk</em> as a metacognitive strategy  for people who have 
no one to talk to? </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There was a strong social component  attached to metacognitive 
knowledge during the information search process. The  young people in 
this study actively sought humans to act as both information  mediators 
and information sources. The natural way in which they turned to the  
people around them for help suggests that social processes during 
information  seeking, even information seeking for the purposes of 
completing school assignments,  should play an important role in the 
design of library and information systems  and services for young 
people. More  specifically, utilizing the social component of 
metacognitive knowledge to its  maximum benefit is perhaps an important 
lesson that needs to be taught to young  people.</p>

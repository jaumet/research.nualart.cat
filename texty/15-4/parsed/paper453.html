<meta name="dc.description" content="A model to explore the relations among local and global relevance-based information behaviour is proposed that is based on objective and subjective measures of the relevance of the Website contents. The model is based on a case study carried on an e-learning portal that is devoted to information literacy competences development and is highly structured, allowing for precise measures of the relation among contents, aims and use. First, the global interest for the Website was researched using data on visits. Statistics were compiled about the use of the different sections and pages and therefore on the users' interest in the different competences and sub-competences. Second, local use was explored with two surveys on the motivations and self-assessed knowledge of a group of fifteen students, administered to them before and after being exposed to the information site. Third, both datasets were compared, and a relation was found between the number of visits to each sub-competence and the improvement in the subjective assessment of students' competence after using the site. Results suggest that improvement in competence perception and the number of visits are, in general, measures of the site relevance that offer similar results, despite of the fact that the first measure is based in the whole population of visitors to the site and is merely objective and the second one is based on a limited survey and provide information about the cognitive state of the users in relation to the Web contents. Regarding general data, the most visited competences are those of a more general interest (like learning to learn), and the students show a big pre-test confidence in their knowledge of most of the studied competences. The results support the hypothesis that the increase in the subjective level of competence in an e-learning site is a good predictor of the whole success of a site, when working with their primary intended audience. In this dimension, a strong and demonstrable relation between the macro/global and micro/local levels of analysis appears to exist. In the future, it would be interesting to carry out expert evaluation of the real IL competences of the students, to have independent measures of their level of competence." />

<h2>Aims and context</h2>

<p>This study intends to explore the similarities and differences in the behaviour of the large audience of an e-learning Website, <em>Alfin-EEES</em>, on the one hand, and, on the other, a local subset of its main theoretical constituency of users, in this case, first-year university students.</p>

<p>In a more <span>abstract</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>sense, the study tries to offer insights into the relation between the macro-environment of a Website, its global audience, and the specific use that a well-defined group of target users would make and is making of the system: a micro-environment. Last but not least, it provides a model to study the relation between relevance and other variables like use, expectations and motivation in an e-learning site. Such studies can be interesting both for theoretical and practical reasons, as  presented  below.</p>

<h3>Theoretical context</h3>

<p>Relevance is one of the key aspects in information retrieval, and has been the object of extensive research. It could not be otherwise, because relevance is the ultimate measure of the effectiveness of an information system. Relevance has been the topic of an enormous corpus of research with very different approaches (see <a href="#sa07a">Saracevic 2007a</a>, <a href="#sa07b">2007b</a>, for a recent review), some dealing with users' judgments and other more related to information systems architecture or document contents. Also, many constructs have been identified behind relevance that are useful to explain it, such as topicality, novelty and reliability. Eleven different factors were identified in a single study (<a href="#wang98">Wang and Soergel 1998</a>; <a href="#wang99">Wang and White 1999</a>).</p>

<p>Of the many approaches possible, this paper is interested in the relation between <em>gross</em> sociological <span>measurements</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the relevance of a Website (like the number of visits recorded in Web logs) and psychological measures of relevance provided by selected target audiences and that are related to their motivations and expectations.</p>
  
<p>In particular, this paper tries to research the relationships among three very different groups of measures related to the relevance of Website contents, with the peculiarity that the first is objective and the other two are subjective, and intend to capture a <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>change in the user after being exposed to a Website.</p>

<ul>
<li>The first is the number of visits that each site, section or page receives. It is supposed that, under normal conditions, more visits imply that some content is con0ered more relevant, an approach that, of course, is widely used.</li>

<li>The second is a user's judgement of the relevance of a section of the Website to their professional future and that of its peers.</li>

<li>The third  is a self-estimation of the user's knowledge of this topic.</li>
</ul>  

<p>The last two measures can be combined in different aggregations. When compared with the number of visits, only one of them offered consistent results: that consisting in the difference between the perception of competence before and after a preliminary but comprehensive use of the site, or, in other words, the change in the self-assessed competence after being exposed to a Website. This was an empirical relation found after
reviewing different results regarding the relevance assigned by a group of students to the contents of the Website and a self-assessment of their relative competence in them, before and after being exposed to the Website.</p>

<p>The resulting theoretical model is expressed in Figure 1. The two user aspects that are explored regarding relevance are a) expectations as a result of previous knowledge and b) motivation that results form the perception of a knowledge gap.</p>
  
<p>Relevance is seen as eliciting the three different <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of responses that are studied: relevance judgements, self-competence judgements and the use of the Website. It is supposed that if an item is judged more relevant after using the information, this is related with a growing sense of the previous knowledge gap, because previous knowledge remains constant and, therefore, the relevance assigned to this piece of information increases.</p>

<h3>Applied research</h3>

<p>This research was very interested in
contributing to a model of how relevance judgments are affected by user
behaviour, but also practical implications arise. </p>

<p>The relation between the global and local
use of information is a very important question to develop fine models for Web
site evaluation. This is a general problem in Web-based information systems
and, consequently, also a key question for e-learning sites and, more
specifically, for <em>AlfinEEES</em>, a portal that intends to offer relevant
information in the specific field of generic and information competences.</p>

<p>It is a general problem because a Website
is a project subjected to the <span>laws</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of economy. It has a demand and it is by
fulfilling this demand in an effective and efficient way, that it will get the
resources it needs to thrive. </p>

<p>But on the other 0e, a Website, by its very nature, has a world-wide audience and this opens a door to a potential paradox: it might be that a Website is being successfully visited by a theoretically sufficient number of users, and that, on the other hand, it is failing to address its real <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>audience, the one that makes it a feasible project.</p>

<h3>Organization of the paper</h3>

<p>This paper explains the results obtained in
the research <span>experiment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and discusses the main conclusions that were reached.
It is organized in four parts: first, the case study Website is briefly described and explained, attending to its aims, philosophy and content architecture; secondly, the
methodology of the study is presented, which is summarily based on the
comparison between Weblogs, on one 0e, and some relevance-related tests with
a small <span>survey</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of first year students; thirdly, the results about this relationship
are offered; and, finally, the results are discussed, the main conclusions are
summarized; and some perspectives for future research are offered.</p>

<h2>The target Website <em>AlfinEEES</em>: a brief explanation</h2>

<p><em><a href="http://www.mariapinto.es/alfineees/AlfinEEES.htm" target="_blank">Alfin-EEES</a></em> (Pinto <a href="#pin05">2005</a>, <a href="#pin06">2006</a>) stands for
<em>Alfabetizaci&oacute;n Informacional en el Espacio Europeo de Educaci&oacute;n Superior</em>,
that is, <em>Information Literacy in the Higher Education European Space</em>. It is a
Website developed by a team directed by Maria Pinto with a research grant from
the Spanish Ministry of Education.</p>

<p>The portal was designed to provide online
training in information competences for higher education students with a wider
scope than usual, inserting information competencies into the frame of the
development of generic competences, a key aspect of the Tuning project and the
Bologna process (<a href="#gon03">Gonz&aacute;lez and Wagenaar 2003</a>).</p>

<p>Alfin-EEES is organized hierarchically in
competencies and sub-competencies. From the home page the user can also access
the presentation of the project, the mention of credits and authorship and the
support tools. The presentation explains the underlying philosophy, objectives,
methodology and contents. The support tools are of different types: a) information
seeking tools&mdash;the map of the site and the search engine; b) help
in using the site&mdash;help and contact; c) study support materials&mdash;glossary,
list of general resources (the specific resources appear in each of the
sub-competencies) and in the future, FAQs; and d) for communication&mdash;forums, e-mail and chat rooms.</p>

<p>The main part of the content architecture is the taxonomy of the six competencies, <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>into their
sub-competencies, which are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learning to learn: the <span>concept</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of learning to learn is explained, how to learn to learn, how to be autonomous and in charge of our own learning process.</li>

<li>Learning to seek and assess information.</li>

<li>Learning to analyse, synthesize, and communicate: how to read better, how to segment the information to subsequently reorganize it using the techniques of outlining, graphic representation and summary and how to communicate the new knowledge in writing and using graphic presentations while respecting the contribution ofauthors whose <span>ideas</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>have been used. </li>

<li>Learning to generate knowledge: in-depth study of the processes of creation and innovation, of the principles of scientific thought and of the techniques for organizing projects, to train the student in the principle phases of knowledge creation: creation, research and development.</li>

<li>Learning to work with others: the ethical bases for co-existence and teamwork are posed, as well as how to recognize and approach conflict, using win-win negotiation techniques.</li>

<li>Using technology to learn: operational systems, office <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>applications, communication tools and the e-learning environments most often used in universities are introduced.</li>
</ul>

<p>The competencies and sub-competencies are
related to the knowledge production cycle, documentation, analysis, synthesis,
communication and to its sub-contexts: working within a community
and often as part of a group, contemplated in turn within the objective
of educational intervention, which is teaching to learn to learn at the
university level (Figure 2). The screen with the whole set of <span>categories</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is
presented in Figure 3 and its translation is available in Table 2.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>Fortunately the highly structured nature of the portal content allows for a precise recounting of the use of the Website and, subsequently, an easy correspondence between this information and the data regarding the users' attitudes and self-assessment results on their information literacy sub-competences. This one of the reasons for <em>AlfinEEES</em> serving as a <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>bed for this study. </p>

<p>First, the global interest for the Website
was researched using the site traffic logs, with Google Analytics. As
<em>Alfin-EEES</em> is highly structured, each page or group of pages corresponds to
each competence or sub-competence, as explained above. So, it is very easy to compare the interest of the global audience in
each competence and use this data to make comparisons.</p>

<p>Secondly, two surveys were carried out on a group
of nineteen students of the first year of the undergraduate library and information science programme of
the University of Saragossa during November 2009, with the aim
of evaluating their interest in each competence and their statements about
their subjective level of competence, both individually and in relation to
their group. The first <span>survey</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>was carried out on 11<sup>th</sup> November  before
being exposed to the <em>Alfin-EEES</em> Website, as a pre-test condition. The second
<span>survey</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> using exactly the same items, was carried out on 29<sup>th</sup> November 
after they have extensively used the site, as a post-test condition. </p>

<p>The students were asked about the importance of each competence and sub-competence for their professional future and their personal opinion about their level of competence in each topic and
about the level of competence of their whole group. They were asked also about their overall competence in information technologies and information management. All the questions were measured with a five-point scale. A reproduction of the <span>survey</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>Webpage is offered in  Figure 5  and is available
at  the <a href="http://www.mariapinto.es/alfineees/cuestionario.htm">Alfin-EEES Website</a>.
The topics have been translated to English in Table 2. </p>

<p>To simplify, trying not to confuse them, the students were asked only for the sub-competences, assuming
that the competences could be calculated as a mean of their sub-competences. This was proved partially untrue when a control question was introduced on 'Learning to analyse information'. This is a very interesting finding and a prospective hypothesis to explain it can be advanced: it is probably so because
the competences are complex constructs that do not match exactly the sub-competences
for all the population, so that, in practice, the designers of the systems and
the users might have different <span>concepts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>about them.</p>

audience, as showed by Google Analytics, that cannot be stratified
accordingly to the initial target audience. It is supposed that the more a Web
page is used, the more relevant is for a community or various communities of
users; and that this measure has <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in0e the site, that is, the
more a page is visited in relation to the rest, the more relevant it is, and
vice versa.</p>

<p>To study the <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>audience, a survey
was applied to a group of university students. The <span>survey</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>intends to establish
the interest of the students in each competence (and sub-competence) by asking
them about the importance of each item for their future. So, an indicator of
relevance was obtained for each competence and sub-competence. Be0es that, it
asks the students about their level of knowledge on each competence, trying to
establish if it is related to their interests. This <span>survey</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is done before they
know <em>Alfin-EEES</em>. This information serves as an estimator of the existing gap in
their knowledge.</p>

<p>Later, they were exposed to <em>Alfin-EEES</em> and
the <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>was applied again to get information about how their new knowledge on
information and generic competences had affected their perception of the
importance of each item.</p>

<p>As may be seen in Figure 6, the studied
variables are con0ered expressive of the basic constructs that are studied:
user motivation, which increases or decreases the assignment of relevance to an
information item (e.g., a Web page on an information literacy competence), and eliciting a using
behaviour. As a result of this behaviour,  users re-evaluate both their
interest in the information and their competence and the relevance of this item
changes accordingly.</p>

<p>In the future, a <span>measurement</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the actual
competences would be needed to complement data based on the students'
self-reports. In this way, we will be able to obtain information in both
directions: a) how the objective IL tools may diverge from students' opinions
on their competence; and b) how students' self-perception differs from the
standard consensus among information specialists. The research team has developed <a
href="http://www.infolitrans.edu.es/" target="blank">a tool</a> for the online assessment of information competences and is conducting the first tests. </p>

<p>Finally, it would be interesting to research a black point in the model, that is, how student interests affect
their exposition to information literacy information. This could be done, for example, measuring
the time that students spend in each page of the Website or how many times
they access the different Web pages.</p>

<h3>Macro-analysis: using visit statistics to understand the users' interest</h3>

<p>To get a glimpse of the topics of interest
to the <em>Alfin-EEES</em> audience, the Google Analytics data were normalized, obtaining
the percentage of visits to each competence and their sub-competences since
2005, and also an index that compares the visits per page in each item with the
mean of visits per page for the whole site (Table 2).</p>

'Learning to learn', which is understandable, as it is the most
interdisciplinary, so with a bigger potential target
audience, and a key topic of interest in pedagogy. The same can be
said of the second and the third, 'Learning to analyse, synthesize and
communicate information', and 'Learning to create knowledge'. Very near is the
fourth <span>category</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> which is the most specific of the library and information

'Autonomous learning', 'Learning to segment', 'Learning to analyse' and
'Learning to learn'. On a page-by-page basis, 'Learning to analyse' is, by far,
the most visited; and the least visited is 'Ethics'. </p>

<h3>Micro-analysis: assessing the motivations of a group of freshmen</h3>

<p>The results of the two surveys with the freshmen from the University of Saragossa are provided in Table 3. The importance and subjective assessments of their competence and that of their group's are offered before (pre-test) and after (post-test) working with <em>Alfin-EEES</em>. The differences between their competence and the importance they give to each sub-competence have been calculated and also the differences before and after the <span>test</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The students seem to think that all the
sub-competences proposed are very important for their future, as they give them
scores of more than '4'. It is curious, but not surprising, in a world that is
becoming more social and interconnected, that they give the maximum
punctuation to learning 'Decision-taking and negotiating'. The least
punctuation is for 'Learning to segment', which they probably see as very peripheral
or do not even understand.</p>

<p>In general, the students have a very
positive impression of their competences in information management and other
related generic competences, and data does not show great differences between
their own assessment and the one they do of their peers'. They show a great
confidence in the materials that they are offered, and they think that they
have improved quickly in their competence after reading and using them, as it
can be inferred from the punctuation.</p>

<p>Results could be very conditioned by local
experiences. For example, the significant difference in 'Learning to search for
information' could be affected by strong motivation and fresh new knowledge on
the topic, because this is a subject they were just trying to pass at the moment
of the <span>survey</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> The same can be said of their struggling with digital 'Learning
environments'.</p>

<p>After their exposition to <em>Alfin-EEES</em>,
'Learning to write' and 'Learning to work in group' become more important. This
is probably also a local effect, as these aspects are very important in the
teaching methodology that is followed in the library and information science undergraduate programme of the
University of Saragossa.</p>

<h2>Comparing both groups of data</h2>

<p>After extensively reviewing line graphics for the different sets of data, it can be affirmed that there is a general lack of correlation in the information offered by page visits and the relevance and
competence data offered by the group students. Only in the general
competence related to autonomous learning and the general ability to learn, a
great correlation can be <span>observed</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> (A recent study, with a completely different methodology, found that simple '<em>user relevance rankings had little or no predictive power</em>' about the actual use of a Web page to solve a problem (<a href="#coi08">Coiera and Vickland 2008</a>)</p>

<p>From this lack of connection, it seems clear
that the Website is used by other audiences that give, for example, a great
importance to learning to learn, autonomous learning, and segmenting and
schematizing information.</p>

<p>There is, in any event, an important exception to
this lack of correlations. It affects the comparison between the percentage of
visited pages per <span>category</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and the improvement in the perception of competence
before and after the use of <em>Alfin-EEES</em>, as it is showed by the difference in
'My competence' after the exposition to the e-learning Website (Figure 8). If
the number is positive, that means that the subjective sense of competence of
the students has grown after using the system, and vice versa.</p>

<p>This difference of subjective competence
before and after using the system can be con0ered a measure of the value of
the materials offered in the Website (relevance), and it certainly
correlates (with some exceptions) with the visits that the sub-competence
Web pages are receiving. It is remarkable that this correlation is not working
at all in the topics related to technology, which are not the stronger part of
the contents (mainly because their rapid obsolescence), a fact that might be in
fact strengthening the hypothesis. </p>

<h2>Conclusions and future work</h2>

<p>The strong relation between the shape of
the percentage of visits, which was postulated as a measure of relevance at
the macro-level, and the change in the subjective perception of personal
competence after being 
exposed to the Website, a measure of the information gap that has been
covered by the site, supports the hypothesis that the increase in the
subjective level of competence in an e-learning site is a good predictor of the
whole success of a site, when working with their <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>intended audience. In
this dimension, a strong and demonstrable relation between the macro/global and
micro/local levels of analysis appears to exist.</p>

<p>From a theoretical point of view, this is
just another confirmation of the relation between the information gap on the
part of the user, measured throughout the process of knowledge improvement, and
the information relevance on the part of the <em>collection</em>. From this
perspective, relevance appears to be something connected with the perceived
information gap, even a function of it. </p>

<p>Be0es that, the study provides further
insights in the relation between relevance and use of a Website, on the one
hand, and the expectations and motivations of the users, on the other hand; and
a model to study them.</p>

<p>Taking into account a more practical and
applied perspective, the change in the subjective perception of personal
competence indicator is interesting because it is not a
direct or intrusive one, and, in consequence, it is less prone to be
manipulated by the users. As a result, it could be used as a relatively
inexpensive non-intrusive pre-test of the relevance of a site or as a
complementary evaluation tool.</p>

<p>An important result of this study is that
the correlation was clearly affected by the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the
materials (technological pages get quickly out of date) and the
existence of different potential audiences for a Website, in this case not
only library and information science undergraduatess but probably also pedagogy and school and high school teachers and
students. For these reasons, the model should be enriched in
the future to deal with the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the collections and target group
segmentation.</p>

<p>It is a clear finding also, that students
are overly optimistic about their competence and that of their peers. So, an
objective assessment of the information capabilities of the constituency is
necessary also in the future, and should be incorporated to the model, too.</p>

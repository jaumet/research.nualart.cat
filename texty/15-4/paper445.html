<h2>Introduction</h2> 
 
<p>Long-term digital preservation is one of the highest priorities of
many agencies supporting and funding research. One simply has to look
at the abundance of projects on the topic conducted over the last ten
years: to name just a few, PRESTO - Digital preservation technology
(<a href="#wri01">Wright 2001</a>), Digital Preservation Europe (<a href="#dig06">Digital&#8230; 2006</a>); LIWA - Living
Web Archives (<a href="#liv08"> Living&#8230; 2008</a>); PLANETS - Preservation and Long-term
Access through Networked Services (<a href="#pla07">PLANETS 2007</a>); CASPAR - Cultural,
Artistic and Scientific knowledge for Preservation, Access and
Retrieval (<a href="#cas06">CASPAR 2006</a>); SHERPA - Digital Preservation: Creating a
Persistent Preservation Environment for Institutional Repositories
(<a href="#she06">SHERPA 2006</a>); Digital Preservation Lifecycle Management: Building A
Demonstration Prototype for the Preservation of Large Scale Multimedia
Collections (<a href="#raj">Rajasekar n.d.</a>). The agencies include the US Government,
the European Union, the UK's Joint Information Systems Committee, and
similar organization in other countries. Some of the projects
concentrate on more general digital preservation theory and its
technological implementation, others focus on certain domain areas, such as
culture, art, heritage, research and education, industry, engineering, or
publishing. or on certain types of institutions: memory
institutions (archives, libraries and museums), producers of databases,
large scientific organizations (like NASA), private companies or public
departments facing the need to preserve data and documents. </p> 
 
<p> The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the role that information
behaviour research may play in information system design. As a result,
our work is closer to the information requirements literature of
information systems research than it is to information behaviour
research. We would argue, however, that it is important for these
fields to come together, particularly in the world of digital
information resources. From the methodological point of view we explore
the value of <em>use cases</em> in defining information requirements and
consider their wider application in information behaviour research.</p>

<p>The paper draws upon two streams of data analysis: first, an
analysis of the literature on long-term digital preservation systems
(and, to a degree, digital libraries) and secondly, analysis of
interviews undertaken in the course of the SHAMAN project.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Long-term digital preservation.</h3>

<p>The preservation of the cultural, organizational and even personal
record has been, until the very recent past, concerned with books,
unbound paper documents, film negatives, slides and prints, movie
films, radiographic images, and a thousand and one other 'documentary'
forms. The physical space requirements for the long-term preservation
of these materials are enormous: for example, at the end of 2009, the
British Library opened a new storage facility in Yorkshire with 262
kilometres of 'shelf space' (<a href="#pem09">Pembrey 2009</a>) and, in part, digital
preservation of records of these kinds is seen as at least part of the
solution to the increased demand for physical storage. We leave out of
consideration here the need to preserve actual objects of culture, such
as painting, sculptures, tools and archaeological artefacts, necessity
to digitise images of these objects and also to take
such accurate measurements that it is possible to reproduce physical
objects such as sculptures (<a href="#dig10">Digital&#8230; 2010</a>). These data may be digitally
preserved so that, if the object is lost, an exact copy can be
automatically reproduced, potentially in the same material as the
original.</p>

<p>In addition to the digitization of existing physical materials,
there is the increasingly significant body of born-digital material,
which covers not only such things as e-mail, word-processed documents
and spreadsheets, but e-books, sound recordings, films, scientific data
sets, social science data archives, health-related patient data and
many more. To these we can add the entirety of the World Wide Web and,
possibly, millions of organizational intranets. It has been claimed
that there is now so much born digital material that it will be
impossible to store it all: thus, in 2007 the amount of data produced
more or less equalled the available storage capacity but production and
storage capacity are diverging so rapidly that it was estimated that by
2011 '<em>almost half of the digital universe will have no home</em>' (<a href="#idc08">IDC 2008</a>:
2).</p>

<p>In this context, long-term digital preservation has particular
problems: first, there is a proliferation of file formats for almost
every kind of 'document', only some of which will survive into the
future. Consequently, ways must be found to ensure that obsolete
formats can be interpreted in the future. Secondly, the technology for
producing, storing and reading digital files is changing constantly.
The most obvious example is in portable storage: we have gone from 8
inch floppy discs, via 5&#188; inch, to 3&#189; inch and on to zip drives and
discs, CD-ROM, DVDs and, now, USB drives. Does anyone own an 8 inch
floppy drive, or even a 5&#188; inch drive? Such things are no longer
installed in computers. The result is that files prepared for obsolete
technology, may also be unreadable in the future. The best known
example of this is the case of the BBC's Domesday Project (<a href="#fin09">Finney
2009</a>), which recorded information about British society in the 1980s,
celebrating the original Domesday Book, which was compiled after the
Norman invasion of Britain in 1066. The technology used for the project
was the interactive videodisc, which rapidly proved <em>not</em> to be the
technology of the future. A further project (CAMiLEON) was launched to
retrieve the information from the videodiscs and a successful emulator
was developed (<a href="#dar03">Darlington <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>) To date, however, no means has
been found to make the project material generally available and, as it
cannot be used, it is to all intents and purposes, still lost.</p>

<h3>The  SHAMAN project</h3>

<p>One of the projects funded by the European Union's Seventh Framework
Programme, SHAMAN - Sustaining Heritage through Multivalent ArchiviNg,
builds on many earlier technological developments and directs its
efforts, &quot;to supply a comprehensive, systematic and dynamic means
for preserving any type of electronic record, free from dependence on
any specific hardware and software&quot; by integrating data grid, digital
libraries and persistent archive technologies (<a href="#wat07">Watry 2007</a>: 41).</p> 

<p>The development concentrates on building the prototypes for the
institutions in three application domains: heritage preservation in
memory institutions; industrial design and engineering data
preservation in companies; preservation of scientific data collections
in e-science area. A key element in the Project is the adoption of data
grid technology to facilitate intercommunication among participating
archives. To be accepted by the target communities the solutions
provided by the research and development activities have to answer the
existing needs and moreover to take into account the existing practice
and legacy systems. The user communities targeted by the project are
rather different from the point of view of the preservation activities
carried out in them, the experience and understanding of preservation
problems, and also by the previous investigations into their long-term
preservation needs.</p>

<p>The fundamental aim of the SHAMAN Project is to overcome the
problems set out above in the development of a framework for long-term
digital preservation. The specific aim of SHAMAN is encapsulated in
this statement from the Description of work:</p>

<blockquote>
Effectively, we need to <strong>send into the future not
only the information, but also a description of the environment that is
being used to manage and read that information</strong>. Thus, the
proposal differs from the current generation of digital preservation
projects, which are primarily focused on the short-term management of
preservation services and not solving the fundamental problem of
technological obsolescence. (<a href="#sha07">SHAMAN 2007</a>: 5)
</blockquote>

<p>To accomplish this, the Project has identified four principles upon which the systems must be based:</p>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Authenticity, assertions about the provenance of the records.</li>
<li>Integrity, assertions about the management of the records.</li>
<li>Chain of custody, assertions about the ownership of the records, and</li>
<li>Context of production, preservation, access and reuse.  (<a href="#sha07">SHAMAN 2007</a>: 5)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>and is in the process of developing tools for &quot;analysing, ingesting,
managing, accessing and reusing information objects and data&quot; (<a href="#sha07">SHAMAN
2007</a>: 3). As part of the process, investigations have been carried out
into the user, operator and organizational requirements for systems
development, the results of which are reported here.</p> 

<h2>Literature analysis</h2>

<p>The kind of long-term digital preservation system proposed by SHAMAN
is novel and, consequently, the literature available on the different
kinds of requirements is rather limited. What we have attempted,
therefore, is an analysis of the literature on digital libraries and
digital preservation more generally, with the aim of arriving at a
conceptual framework for research and proposals for further
investigations.</p>

<p>From the literature, we can identify four broad categories: society
at large, generating requirements for long-term preservation, which are
often only implicit in papers on the general need to preserve a
culture; organizational requirements, which will vary depending upon
the nature of the organization, for example, whether it is a public
sector organization like a local authority or a business firm;
organizational staff who must operate the preservation system,
undertaking the functions of ingest, access and delivery to end-users;
and, finally, end-users in the normal definition of the term, i.e.,
members of the organization who need to draw upon the digital resource,
or scholars, students and members of the general public who may need
access to help them with their work, study or research.</p>

<h3>Societal needs</h3>

<p>We begin our analysis at the societal level, partly because it is in
this area that the literature is so scarce, but also because the
requirements set by society affect the requirements of the other
actors. Generally, society's needs are usually spoken of in terms of
the need to preserve the record of the society's culture over time; for
example Drijfout (<a href="#dri01">2001</a>) notes that a failure to ensure long-term
preservation, '<em>will damage future scholarship and weaken our scientific
and cultural heritage</em>'. Smith (<a href="#smi07">2007</a>) provides a more detailed analysis
of the notion of the social value of preservation. </p>

<h3>Organizational needs</h3>

<p>We can examine organizational needs from two perspectives: first,
the requirements organizations have for long-term preservation systems;
that is, what must such a system do in order to be useful to the
organization? Secondly, we can consider what information an
organization needs in order to make decisions about the choice of
systems and in making policy decisions about long-term preservation in
general. The literature on the first of these perspectives is much more
extensive than on the second; in fact, our searches have produced no
research papers that deal with the second issue. We can, however, make
some reasonable guesses about what is needed.</p>

<p>The organizations with which we are chiefly concerned in the SHAMAN
Project are those concerned with the preservation of the cultural
record. Clearly, there is considerable overlap, in such cases, between
the needs of the organization and the needs of society. 'Cultural
memory' institutions are, in effect, the agencies tasked by society to
deliver preservation of the cultural record.</p>

<p>A major project exploring the issue of choosing a preservation
strategy has been the DELOS Project. This Project evolved a process for
choosing a preservation strategy, using utility analysis (<a href="#rau04">Rauch 2004</a>),
and proposed that organizational needs could be categorized under four
headings: file characteristics, record characteristics, process
characteristics, and costs (<a href="#str06">Strodle <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>). To these, we would
add a fifth, which often appears in such lists, the knowledge required
by staff who operate or use the system. The four categories presented
by Strodle, <em>et al.</em> are what they call '<em>top level</em>' categories, which
include much more specific elements: thus, in the case of file
characteristics, the category includes appearance, content and
structure and, at an even lower level, such matters as image
resolution, macro support and embedded metadata. The significance of
file type ought not to be underestimated: a study carried out at
G&ouml;ttingen University (<a href="#neu06">Neuroth <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>) revealed a total of ninety-six
different file formats used by the staff of the university and,
additionally, some proprietary formats were in use with specific
software.</p>

<h3>Organizational staff needs</h3>

<p>We have in mind here, the needs of those members of staff of the
organization who manage and operate the long-term preservation system.
We can group such staff into three categories, which we shall call,
technical, management and service staff. Technical staff are
responsible for the maintenance of the systems and any digitization
that may be done, management staff are responsible for selecting and,
in some cases, acquiring materials, allocation of metadata, ingesting
(a term used by the preservation community to denote uploading)
materials and other document management issues, and service staff are
responsible for delivering service to users from the digital resource.</p>

<p>In other words, there are a number of different roles associated
with digital preservation and, in its requirements study, the SHAMAN
project has identified roles such as, preservation manager, collection
manager, technology manager and auditor.</p>

<p>The literature on what organizational staff need of a system appears
to be almost non-existent. The focus appears to be on the new skills
that staff may need to function in the long-term digital preservation
domain. For example, in the allied area of Web archiving Murray and
Hsieh (<a href="#mur08">2008</a>) found that librarians were concerned about issues such as
how to select material for digitization, how to assess the authenticity
of materials, how to cope with the increased load of metadata
production and cataloguing, and how best to provide access. We have
been unable to locate an equivalent study for long-term preservation
systems, but it seems likely that the same issues will arise. </p>
 
<h3>End-users' needs</h3>

<p>Again, the very idea of long-term digital preservation systems is so
new that the needs of the ultimate user, the scholar or citizen who
needs access to the digital record, have not been explored. The closest
we come to the digital archive user is the digital library user and we
can imagine that the two will have at least closely associated needs.
Even here, however, the literature on user needs is limited: much of
the material found deals with issues such as search behaviour, or the
design of personal access portals, or aspects of information retrieval,
and other problems. In fact, we found only three papers that offered
ideas that fit our conception of the notion of end-users' needs. </p> 

<p>First, Xie (<a href="#xie08">2008</a>) sets out the criteria according to which users
assess digital libraries (in this case the Library of Congress's
American Memory site), listing interface usability, collection quality,
service quality, system performance and user satisfaction. Within these
categories one can find a number of finer-grained variables: for example, under
collection quality we have scope, authority, accuracy, completeness,
currency and copyright, all of which would apply to a long-term
preservation system, but, in the case of the SHAMAN Project we would
add, because of the need to migrate digital resources between different
technologies, integrity, that is, the user will expect the original
content of the document to be preserved as it was at the point of
ingest to the original system.</p>

<p>Secondly, Inskip <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ins08">2008</a>), after exploring the needs of users
of a folk music collection, note that if the search process of a user
is reflected in system design for a digital library then it would
include the provision of background information to an item (and this
may be as true for a memory institution's archive item as for a folk
song), browsing capability, links between sources (again, true of much
digital archive material) and links to other information sources.</p>

<p>Finally, Abdullah and Zainab (<a href="#abd07">2007</a>) point to more directly
systems-oriented issues: registering and managing user information;
creating reports and uploading digital objects (how far the latter
would be allowed would be a matter for preservation policy); searching
for and retrieving information; indexing digital resources (a
long-term preservation system under the SHAMAN model would have
metadata performing this role, but we can imagine a personal access
system, perhaps based on the user's own server, which allowed tagging
by the user); system network robustness (where the SHAMAN proposal for
the use of grid technology would help); and the system operation
schedule and the extent to which it managed and controlled access.</p>

<p>A composite set of these requirements together with those already
developed for the SHAMAN Assessment Framework, constitutes, in our
view, a valid framework for the analysis of users' needs.</p>

<h2>SHAMAN results analysis</h2>

<p>The SHAMAN project may serve as an exemplary node of all the
problems outlined above. It focuses on the development of the
preservation technology, which, though building on earlier research and
developments, has to meet the future requirements of long-term
preservation of many interested parties. The problems faced by
long-term preservation in the digital environment are quite well known
and many of them have been decomposed into a variety of aspects and
elements while looking for solutions as one sees from the literature
analysis. Despite this, there are quite significant obscure areas,
especially with regard to the future infrastructures, actors, policies
and digital resources themselves. </p>

<p>Therefore, investigating these future requirements for the
technologies that do not yet exist is a significant issue, even if
system developers are used to defining system requirements. The
difficulty, in this case, was recognized by the project partners at the
very beginning and they began by collecting data about existing needs
for long-term digital preservation and about the exploitation of
existing systems of this type in working environments. We also used
significant work done earlier in establishing the requirements for
trusted repositories (TRAC) (<a href="#rlg07">RLG-NARA&#8230; 2007</a>) and defining risks for
long-term preservation of digital information (<a href="#dra08">DRAMBORA 2008</a>). In
addition, a certain leap of imagination was allowed to fill in the
gap between the known practices or expressed needs and the unknown
future demands.</p>

<p>The nature of the SHAMAN framework itself also posed a number of
difficulties - one of them was the need to take into account the
requirements posed by system's end-users, i.e., librarians, curators,
archivists, and also end-users of the preserved documents, for example,
scholars, students and members of the public. There was also a group of
the system users, less visible than the other two groups, that is,
publishers, owners of intellectual property and producers of digital
objects, who were submitting them for preservation. This group
introduces problems of its own: it is interested in preservation of
their products and in developing access services and, though not doing
this itself, nevertheless wants to safeguard its interests and creates
other requirements important to both processes (preservation and
access).</p>

<p>Besides, the SHAMAN framework is intended to become a universal
solution for long-term digital preservation. Therefore, the project
addresses three quite different domains of focus that have become main
sources of data collected for the development of system requirements.</p>

<h3>Domains of interest</h3>

<p>The three domains of focus for the SHAMAN project are: memory
institutions, which have been interested in the preservation of our
documented heritage for a long time and have developed different
approaches to restoration, conservation, and preservation of various
collections of many different objects (written, visual, audio, natural
and cultural objects); engineering and industrial design organizations,
which have very different attitude towards digital preservation. They
are commercial organizations and digital preservation has legal (e.g.,
contractual) and economic implications. For example, the re-use of
designs may help saving development time and so reduce development costs. So
far, however, little has been done in this area (<a href="#heu09">Heutelbeck <em>et al.</em>
2009</a>); and e-science groups and institutions, where we see increasing
use of digital technologies in research work for processing huge
amounts of digital data in natural and technical sciences generated by
modern data collection technologies and where the actual digital
preservation needs of researchers are actively supported by funding
agencies and explored on different levels and in different contexts
(see, for example, <a href="#lor03">Lord and Macdonald 2003</a>).</p>

<p>The differences between the domains are quite significant and this
adds to the challenge of investigating the needs for long-term digital
preservation.</p> 

<h3>Nature of the data</h3>

<p>The bulk of data collection for establishing the requirements for
long-term preservation technology was done during the first year of the
project (2008). However, it is regarded as an ongoing process affecting
each stage of prototype development. Thus, the evaluation of the
emerging technological solutions by the customer organizations and end
users is regarded as further user requirements' data fed back into the
process of research and development to guide the process. </p>

<p>When exploring complex problems in which the unknown, or
uncertainty, or both, prevails, the research methods usually
recommended are those which help researchers to understand the nature
and the key elements of the problem better, i.e. approaches that allow
the structure of the explored phenomenon to emerge from empirical data
(<a href="#lay98">Layder 1998</a>: 26-27). Usually, this approach requires the use of
qualitative methods of data collection and interpretation. However, the
underlying epistemology does not have to be exclusively interpretative.
Within a technology-oriented project such as SHAMAN, which is
inevitably based on positivist epistemology, it is important that
underlying methodological assumptions in different parts of the project
do not contradict each other. (<a href="#sha09">SHAMAN 2009</a>: 5)</p>

<p><em>Contextual enquiry</em> is one of the most suitable modes of positivist enquiry using
qualitative methods for establishing how a particular process is
performed by actors and what actual needs and requirements they and
their tasks impose on the variety of tools and systems used in the
process:</p>

<blockquote><span style="font-style: normal;">Contextual inquiry</span>
is an explicit step for understanding who the customers really are and
how they work on a day-to-day basis. The design team conducts
one-on-one field interviews with customers in their workplace to
discover what matters in the work. A contextual interviewer observes
users as they work and inquires into the users' actions as they unfold
to understand their motivations and strategy. The interviewer and user,
through discussion, develop a shared interpretation of the work.
(<a href="#hol01">Holtzblatt, 2001</a>: 19) </blockquote>

<p>The whole process of data collection and analysis for the project
was also guided by the concept of the Open Archival Information System
(OAIS), set out in '<em>Recommendations for an OAIS reference model</em>' (<a href="#ccs02">CCSDS
2002</a>).</p> 

<p>The data used in this paper were collected during a qualitative
stage involving semi-structured interviews with the actors in the
organizations working in the three SHAMAN domains referred to above.
Whenever possible, a semi-structured observation session was applied
and additional documentation was collected on site. Three different
interview schedules were developed for policy makers and managers, for
end-users of the preservation system (such as data curators, IT staff)
and consumers (users of preserved information). Twenty interviews were
conducted in eleven organizations. A slightly different approach was
taken in the domain of industrial design and engineering as there were
no actors such as preservation managers or data curators and archivists
because of the absence of preservation activities. Data were collected
through prolonged observation and exploration of the practices in
partner organizations and discussions with relevant persons. </p>

<p>The collected data was processed using the highly formalized
Universal Modelling Language to extract abstract information about
standard users, use cases and user scenarios. Both sets, i.e., the
interview transcripts and the extracted information are used in the
following part of the paper.</p>

<h3>Outcomes</h3>
 
<p>The interviews provided deep insight into the existing practices of
archiving, storing and preserving different digital materials (texts,
images, visual and audio recordings, data files of different formats)
in a limited number of institutions in several countries. Some storage
of digital objects was found to be present in all selected
organizations. However, they were very different in maintaining and
re-using the stored material. </p>

<p>Memory institutions with a mandate for a long-term preservation and
some scientific groups with deep interest in the re-use of research
data have elaborate policies and practices directed towards long-term
digital preservation, which include:</p>

<ul>
<li>plans and rules for the migration of documents;</li>
<li>regulation of relations between content providers and the preserving institution;</li> 
<li>copyright protection;</li>
<li>protection of the researcher's priority right to exploit collected data;</li>
<li>specifying the rights of different types of users to access the resources;</li>
<li>provisions for data exchange or sale; and </li>
<li>the responsibilities of the preserving organization towards its partners. </li>
</ul>
 
 <p>Some scientific organizations and industrial design
companies still do not make a clear difference between the archiving
function and preservation and are not concerned about future re-use of
their digital resources. Usually this may be associated with the
policies of the parent organization and/or traditional practice. </p>

<p>The organizations with developed preservation policies usually also
follow technical standards, procedures and rules in all work stages.
They have good grasp of the arising technological problems and either
have found, or are looking for, solutions. They usually plan to expand
their preservation activities, some of which may be limited by existing
resources or the lack of appropriate technologies to achieve the goal. </p> 

<p>On the basis of the interviews with the representatives of the
e-science and humanities groups a conceptual map was drawn to represent
a generalised picture of relations of different actors in preservation:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="p445fig1.png" alt="Fig 1: Concept map representing the actors identified in the preservation environment" width="830" height="598" /></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><br /><strong>Fig 1: Concept map representing the actors identified in the preservation environment. </strong></div>

<p>The actors (users, providers, employees or submitters) on the
contextual map include not only human beings but also other entities,
such as a system or legislation or an organization. All of them may
interact with the system to access digital objects or metadata about
them directly or through a mediator (Archivist).</p> 

<p>The first step of this analysis led to the development of a number of primary system requirements and use scenarios.</p>

<h4>System requirements</h4>

<p>The analysis of the data has produced eleven primary requirements
for the system. Some of them, like automatic meta-data extraction or
enhanced functions of document discovery, may also be found in other
information systems. Others, such as scalable storage capacity or
security and trust requirements, would be expected in relation to
preservation. Memory institutions that are already working with
archival systems need technology that is compatible with these systems
and which allows access and use of the data preserved in them. We will
have a closer look at several less predictable requirements.</p> 

<p>The interviews show that there is a need for viewing data in
obsolete formats without migrating it to a new format. This was
expressed mainly in the form of complaints about cumbersome migration
processes.</p> 

<p>This requirement naturally includes the necessity to preserve and
manage the provenance of digital data, which enables re-tracing of the
preservation process. But it is not enough to capture the context of
the document. The preservation system needs to capture the context of
digital objects in production and working environments and their
history. At present, much of this information is not embedded in the
document itself, which creates a problem that may be addressed by
developing policies and rules rather than technologies. Capturing the
information about the preservation system and technology used at the
time of the document creation or ingest would enable the maintenance of
the document's authenticity and integrity in the future.</p>

<h4>Use cases </h4>

<p>On the basis of the interviews a number of use cases were developed
for each domain of focus: forty-one for memory institutions,
thirty-nine for industrial design and engineering, and thirty-six for
e-science.</p>

<p>A use case relates to some functionality performed by a system. Each
use case constitutes a complete course of action initiated by an actor,
and specifies the interaction that takes place between an actor and the
system, indicates the goal of the action and identifies other actors
involved. 'Actors' may be persons or 'abstract' actors such as other
systems and/or sub-systems of the system under observation (<a href="#bit03">Bittner and
Spence 2003</a>). The Universal Modelling Language has become the de facto
standard for developing use cases.</p>

<p>Figure 2 below demonstrates the nature of the use case. In this
example, two actors are seen: a human actor, the Collection Manager,
and an abstract actor, the Import System. Five use cases are observed
in the diagram (the blue shapes), with the lines and relationship
statements indicating the connections between the cases and the actors.
The diagram shows that the Collection Manager is responsible for
organizing the separation of the data relating to a digital object from
the delivery carrier (i.e., the bit stream that carries the data), as
well as for managing the manual import, indexing and cataloguing,
before the metadata and the digital object are imported (partly
automatically) into the Import System (a sub-system of the preservation
system). The term &lt;extend&gt; simply means that the actions of use
case <em>Separation from the delivery carrier</em> are continued in use case <em>Import and indexing</em>. The term &lt;include&gt;' means that use case <em>Cataloguing</em> is included in use case <em>Import and indexing</em>, but can be separately distinguished from other operations there.</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img src="p445fig2.png" alt="Figure 2:  Use cases related to import and ingest with the main actor Collection Manager" width="779" height="352" /></div>
<div style="text-align: center;"><br /><strong>Figure 2:  Use cases related to import and ingest with the main actor Collection Manager (memory institutions) (<a href="#sha09">SHAMAN 2009</a>:50)</strong></div>

<p>The individual use cases are described in a standard format, as shown in Table 1 for the use case of cataloguing:</p>

<table style="border: medium solid rgb(153, 245, 251); font-size: smaller; font-style: normal; font-family: verdana,geneva,arial,helvetica,sans-serif; background-color: rgb(253, 255, 221);" width="80%" align="center" border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
<caption align="bottom"><br /><strong>Table 1: The use case 'Cataloguing' in memory institutions (<a href="#sha09">SHAMAN 2009</a>: 37)</strong></caption>
<tbody><tr><th style="width: 20%;">ID</th><th>UC-DOF1-323</th></tr>
<tr><td>Name</td><td>Cataloguing</td></tr>
<tr><td>Actors</td><td>Collection manager</td></tr>
<tr><td>Brief description</td><td>The new object is incorporated into the institutional catalogue.

<tr><td>Preconditions</td><td>Initiated by the import routines (UC-DOF1-320).</td></tr>

<tr><td>Post-conditions</td><td>Object is incorporated in the catalogue</td></tr>
<tr><td>References</td><td>See UC-DOF1-320</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The use cases define both stereotypical actors (such as <em>Collection Manager</em>) and stereotypical activities (<em>Cataloguing</em>).
From the point of view of system design, this is essential because of
the need for general descriptions of behaviour. There will be
individual exceptions in the way Jack or Jane or Sally function as <em>Collection Managers</em>, but systems have to be designed to cope with the generality of behaviour, not with the myriad exceptions.</p>

<p>Figure 3 shows another set of use cases associated with the <em>Consumer</em>
(or end-user, as it would be termed in information behaviour research).
Here, three of the use cases are associated with another use case, and
all function within an abstract <em>actor</em>, the <em>Access System</em>.  Again, we illustrate the content of a use case (Browse metadata catalogue) with Table 2.</p>

<tr><td>Post-conditions</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td>References</td><td>DOF3B-15, DOF3C-E3</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<br />
<p>Note that in Table 2, there are no 'post-conditions', that is, nothing happens in the system as a result of the <em>Consumer</em> browsing the catalogue.</p>

<p>These two brief examples illustrate how the original interview data
have been transformed by the Universal Modelling Language processes
into descriptions of use cases involving both human and system <em>actors</em>. </p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
 
<p>One of the continuing debates within (and outside) the information
behaviour research community is the relevance of such research for the
development and design of information systems. In the case of the
SHAMAN requirements definition process, we have seen collaboration
between information behaviour researchers and information systems
researchers in which the qualitative data from interviews has been
employed to identify 'stereotypical' users and use cases. We suggest
that this collaboration has been very fruitful, with the system
designers being given much richer data on the behaviour of system
actors than is normally the case.</p>

<p>The gap between information behaviour research and information
systems design has been exacerbated by a focus, within the former, upon
the behaviour of individuals. The concern has been to show how
individuals differ in their behaviour and to elicit the reasons for
these differences. Long-term preservation systems design and
development, however, requires an understanding of the generality of
actions performed in the preparation of the digital resource, its
manipulation within the system and its use by system managers,
operators and end-users.</p>

<p>We suggest that the apparent failure of information behaviour
research to influence information systems design (including information
retrieval systems) is not the result of some inherent flaw in research
methodologies, but lies in the lack of interaction between information
system designers and information behaviour researchers. Generally,
information behaviour researchers will not be part of a system
development team, rather, they will be pursuing some research topic
independently. The value of the work reported here is that it
demonstrates that information behaviour research can play a role in
systems design and that, far from having their perspective rejected,
information behaviour researchers are welcomed as full partners in the
process with a great deal to offer in terms of methods and perspectives.</p>

 <h4>Conclusion</h4>
 
<p>Virtually every civilization has assumed that the arrangements made
for the preservation of its culture would survive into the indefinite
future. At best, long-term preservation has been only partly achieved.
For example, the rich culture of ancient Greece survives only
partially; there are more lost dramatic works, for example, than those
that survive. Similarly, the eruption of Vesuvius destroyed a number of
libraries and, although modern technology may be able to revive some
burnt papyrus rolls, it is unlikely that all will be recovered. The
loss of the great library of Alexandria is well known, but less well
known is the loss of the great library at Wearmouth, in the North of
England (where the Venerable Bede wrote the first history of the
British people) as a result of the Viking invasion of Britain. War and
natural disasters have been the enemies of long-term preservation and,
at this point in history, we do not know whether the arrangements now
being made will enable preservation of the cultural record for another
thousand years, or five hundred, or even a century.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the effort has to be made and, as we have shown, there
are many projects in progress and completed that have long-term
preservation of digital resources as their focus. The aim of SHAMAN is
ambitious: it is to develop a framework to enable the design and
development of systems that will ensure that what is produced today, in
digital form, can be re-used at any time in the future, whether or not
the software and the hardware that enabled the digital production
continue to exist or not. Thinking about the future needs of the
operators, managers and users of such systems is an optimistic
endeavour, since we cannot know the nature of future systems or the
needs and behaviour of future users. However, the firmer the base upon
which preservation systems can be built, the more likely it is that
future archivists and users will be able to explore the digital record
of today.</p>

<p>Our ability to develop such systems, however, depends crucially upon
our understanding of human behaviour in relation to systems and upon
being able to identify not only differences (that may explain system
failures, for example) but also similarities and stereotypes. The
Universal Modelling Language with stereotypical actors and use cases
offers information behaviour researchers a way to engage with system
developers in a creative synergy.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2> 
 
<p>Traditional avenues of publishing are closed to many authors in developing countries. As a result, much of the research done in these countries is <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to researchers elsewhere (<a href="#fer06">Fernandez 2006</a>). In India there are a number of internationally-reputed institutions which are producing a good number of research <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that are expanding the frontier of knowledge and scope for technological innovation (<a href="#das05">Das <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>). As a country known internationally for its information technology industries, India is now also hosting the corporate R&amp;D centres of some <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>multinational enterprises owing to its global reputation for academic and research excellence (<a href="#das07">Das <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>). Poor access to international journals and the consequential low visibility of papers the papers they write are <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>problems facing Indian researchers. Open access is viewed as a solution to remedy this deficit (<a href="#fer06">Fernandez 2006</a>). 

Open access calls for the <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>availability of scholarly literature on the Internet. The open access movement has gained significant momentum over the past few years. It maintains that all scientific and scholarly literature should be available to all for <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>via the Internet (<a href="#blu06">Bluh 2006</a>; <a href="#mar06">Mark &amp; Shearer 2006</a>). What makes open access so important is its potential effect on visibility, usage and impact of research. The careers of researchers and funding of research <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>upon the up-take of their <span>findings</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> as does the progress of research itself. Academic institutions, federal agencies, publishers, editors, authors and librarians increasingly rely on citation analysis for promotion, tenure funding, and reviewer and <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>decisions (<a href="#meh07">Meho &amp; Yang 2007</a>). It has now been <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that research impact is increased by open access (<a href="#law01">Lawrence 2001</a>; <a href="#ant04">Antelman 2004</a>; <a href="#har04a">Harnad &amp; Brody 2004</a>; Harnad <a href="#har04b"> 2004</a>; Hajjem <em>et al.</em> 2005; Hajjem, Harnad &amp; Gingras 2005; Eysenbach 2006; Norris, Oppenheim, &amp; Rowland 2008 ). There are two ways to achieve open access to scholarly articles: by publishing in an open access journal or by depositing in an open access repository, known as open access publishing and open access archiving <span>respectively</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#cha04">Chan 2004</a>). The present study attempts to ascertain the trends in open access publishing in premier research institutes of India.</p> 

<h2>Objectives</h2> 

<p>The following objectives were laid down for the study:</p>

<ol>
<li>To assess the <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and trends of open access publications in select Indian research institutes.</li>
<li>To assess and compare the use of open access publishing across select Indian research institutions.</li>
</ol>

 
<h2>Scope</h2> 

<p>The scope of the present study is <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to research articles (excluding conference papers, reviews, letters, short surveys and editorials) published from 2003 to 2007 by the five premier research institutions of India.</p> 
 
<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>Elsevier's Scopus database is used to identify the top research contributing institutions of India and their corresponding research output covering a time <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of 2003 to 2007. Scopus claims to index 15,000 peer-reviewed journal titles including 1200 open access journals from 4000 publishers (www.info.scopus.com). The top five research institutions of India, by output, located by Scopus affiliation identifier are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Indian Institute of Science</li> 
<li>All India Institute of Medical Sciences</li> 
<li>Baba Atomic Research Centre</li> 
<li>Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi</li> 
<li>Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</li> 
</ul>

<p>The research article output of each of these institutions from 2003 to 2007 was ascertained through Scopus and the name of <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>journals along with the number of articles recorded (as of August 2008). All the 4,232 journal titles were searched in the  <a href="http://www.doaj.org/" target="_blank">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> and then using the <a href="www.google.com" target="_blank">Google <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>engine</a> to find out which are openly accessible. The data were tabulated and analysed in a systematic way to reveal <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in accordance with the research objectives.</p> 

<h2>Related literature</h2>

<p>Kingsley (<a href="#kin07">2007</a>) argues that the traditional scholarly journal system is outdated and in need of re-organization and that the new internet technologies provide opportunities for change. Ylotis (<a href="#ylo05">2005</a>) looks open access archives and open access journals as steps towards the democratization of information and knowledge by removing access restrictions. McCulloch (<a href="#mcc06">2006</a>) observes that open access initiative is dramatically transforming the process of scholarly communication, bringing great benefits to academic world. Chan and Costa (<a href="#cha05">2005</a>) argue that open access enriches the global knowledge base by incorporating the missing research from the less developed world and improves the south-north and south-south knowledge flow. Haider (<a href="#hai07">2007</a>) looks open access as a way to connect the developing world to the system of science, by providing access to scientific literature published in the developed world. Arunachalam (<a href="#aru08">2008</a>) stresses the need for an open access mandate by various research organizations in India for their own research output and for projects funded by them. Krishnamurthy (<a href="#kri08">2008</a>) sees open access, open <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>software and digital libraries as the natural result of the open models of exchange that help societies to grow and prosper. Falk (<a href="#fal04">2004</a>) observes that open access is gaining momentum with very broad support from library and professional groups, university faculties and even journal publishers.</p>

<p>Zhang (<a href="#zha07">2007</a>) <span>believes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that authors may take longer to fully realize the benefits of open access movement as presently they are confused by different open access platforms. However Herb and Muller (<a href="#her08">2008</a>) discovered that the scientists use open access services to an increasing extent after becoming <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>with them. Ramachandran and Scaria (<a href="#ram04">2004</a>) argue that majority of academics in the developing world are not well informed on how they could improve the visibility of their publications by making them open access. According to an international <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>by Rowlands and Nicholas (<a href="#row05">2005</a>), the proportion of authors publishing in an open access journals has grown con0erably from 11% in 2004 to 29% in 2005. Using the ISI database Bjork <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#bjo08">2008</a>) found that 4.6% of articles published in 23,750 peer reviewed journals in 2006 were openly available on the Internet in <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>open access journals, and that this percentage increased to 8.1% after an embargo <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of one year. Bhat (<a href="#bha08">2008</a>) found that a substantial number of research publications are available through open access journals in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The study further reveals that open access publishing is much popular in medical institutions than in other institutions of the state.</p>


<h2>Results and discussion</h2>

<p>Table 1 shows that 17,516 research articles are contributed by the five institutions and that these articles appear in 4232 journals.Out of 17,516 articles, 1367 (7.8%) are published in 245 open access journals with 884 (64.66%) published in 77 Indian open access journals and 483 (35.33%) articles published in 168 foreign open access journals. The  Chi-squared <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>was applied to determine whether the difference between open access publications of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and the other institutions is statistically significant. Chi-squared = 667.52, which is significant at the 0.05 <span>probability</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>level, meaning that we can claim that the Institute publishes significantly more in open access journals than the <span>rest</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Out of 2873 research articles published in 2003 by all the institutions 274 (9.53%) are in open access journals. In 2004 the percentage of open access articles decreases to 7.02% and in 2005 it slightly increases to 7.46%. In 2006 and 2007 the percentage of open access articles is 7.36% and 7.87% <span>respectively</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>(Table 2). Most of these articles (884  or 64.66%) appear in Indian open access journals.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2> 
 
<p>The present study reveals that only a small portion of research articles of Indian research institutes is published in open access journals with no substantial increase over the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of time. The medical institutions are contributing more of their publications in open access journals and the Engineering institutions the least. This confirms a trend identified in earlier research (<a href="#bha08">Bhat 2008</a>). The higher number of open access articles appear in Indian journals, although there are more <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>journals of foreign <span>origin</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> The study also reveals that only standard, peer reviewed open access journals (such as <em>Current Science, Acta Crystallographica Section E Structure Reports Online, Bulletin of Materials Science, Indian Pediatrics, Neurology India,</em> and <em>Pramana Journal of Physics</em>) are used by the Indian scientific <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>for dissemination of their research <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>
 
<h2>Limitations and Future Research</h2> 

<p>Publications in journals not covered by Scopus are not included in the study (as the Scopus database is used for identifying the research publications). Further studies need to be undertaken to ascertain the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>proportion of authors publishing in open access journals along with the <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>motivating factors.</p>

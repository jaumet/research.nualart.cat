<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Usability has been a continuing <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of interest in the digital library (DL) <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> In 1995 the US National Science Foundation sponsored &quot;How We Do User-Centered <span>Design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and Evaluation of Digital Libraries: <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Methodological Forum&quot; (<a href="#bis95">Bishop, 1995</a>). Two more recent examples of such workshops are the JCDL 2002 workshop, &quot;Usability of Digital Libraries&quot; (<a href="#bla02">Blandford &amp; Buchanan, 2002</a>) and the Fourth DELOS workshop, &quot;Evaluation of Digital Libraries: Testbeds, Measurements, and Metrics&quot; (<a href="#bor02">Borgman, 2002</a>), which, although not exclusively concerned with usability issues, included papers on user-centred topics.</p>

<p>Two general, comprehensive books about digital libraries each offer a chapter pertaining to usability: &quot;Usability and Retrieval Evaluation&quot; (<a href="#les97">Lesk, 1997</a>) and &quot;User Interfaces and Usability&quot; (<a href="#arm00">Arms, 2000</a>). Although both chapters emphasize fitting the DL interface to the user, neither suggests users be consulted or studied. Both take what may be called a &quot;weak&quot; approach to user-centred activity. Weak user-centredness <span>believes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>it is adequate to base <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>upon ergonomic 
principles gleaned from prior studies or upon best <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Strong user-centredness <span>believes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>own users, tasks, and <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>must be examined because <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>differ too much and <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is too complex an activity for general ergonomic principles and best <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> though important, to be <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(see <a href="#fla97">Flanagan, <em>et al.</em>, 1997</a>, for a similar, more comprehensive dichotomy).</p>

<p> One of the more common methods for studying users is laboratory-based user <span>testing</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> examining representative or surrogate users as they work through set tasks in a <span>controlled</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>environment. For example, a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of Digital Library Federation members reports:</p>

<blockquote>Half of the DLF respondents reported conducting or planning to conduct user protocols. With rare exception, libraries appear to view think-aloud protocols as the premier research method for assessing the usability of OPACs, Web pages, local digital collections, and vendor products. (<a href="#cov02">Covey, 2002</a>:  24).
</blockquote>

<p> Although we have used and continue to use laboratory-based <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in our work (<a href="#fuh01">Fuhrman,
<em><em>et al.</em></em>, 2001</a>; <a href="#swa02">Swan, <em>et al.</em>, 2002</a>; <a href="#swa02b">Swan, 2002b</a>; <a href="#swa03">Swan, 2003</a>), this paper describes studies of digital library usage in natural settings. We used three methods:</p>

<ul>
<li>User satisfaction questionnaire (2 studies).</li>
<li>Session activity logging.</li>
<li>Contextual inquiry.</li>
</ul>

<p>These studies were motivated by a recognition that laboratory-based <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>differs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>from <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>use, a difference we are exploring in greater detail (<a href="#not03">Notess &amp; Swan, 2003</a>). Unlike many studies of DL use, our studies primarily examined information use rather than information seeking. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>final characteristic of our user studies is that they are motivated by product design: we are  interested in learning about usage for the purpose of improving the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of our digital library. This intention places us in Fallman's (<a href="#fal03">2003</a>) 'research-oriented <span>design</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> category: we are focused on product, conducting user research in order to generate and improve that product. Although this paper presents <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>from our various user research methods, those <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are included because they illustrate the methods rather than because the user-study <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves are of general importance. The significant result in this paper is the <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of and <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>amongst the user study methods. After a brief <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of our digital music library <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> the method and <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of each study are summarized. Then, comparisons are <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>among the methods, looking at cost, skill requirements, and the nature and usefulness of the <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>Variations and Variations2</h2>

<p><strong>Variations</strong> is a heavily used digital music library, providing online access to music recordings and scores in the Indiana University (IU) Cook Music Library since 1996 (<a href="#dun99">Dunn &amp; Mayer, 1999</a>). <strong>Variations</strong> contains over 200 scores (printed music) and 8,000 near-CD <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>digitized recordings, most of which are classical, although jazz and popular music are also <span>represented</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The online <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>has grown in <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>response to requests for online reserve material or for access to special <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>items. Items are available from the online catalogue and from course reserve Web pages. Students can use <strong>Variations</strong>  recordings from any of ninety PCs in the music library. Faculty can use <strong>Variations</strong>  from several music classrooms to support instruction.</p>

<p>Items in <strong>Variations</strong> are accessed by URL. Recording URLs in the MARC-based online library catalogue (IUCAT) lead to a Web page summarizing the item and its contents. Links on course reserve pages also lead to item Web pages. The <strong>Variations</strong> player window (Figure 1) is invoked by clicking on a link on the item Web page. Because <strong>Variations</strong> audio files are stored on tape and copied to disc-based cache on demand, users may have to wait several minutes for the player to appear if no one has requested that item during the previous <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or two. <strong>Variations</strong> score items do not have summary Web pages: their
URLs display the scanned musical score in a standard browser window.</p>

<p><strong>Variations2</strong> is a completely new digital music library system under development as part of a research project (<a href="#var03">Variations2, 2003</a>). Even though the <strong>Variations2</strong> <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is quite <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>at this point (approximately sixty recordings and six scores), it is already deployed in the music library and has experienced pilot usage by several faculty and their <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> <strong>Variations2</strong> also <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>an audio player, but a score viewer and <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>window, along with additional functionality such as bookmarking, make <strong>Variations2</strong> a far more capable system than the original <strong>Variations</strong> (see <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>2).</p>

<h2>The questionnaire studies</h2>

<p>We have completed two questionnaire-based studies of <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>use. The first study looked at usage of Variations; the second study looked at usage of <strong>Variations2</strong> during a pilot deployment. Both studies used a user satisfaction questionnaire adapted from QUIS (<a href="#chi88">Chin, <em>et al.</em>, 1988</a>). The questionnaire <span>contained</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a section for collecting demographic information, presented 11 subjective satisfaction ratings on 7-point Likert scales, and invited respondents to offer additional comments.</p>

<p>The purpose of the first study was to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a baseline for user satisfaction with the existing DL implementation. Students in the Cook Music Library were recruited as they entered the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>laboratory</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Thirty <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>who used <strong>Variations</strong> during their visit completed a printed questionnaire after completing their planned work and received a gift certificate as compensation for their participation. While we could have surveyed music <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>at large (nearly all of whom use <strong>Variations</strong> regularly), we wanted to get questionnaire responses immediately after a specific experience with <strong>Variations</strong> rather than simply asking for their general feelings about the <span>software</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The purpose of the second study was to get an early comparative <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of user satisfaction with the new DL, again <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>after a specific experience. <strong>Variations2</strong> is not yet in broad use because of its <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>catalogue size, so we selected a particular class assignment for the
pilot. Approximately thirty <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in a graduate, song literature class were asked to complete a listening assignment (students listen to several songs and write an analysis of each), but for this pilot, they were required to use <strong>Variations2</strong> <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of Variations. Before the pilot, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were given a brief <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to <strong>Variations2</strong> along with a demonstration. The assignment was presented as a Web page with hyperlinks to each of the songs (<a href="#m5302">M531 Schubert listening assignment, 2002</a>). For each song, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>could access a recording, the score, and the song text in German and <span>English</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The song texts were provided in the score viewer as scanned images even though they were not scores. The Web page also invited them to click on a link and complete a Web-based satisfaction questionnaire after completing the assignment, but no compensation was <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for doing so. Twelve <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>submitted questionnaires.</p>

<h2>The session activity logging study</h2>

<p>The <strong>Variations2</strong> <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>logs user activity. For this study we examined log files generated during the song literature pilot assignment mentioned above. Unlike many <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>log studies of digital libraries (e.g., <a href="#jon00">Jones, <em>et al.</em>, 2000</a>), users in our study were not searching for items in a digital library. Because items in the pilot assignment were pre-identified, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>did not need to <span>search</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> They merely opened the item and used it.</p>

<h3>Log file analysis method</h3>

<p>Each log file entry contains a timestamp, an identifier for the window, and information about the user <span>action</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Hence, logging captures information about window opening, closing and resizing; button pressing, etc.</p>

<p>Text-based log files are <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>processed by scripts. We developed some basic <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for extracting each session from the log file into a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>text file and creating a summary file showing the <span>length</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of each session and the materials accessed. Beyond that we did not use any specialized <span>tools</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Analysis
has been performed using <span>Unix</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>text processing command <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>tools.</p>

<p>A second form of analysis is the manual examination of a log file to try to reconstruct what the user did. The researcher walks through an individual session file performing a step-by-step analysis to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the user's experience.</p>

<h3>Log file analysis results</h3>

<p> Table 3 shows a <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of metrics that were generated from the log files. Although there were 175 total sessions, only sessions that included accessing media were analysed. The other sessions were either <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or neglected login attempts (13) or sessions where <strong>Variations2</strong> was launched from
the Start menu (34). In these latter cases, <span>zero</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or more searches were performed but no items were opened.</p>

<p>Manual analysis <span>yields</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a picture of an individual session. We have not completed manual analysis for the sessions, but we offer a narrative <span>representation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for one complete fifteen-minute session below as an example, using a pseudonym for the anonymous user. </p>

<blockquote>Karita began her session by clicking on the first song (3:02 in length) on the pilot assignment Web page. It took 28 seconds for her to log in, see the audio player, and hear the song. 16 seconds later, she paused the audio. 81 seconds later Karita clicked on the hyperlink in the audio player to view the <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>bibliographic information of the recording. After 6 seconds, she clicked on the score link on the assignment Web page. The score viewer took 11 seconds to appear. 45 seconds later, she closed the 'view <span>details</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> window and maximized the score viewer. After 9 seconds, she clicked the 'Zoom in' button (zoomed to 70%). 7 seconds later, in the audio player, she clicked the 'rewind' button and then pressed 'play'. 20 seconds later, Karita clicked the 'next page' arrow in the score viewer (the score for the song is two pages long). 28 seconds later, she clicked the 'previous page' arrow (the song has a repeat of all but the two-measure introduction). After 27 seconds, she again went to the second page, and after 30 more seconds, again
back to the first page. 18 seconds later, Karita brought up the song text and translation by clicking on the Web page link. The text viewer took only 3 seconds to appear. Karita immediately   maximized the text viewer window. After 14 seconds, she went to the next page in the text (the text is split across 2 pages). 27 seconds later she pressed the 'stop' button on the audio player (this is 10 seconds before the song's end, but the singing had stopped and it was evident from the decrescendo that the song was over). After 67 seconds, Karita restarted the audio by clicking on the track in the track <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and pressing 'play'. She immediately paged back to the first page in the text viewer. 41 seconds later she clicked to go to the next page, and then quickly went back and forward again. 94 seconds later she stopped the player 30 seconds shy of the song's end. Then there was no activity for 3 minutes, after which she restarted the audio as before and moved the slider twice to listen to specific parts of the song (for 11 and 21 seconds, respectively). Following a 69-second break, she proceeded to the second song in the listening <span>list</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The second audio player took only 3 seconds to appear. Karita then closed the first player, stopped the second one with the 'stop' button and then closed each of the remaining windows, ending the session. </blockquote>

<p>This session does not reveal any <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>issues. The slow initial startup is a known problem. The incident at the end of the session (starting a new audio player and then ending the session) is enigmatic but uninterpretable from the session's data. Looking at an immediately <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>session from the same
<span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>address, we can guess that Karita started a new session 42 minutes long and completed the entire assignment in these two sessions. But the reason for closing all the windows and then starting a new session 16 seconds later remains <span>unknown</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>A minor issue raised by this session is that Karita uses the 'stop' button and a click on the track <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to go back to the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the song. The <strong>Variations2</strong> 'stop' button rewinds the recording all the way to the <span>beginning</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> unlike the <strong>Variations</strong> 'stop' button, which maintains playback position (analogous to 'pause'). </p>

<p>Knowing the nature of this specific assignment, we can make guesses about the reason for the gaps in listening: the student was <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>up the song analysis, which is the deliverable for this assignment. But this is merely a guess. </p>

<h2>The contextual inquiry study</h2>


<p>Contextual inquiry is a field study <span>technique</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>combining observation and interview methods to gain an interpretation of work practice (<a href="#bey98">Beyer &amp; Holtzblatt, 1998</a>). The researcher watches someone doing normal work activity, takes notes, and asks questions to ensure a shared interpretation of the activity. Beyer &amp; Holtzblatt's Contextual <span>Design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>process adds on to contextual inquiry a method for building work models (diagrams) with the inquiry data. The present study used both contextual inquiry and the work modelling process.</p>

<p>Four graduate voice <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(3 male, 1 female) were <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>during 14 contextual inquiry sessions that focused on information usage patterns in academic study. Participants were selected from among volunteers recruited in a graduate song literature class. Participants received a gift certificate for participating in up to 5 hours of sessions. We <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of academic activities. Although we mainly <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>library work, we wanted to get a holistic picture of the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> information-related activities, so we also included observations of voice lessons, a class session and a rehearsal. The library work often included use of Variations, but not <strong>Variations2</strong>, which at that time had an extremely <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>amount of content.</p>

<p>For each contextual inquiry session, the participants were asked to do whatever work they needed to do next and were <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in their usual <span>contexts</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> typically a library <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>carrel or work <span>table</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> While a participant worked, the researcher took handwritten notes. Discussion of the work sometimes happened during the observations, and the sessions nearly always ended with a discussion of the <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>activity. The <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of both the observations and <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>was to understand what the user was doing and why. Especially of interest were any problems participants encountered in their work (breakdowns).</p>

<h3>Contextual inquiry findings</h3>

<p>Most of the observations (10/14) occurred in the music library. Kinds of activities <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Listening assignment: <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>listen to an assigned set of songs, or select from among assigned songs, and write brief <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of what they hear and think.   (The pilot assignment described in the log file analysis section, above, is this kind of assignment.)</li> 

<li>Recital assignment: <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>plan an imaginary voice recital following one or more specific themes, e.g., British <span>art</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>songs related by some thread such as having the same poet or same subject matter.</li> 

<li>Audition 'package' preparation: <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>auditioning for, e.g., a summer singing job, select vocal material to polish that will meet usual audition criteria for quantity and variety while also showing off the strengths of their individual voices.</li> 

<li>Lesson piece, recital or <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>part preparation: <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>study a particular piece or part for <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in their lesson, recital or a production. <span>Study</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>includes not only listening to and/or watching various performances but also uncovering background information about the composer, the poet, the performers, etc. <span>Study</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>may also include making a literal translation of the text.</li> 

<li>Song analysis project: <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>perform an in-depth analysis of a particular song, tracing its history through various performers and performances.</li> 

<li>Examination preparation: <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>study a body of work so that they can identify and <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a given song upon hearing it in an examination.</li></ul>

<p>Contextual inquiry generates a large amount of data, and the work models themselves are also <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>extensive</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> This paper presents a fraction of the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to give a flavour for the kind of results achievable with this research method. Of the various work models constructed from the data, the <span>sequence</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>model was the most interesting. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>sequence</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>model captures the step-by-step actions users take to accomplish an intent. Multiple <span>sequence</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>models can be consolidated to <span>derive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>typical task sequences for a category of work. Table 4 shows a high-level view of a consolidated <span>sequence</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>model. The contextual inquiry data from the library observations consolidated into two <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>sequences, 'study in detail' and 'collect and select'. The two consolidated sequences share their overall activity structure (shown in the first column) and also share some steps (shown by the <span>table</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>cells that span both of the right-hand columns). Although there were indications (and it is rather obvious) that the 'collect and select' consolidated <span>sequence</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is sometimes <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by 'study in detail', none of the sessions included both.</p>

well as between faculty (e.g., willingness to put the item URL on an assignment sheet and hand it out to students).</p>

<h2>Comparison of methods</h2>

<p>User study methods can be compared in several dimensions. From the  <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of research methodology, the satisfaction questionnaires and log analysis are primarily quantitative whereas contextual inquiry is a <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>approach. Using Wilson's (<a href="#wil02">2002</a>) methods <span>classification</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> satisfaction questionnaires are an indirect, imposed method of observation; contextual inquiry and log analysis are both <span>direct</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> emergent forms of observation, albeit very different ones. For broad descriptions of and comparisons amongst user study methods, see Kuniavsky (<a href="#kun03">2003</a>). The paper by Covey (<a href="#cov02">2002</a>) provides a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of how such methods are currently used in research libraries, and Bishop, <em>et al.</em>, (<a href="#bis03">2003</a>) contains a variety of digital library user study reports.</p>

<p>In this section, we will describe our experience with each of the methods we used in terms of the
expertise and time required, other costs, and the kind of benefit derived. In examining benefits, we <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>whether the results seem most helpful formatively (for design) and/or summatively (for overall system assessment).</p>

<h3>Questionnaire studies</h3>

<p>The chief expertise required for our questionnaire studies was <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>design. The need for this expertise was moderately reduced because we borrowed ideas and items from an <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>user satisfaction <span>instrument</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#chi88">Chin, <em>et al.</em>, 1988</a>). However, <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>design was still important because we wanted to modify the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to fit our study, which included adding items. Some Web form processing technical expertise was required to set up the online <span>survey</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>For the first questionnaire, conducted at point of use in the library, we spent three <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>three-hour sessions recruiting participants. After we collected the paper surveys, it took a half-day to transcribe the results. The second questionnaire, conducted online, took a half-day to create, aided by a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>generator tool (<a href="#pernd">Perlman, n.d.</a>). This <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>took no time to administer and several minutes to copy and paste the e-mailed responses into a text file, which was then imported into a spreadsheet. For both questionnaires, analysis time was <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to a half-day spent categorizing the <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>response data and summarizing the demographic and Likert-scale items. An additional cost of the first questionnaire study was providing gift certificates <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>$3 for each of the 30 participants.</p>


<p>The benefit derived from the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>data was mainly summative: the ability to compare between
<strong>Variations</strong> and <strong>Variations2</strong>, identifying <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>differences. The formative benefit was not large. Although we learn key satisfiers, dissatisfiers, and opportunities for improvement, the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>tended to confirm things we already knew or suspected. For example, we 
<span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>would appreciate not having to wait while recordings were  copied from tape to <span>disk</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and in fact the <strong>Variations2</strong> <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>results confirmed this. But the <span>survey</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>s open-ended items also yielded insights we did not expect, e.g., that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were delighted with the online scores because they felt they were wasting time hunting down scores in the library. This insight suggests an 
area for further <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>so that we can better characterize the benefit of <strong>Variations2</strong> to library patrons. Also helpful were the five recommendations for user interface improvement from one respondent.  But many of the open-ended item responses were unhelpfully cryptic (e.g., &quot;I love Variations!&quot;, while heartening, doesn't give us much to work on).</p>

<h3>Session logging study</h3>

<p>Our session logging study required significant technical expertise. To log user activity, we had to  insert <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>into our <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>at the appropriate places so that, when users click a button or take some other <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in <strong>Variations2</strong>, the <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>writes out a record of that <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to the log file. This required expertise in <span>Java</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>programming as well as access to the <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>code. Processing of the data was accomplished by <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>some <span>Perl</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>scripts and running <span>Unix</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>commands. The <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>session analysis was accomplished by hand on paper but also required running <strong>Variations2</strong> and examining logging output experimentally to try to reproduce the <span>sequence</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>entries</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in the log file.</p>

<p>Once the logging <span>mechanism</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>was in place, the study took no time to execute. Analysing the results has taken several days and is still incomplete. For example, analysing the fifteen-minute session included in this paper took approximately two hours and is the only session we have yet analysed in detail. To
analyse and summarize all sixty-four hours of data would be a full-time job for several months. There were no additional costs for this study beyond <span>disk</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>space, which only amounted to a trivial 1.4MB for all the log files.</p>

<p>The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>benefit of the session logging data was obtaining <span>accurate</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> quantitative measures of overall utilization and <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>usage. These data may identify usability problems or issues addressable either by training or <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>modification, but the benefit is more summative. Part of the problem is that the log files do not tell us anything about user motivation or rationale. For instance, we noted that only 11% of user sessions used bookmarking. But we do not know why the other 89% did not make use of this <span>feature</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Was it because they did not see the feature? Or because they did not need it for the tasks they were doing? We can only guess.</p>

<p>Detailed log file analysis <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>more promise in providing formative insights, but such analysis can likewise raise as many questions as it answers. Why did the user close all the windows after opening the second audio player and then immediately restart? Log file analysis <span>raises</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>such questions; other methods
must answer them.</p>

<h3>Contextual inquiry study</h3>

<p>The contextual inquiries and <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis required expertise in the Contextual <span>Design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>methodology, a skill best developed by guided practice under expert supervision.</p>

<p>The inquiry sessions took eight to ten hours to plan and arrange, including visiting a class to explain the study and recruit participants, and email exchanges with participants to schedule the sessions. Because contextual inquiry is a real-time method, the fourteen inquiries of one to two hours in <span>length</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>took approximately twenty-four hours to conduct. Creating the work models and then putting them into a presentable format took approximately ten days. An additional cost of this study was $25 gift certificates for each of the four participants.</p>

<p>Contextual inquiry illuminated how our <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>fit into users' tasks and <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>strength of the method is the comprehensive user stories it generates. The stories are also <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(because of the observations and note taking) and memorable (because they were seen first hand). We have used contextual inquiry data to make <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>decisions and prioritize requirements, a significant formative benefit. The researcher who conducted the inquiries internalized much of the data simply by observing, but the modelling process helped identify patterns and made the results sharable with the other members of the development team. The small number of subjects in this study <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the summative benefit.</p>

<p>Without exception, the contextual inquiry participants (people being observed) were enthusiastic about the process. They enjoyed sharing their work and life with someone who was interested in understanding it and possibly improving it. Scheduling observations was sometimes difficult because of the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> busy schedules. Because of this, contextual inquiry is not a method to be used on a very short time schedule.</p>

<p>It is not necessary, of course, to use these methods in isolation from one 
another. We are using all these methods in our research and development effort, 
and it can be very helpful to compare <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>amongst methods. For example, the 
lowest-rated item in the <strong>Variations2</strong> satisfaction <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>was 'number of 
screens/windows: confusing - very clear'. Our log analysis helps us 
determine how many windows users had open at one time (maximum was seven). This 
combined information on usage patterns and satisfaction can help us seek better 
<span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>solutions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> For example, we are now working on a playlist concept so 
that <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> listening pieces for a given unit may all be accessed from within 
a single window.</p>


<p>Contextual inquiry, because of its high cost, cannot be done often enough to 
provide quantitative data. So even though we discovered two common work 
activities, 'collect and select' and 'study in detail', contextual inquiry will 
not tell us what proportion of users engage in which type of activity. However, 
it is a simple matter to use a questionnaire to determine this, and we can base 
the questionnaire items on the task steps uncovered by contextual inquiry.</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>


<p>This paper has described using three methods to study digital library use in
its natural <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and has also compared the costs and benefits of the methods.
Each of these methods has its value, and we plan to continue using all
three. The time required for contextual inquiry can be reduced simply by
doing fewer sessions. Watching even one user is likely better than
watching none. We can build better <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for analysing log files, perhaps
automating much of the metrics generation. Questionnaires
offer an
inexpensive albeit gross measure of user satisfaction and occasionally yield
helpful suggestions. And all three methods can be fruitfully combined to provide 
a more holistic picture of use.</p>


<p>A limitation of this paper is that we did not apply all three methods to the
same digital library: the studies were split between <strong>Variations</strong> and
<strong>Variations2</strong>. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>opportunity is to use all three methods during a
pilot project and compare the value of the results. In addition, <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>from
these studies of usage should be compared to <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>from laboratory-based <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to
help us better understand the difference between the two <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>
Finally, we plan to compare <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>from different user populations to see how
DL use by, e.g., a small <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of graduate voice <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>compares to other user
communities.</p>

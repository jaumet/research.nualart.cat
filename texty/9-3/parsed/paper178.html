<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Whilst information dissemination has been the subject of much scrutiny, a recent PhD study highlighted the paucity of research con0ering the dissemination of information in crisis situations. Previous research has con0ered crisis situations from a management <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(Pijnenburg &amp; van Duin, <a href="#Pijnenburg">1990</a>), an information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>perspective (Pelletier &amp; Msukwa,<a href="#Pelletier">1990</a>) or a risk communication <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(MacLehose <em>et al.</em>, <a href= "#MacLehose"> 2001</a>) but not from a specific information behaviour <span>perspective</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 

<p>Initially, it was anticipated that the research project would produce guidelines for practitioners detailing the procedures and methods required for effective information dissemination in crises. It was anticipated that collation of the results of several studies would highlight the most consistently effective method or methods of dissemination. In the event, the <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>systematic review conducted for this research project did not yield the anticipated result, as the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the studies reviewed were not <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>comparable in this <span>regard</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Another method of synthesis and analysis of the review studies was required to facilitate the extraction of meaningful data from the body of research retrieved. The review studies were comparable on an <span>interpretive</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>level that enabled the extraction of the key factors relating to effective information dissemination from the accounts. Thus, although the research was unable to identify specific effective information dissemination methods, by using a meta-ethnographic approach to synthesis and analysis of the review studies the researcher was able to construct a model of effective information dissemination from the key factors highlighted. The application of this model to the specific circumstances of the crisis study resulted in the construction of a model of effective information dissemination in a crisis.</p> 

<h2>The study</h2>

<p>The crisis at the heart of the study was a large-scale <span>outbreak</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of suspected tuberculosis (TB) infection. Two aspects of the information dissemination process during the suspected TB <span>outbreak</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were examined. The study <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to identify the existing evidence of the effectiveness of information dissemination <span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and also con0ered the effectiveness of the information dissemination effort during the incident. The broad aim of the research was to characterise and evaluate the dissemination of information to the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>during the crisis. It was envisaged that characterising the dissemination of information during the suspected TB incident would involve constructing a definition of effective information dissemination, thereby requiring the identification and determination of both the nature and <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of existing research con0ering the effectiveness of information dissemination <span>strategies</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The evaluation of the information dissemination process during the suspected TB incident could then utilise the characterisation of effective information dissemination as a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for the <span>remainder</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the study.</p>

<h2>A <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>systematic review of the research literature</h2>

<p>In the health field, studies investigating outbreaks of infectious diseases, similar to the early stages of the suspected TB incident, would seek to &quot;quantify risk factors and highlight statistically significant variables&quot;, thereby enabling identification of probable sources of infection (Llewellyn, <em>et al.</em>,<a href= "#Llewellyn">1998</a>). Published research papers in the information research field, however, encompass a diversity of methodological <span>approaches</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The methodological approach taken in this project was broadly <span>qualitative</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> although some elements of quantitative research were employed where appropriate. The study corresponds to Stake's (<a href= "#Stake">1998</a>) definition of an instrumental case study, where the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the research is upon providing an insight into an issue, in this case the effectiveness of information dissemination <span>strategies</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>method employed in the first phase of the fieldwork was a <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>systematic review of the research literature. Unlike traditional literature reviews, which may be &quot;no more than a subjective assessment by an expert using a select group of materials to support their conclusion&quot;, the systematic review is <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to be &quot;<em>systematic</em> in both the identification and evaluation of materials, <em>objective</em> in its  interpretation and <em>reproducible</em> in its conclusions&quot; (University of Sheffield, <a href= "#sheff">1996</a>). Collating the results of a number of small studies in the systematic review process increases the power of the conclusions <span>reached</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> In this project it was originally anticipated that collating a number of studies, con0ering the effectiveness of particular information dissemination methods, would <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>whether specific dissemination methods were consistently effective regardless of the circumstances of the dissemination. The review question set for this project, therefore, was: <em >&quot;To determine, for any population, the effectiveness of various information dissemination methods from the <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of both the user and the provider of the information.&quot;</em ></p>

<p>Con0eration of the initial <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>results, however, highlighted that the user, or recipient, of the information is not in a position to determine the effectiveness of a dissemination strategy. The effectiveness of the strategy can only be determined in relation to criteria that are set by the information provider and are generally <span>unknown</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to the recipient. The user, however, will have his or her own <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on the effectiveness of the dissemination process, which may not always concur with that <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by the information provider. In addition, where, for example, the measure of effectiveness is a change in attitude, the information provider is unable to determine the outcome of the dissemination process without the cooperation of the information recipient in the evaluation process. As the systematic review being conducted here was <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to inform the <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>stages of the study, which <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to gain an holistic picture of the information dissemination process during the suspected TB incident, the review question was amended to:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;To determine, for any population, the effectiveness of various information dissemination methods, from criteria set by the information provider, which relate to the information recipient and incorporate the user's <span>perspective</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot;</blockquote>

<p>From the retrieved records sixteen studies conformed to the criteria set for the review (see <a href="#appA">Appendix A</a>). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>further two relevant studies were identified from a hand <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>occurring journal and finally, two studies were identified from the references of relevant papers. These twenty studies provided the foundations of the model of effective information dissemination in a crisis <span>ultimately</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>constructed during the study. </p>

<p>Although the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for relevant literature was deliberately wide-ranging (see <a href="#appB">
<span>Appendix</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>B</a>), all but two of the studies retrieved were in the field of health information dissemination. This reflects, perhaps, the importance of effective communication of health information particularly and the need for research-based evidence in this field. </p>

<h2>Synthesis and analysis</h2>

<p>The twenty relevant studies retrieved for the systematic review employed a variety of dissemination methods to inform their target populations, ranging from live presentations (Sox <em>et al.</em>. <a href="#Sox">1984</a>) to an interactive <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(Llewellyn-Thomas <em>et al.</em>. <a href="#Llewellyn-Thomas">1995</a>). As the review statement deliberately did not define the particular populations that the relevant studies should serve, the populations covered by the research projects were  diverse. The effectiveness of the dissemination methods employed was evaluated by the researchers in relation to at least one of three outcome measures:</p> 

<ol type="1|2|">
<li>An increase in the recipient's knowledge of the particular issue to which the information related.</li>
<li>A change in the recipient's attitude, e.g., reduced anxiety, towards the issue.</li>
<li>A change in the recipient's behaviour, e.g., compliance with cancer screening <span>tests</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></li>
</ol>

<p>The research designs employed in the studies encompassed a wide <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and included such diverse designs as randomised <span>controlled</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>trials and observation studies. The research designs employed in the studies thus reflected the variety of outcomes <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by the researchers.</p> 

<p>At the outset of the project it was anticipated that collation of the reported results would highlight the most effective method of dissemination. Two factors, however, prevented this. The first factor was the definition of effectiveness employed for the evaluation, and the second was the <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>experienced by researchers in attributing changes in knowledge or behaviour to the particular method being evaluated. The determination of effectiveness had, in a number of studies, a <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>impact upon the perceived success of the project. In one study, for example, the desired outcome, a change in behaviour, was not identified, and although a change in attitude was detected in one group of participants the evaluators still <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that the dissemination method was ineffective (Graham <em>et al.</em>. <a href= "#Graham">2000</a>). Similarly, another evaluation of a dissemination strategy aiming to influence teachers' and administrators' readiness to adopt a tobacco prevention programme was not con0ered effective, this despite an increase in the administrators' understanding of the programme being <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>attributable to one element of the strategy (Brink <em>et al.</em>. <a href= "#Brink">1995</a>). Illustrating the second factor was a study where the researchers were unable to identify significant behaviour changes in the target group that could be attributed to the specific dissemination strategy (Tietge, <em>et al.</em>, <a href="#Tietge">1987</a>). This was due to an already high compliance rate with the anticipated behaviour and widespread diffusion of relevant information from other sources. The problem is particularly evident in large-scale information studies. Thus, an evaluation of a radio drama <span>concluded</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> that &quot;while the general population improved in the <span>accuracy</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of its knowledge of AIDS and in its awareness of being at risk, these changes could not be linked to listening to the radio drama alone.&quot; (Yoder, <em>et al.</em>, <a href= "#Yoder">1996</a>).</p>

<h2>A meta-ethnographic approach</h2>

<p>Qualitative data analysis generally entails reducing the <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the data collected by categorising and then making <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>between the categories. Meta-ethnography, developed by Noblit and Hare (<a href="#Noblit">1988</a>) retains the essence of <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>data analysis, whilst adhering to the tenet of replicability at the heart of the systematic review process. Meta-ethnography was <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to be a &quot;rigorous procedure for deriving substantive <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>about any set of ethnographic or <span>interpretive</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>studies&quot; (Noblit &amp; Hare, <a href="#Noblit">1988</a>). The approach does not attempt to aggregate the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of numerous studies, but <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>aims to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the multiplicity of their <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The key elements of the meta-ethnographic process are the determination of the relationships between the studies, the translation of the studies into one another and the synthesis of these <span>translations</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> To highlight the relationships between the studies Noblit and Hare <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>creating a <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of key metaphors, phrases, ideas and concepts used in each account and juxtaposing them. Translation is the vehicle used to allow comparisons to be made between the key metaphors, and a further level of synthesis is <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by analysing types of <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and translating them into each other.</p>

<p>The core of the meta-ethnographic approach is the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the key metaphors from each account. The <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of this review was, therefore, identification of the elements of an effective dissemination strategy. This method of synthesis is an <span>interpretive</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>process and it is important to acknowledge that the report produced represents one <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the accounts; other authors with dissimilar interests may read the accounts differently. However, recording an audit trail, which enables a reader to follow the actions taken will ensure that, whilst an alternative <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is possible the basis for the proposed model is readily apparent to the reader. The evidence for the key metaphors employed in this study is provided in <a href="#appC">Appendix C</a>. From this evidence the reader can trace the evolution of the meta-ethnographic synthesis from the individual <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>through the key concepts to the initial <span>representation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>displayed in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>1. </p>

<h2>Key concepts</h2>

<p>One of the first factors highlighted by this process was also noted in the initial attempt to synthesise the studies; the variety of measures employed in the studies. These measures, therefore, constituted the first set of key concepts extracted from the accounts. Similarly, problems associated with attributing changes to the specific method of dissemination were noted in several of the studies and grouped together under the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>evaluation. </p>

<p>Another set of <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>ideas extracted from the accounts related to the theme of knowledge <span>acquisition</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The concepts of an individual's need for new knowledge and their awareness of knowledge sources were identified as key factors, and, particularly in studies where a change in behaviour was <span>sought</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> the individual's willingness to change as a result of new knowledge was also a significant factor. Linked to this in a number of studies was the concept of the relevance of the material disseminated as perceived by the target audience. Similarly, and in particular with newer technologies, the ability to interact with the information was an important facet of the effective information dissemination process. Underlying these concepts, however, is the need for an understanding of information seeking styles. Miller and Mangan's (<a href= "#Miller">1983</a>) two styles of information seeking, <em>monitors,</em> who actively seek out information when threatened with an adverse event, and <em>blunters</em>, who ignore the event by distracting themselves, have obvious implications for the effectiveness of any information dissemination strategy. Barriers and constraints to effective dissemination were noted in a number of the studies. These barriers tended to be either cultural in nature, for example taboos regarding sex, or socio-economic, for example <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>levels. </p>

<p>The final concept identified related to the information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>itself and whether the information disseminated was <span>founded</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>upon existing research and, therefore, reinforced the recipients existing knowledge.</p>

<p>Extracting these concepts from the studies illustrated that the accounts were comparable and that synthesis and analysis was achievable. The next stage of the process was the translation of these key concepts.</p>

<h2>Translation </h2>

<p>The real contribution of the synthesis is in determining how the key factors fit together and translate into effective dissemination. The first step in this process was to determine how the factors identified relate to each other with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to effective information dissemination. There are two parties to the dissemination process, the information provider and the information recipient, and it was in relation to these two <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that the factors were first <span>divided</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Listing the concepts with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to whether they related to the information provider or recipient, clarified that within each category the factors could be further defined as internal or external to each of the <span>roles</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The recipient's recognition of the need for new knowledge, for example, was internal to that individual, whilst evidence of their involvement in any dissemination strategy was readily available to the information provider. On the part of the information provider, although the cultural constraints and socio-economic barriers to effective information dissemination were applicable to many circumstances the evaluation process was specific to their particular strategy. Displaying the factors in a diagram illustrates these divisions (Figure 1). </p>

<div align="center"><img src="p178fig1.gif" width="465" height="305" alt="fig1" /></div>
<br />
<div align="center">Figure 1: Factors influencing effective dissemination.</div>

<p>The diagram displays how the factors relate to each other, but to translate these factors into effective dissemination it is necessary to determine the pattern behind the relationships. Finding the pattern required con0eration of the theoretical underpinnings of the studies. All of the studies were <span>founded</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>upon one of the following theories:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Diffusion of innovation theory.</li>
<li>Social <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>theory.</li>
<li>Social marketing.</li>
</ul></blockquote>



<p>As the theories are not mutually exclusive and share many <span>characteristics</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> a number of the studies included elements of more than one theory in their research <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and evaluation. </p>

<p>Con0eration of the factors displayed in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>1, in relation to the theories outlined above, highlighted that no one factor was <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for effective dissemination. Indeed, it was not possible to create a hierarchy of factors because it was the <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of factors that was important for effective dissemination. The <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>theories, however, not only provide the <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>between the internal and external factors, but also between the <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of information provider and information recipient. Three concepts from the theories have a <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or indirect relationship with all of the other factors. These concepts are:</p>

<blockquote>
<ol type="1|2|">
<li>The willingness of the recipient to accept new knowledge.</li>
<li>Targeting information for a specific audience.</li>
<li>The role of opinion leaders.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<div align="center"><img src="p178fig2.gif" width="583" height="364" alt="fig2" /></div>
<br />
<div align="center">Figure 2: How the concepts link together</div>

<p>All of the factors must be con0ered as elements of an integrated whole rather than each in isolation. For the information provider, therefore, the dissemination method should be matched to the target audience, opinion leaders should be identified and utilised as a resource in the strategy, and the optimum conditions for acceptance of the new knowledge can be created by <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>participants in the process. Similarly, for the information recipient the perceived relevance of the material can be <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by the opinion leaders, information targeted at them should <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>their cultural and socio-economic <span>backgrounds</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with the information will positively affect their willingness to change behaviour or <span>attitudes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>One of the studies in the review illustrates these <span>links</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The study was an evaluation of communication <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>employed by management during the incorporation of a college of health care studies as a new faculty of a university (Whitaker, <em>et al.</em>, <a href= "#Whitaker">1994</a>). The management employed six different methods of dissemination ranging from a <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>newsletter to large-scale staff meetings with workshops <em>( matching method with audience),</em> one-to-one meetings with senior managers were available <em>(opinion leaders)</em> and an Incorporation Advisory Group, comprised of staff from all areas at all levels, collected information on issues that worried staff and communicated   management's <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to staff <em>(involving participants in the process).</em> The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>area of <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for the staff in this <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>related to their posts in the new structure. The newsletter and Advisory Group were rated the most useful communication methods by the staff. The newsletter <span>contained</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>personnel information as posts were filled in addition to <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the progress of the incorporation <em>(reflecting the cultural and economic background).</em> The advisory group was set up to channel staff <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to the decision-making groups; communication between the two groups was rapid and perceived as helpful <em>(interaction with the information).</em> Finally, although staff rated the opportunity of one-to-one meetings as beneficial, these were not greatly utilised. The researchers <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that the offer of the senior managers' time could be perceived as evidence that that the management was prepared to take the trouble to listen to the <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of staff <em>(influence of opinion leaders).</em> This study illustrates how con0eration of the elements highlighted by the review can result in effective dissemination. </p>

<h2>Applying the model</h2>

<h3>Targeting information</h3>

<p>The model of effective information dissemination thus produced was employed as a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for the evaluation of the information dissemination effort during the suspected TB incident. The key factors highlighted by the review informed both the interview guide and <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>coding and categorisation of data from interviews with key informants, and also the drafting and <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis of questionnaires distributed amongst the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>The dissemination process during the suspected TB incident <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a classical, centralized diffusion system model, whereby information is &quot;diffused as a <span>uniform</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>package&quot; (Freimuth, <a href ="#Freimuth">1987</a>). Adoption of this model suggested that targeting information to the requirements of the various audiences in the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>was less likely to <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>than would be the case with a less hierarchical diffusion model. The potential audiences for the information disseminated during the incident were many and varied. The <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>involved in the incident included such diverse groups as school-age <span>children</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> elderly re0ents and individuals whose first language was not <span>English</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Providing information to such diverse groups presents a challenge to any information provider, providing information to these diverse groups during a crisis would be particularly challenging. </p>

<p>School <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were at the heart of the crisis in the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> As well as being the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the TB screening process, the <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were also the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>delivery <span>mechanism</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for information, at least in the initial stages of the crisis. The information providers did acknowledge that <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were a potential audience, however, no specific measures were taken to target information for this particular audience. Information providers <span>justified</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>these actions with their <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>would receive information from their parents during the incident. The responses to the <span>children</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>s questionnaires, however, highlighted that <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were just as likely to be informed by the media coverage of the crisis, as they were by receiving information <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>from their parents. Elderly re0ents might also have been con0ered a potential audience for information during the crisis. Although the initial delivery <span>mechanism</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for the newsletters, via the local <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>children, was later modified in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to demand from the <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> no other measures were specifically employed to target information for this audience. Analysis of <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>data, however, indicated that elderly re0ents in the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>did not <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the information relevant to their circumstances.</p>

<p>One group within the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>who did <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>specific measures were those individuals for whom <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>was their second language. For this group, neither formal written communications, requiring a high level of literacy in <span>English</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> nor telephone support, requiring reasonably sophisticated verbal communication skills, were appropriate methods of information dissemination. The <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that individuals requiring further information were able to use the contact telephone number created an unnecessary barrier between the information provider and the <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>information recipient.</p>

<h3>Opinion leaders</h3>

<p>Diffusion research suggests that the role of opinion leaders is to persuade rather than to inform, whilst social <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>theory contends that the importance of opinion leaders is in their 'modelling' of appropriate behaviour (Bandura, <a href= "#Bandura">1986</a>). 'Modelled behaviour' was demonstrated in this study. Health officials, for example, informed the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that they, too, were personally affected by the abnormal <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>results. The 'modelled behaviour' was to adhere to the medication programme, despite the increasing uncertainty over the initial diagnosis of a TB infection. The questionnaire responses indicated that opinion leaders did persuade the respondents to accept the information, of which they had previously been informed in the newsletters.</p>

<p>An important aspect of the role of opinion leaders in the dissemination of information is the concept of homophilous communication, whereby communication between individuals sharing similar attributes is more effective than that between heterophilous individuals, whose attributes are dissimilar.</p>

<p>The heterophilous nature of communication between the health professionals and individuals who did not share the same attributes also suggests that the individuals might have identified other persons to fulfil the role of opinion leader. Communication between the <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>involved in the crisis and the formal information providers was especially heterophilous. In addition, those respondents in this study whose first language was not <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>identified a number of potential opinion leaders in the <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> on the basis of their shared <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and attributes in relation to the respondent and the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that they faced. </p>

<p>These <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that whilst opinion leaders are an important element of an effective information dissemination strategy, heterophilous communication can create barriers between information providers and information recipients.</p>

<h3>Willingness to accept new knowledge</h3>

<p>The remaining factor in the model of effective information dissemination explored in relation to the crisis was the concept of the information recipient's willingness to accept new knowledge. In particular the research explored the impact of the individual's information seeking <span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>upon the effectiveness of the information dissemination process. </p>

<p>Analysis of the key informant interview data identified an <span>assumption</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> on the part of the information providers, that not seeking information was an indication that recipients' were satisfied with the information provided. Miller and Mangan's (<a href= "#Miller">1983</a>) research, however, demonstrates that individual's may adopt an information blunting strategy towards a crisis, thereby choosing not to actively seek information. This does not, however, <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that individuals adopting this information behaviour strategy are <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>satisfied with the information they have already received. Indeed, the <span>opposite</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>may be true. Brashers, <em>et al.</em>, (<a href= "#Brashers">2002</a>) contend, for example, that an individual might adopt an information blunting strategy when there is a <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that new information will <span>conflict</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with their existing health <span>beliefs</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Analysis of the questionnaire data indicated that the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>respondents included both information monitors and information blunters, and that con0eration of information seeking styles was an important element of an effective information dissemination strategy. </p>

<h2>A model of effective information dissemination in a crisis</h2>

<p>Employing the model of effective information dissemination derived from the systematic review as a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for the evaluation of the dissemination of information during the suspected TB incident confirmed that the three linking factors were relevant. Exploration of these elements of the model, however, also highlighted that two further elements should be incorporated in the model. These two elements are the barriers to effective information dissemination created by information providers' assumptions about their audience and the need for homophilous communication. The resulting model of effective information dissemination in a crisis is displayed in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>3.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The model of effective information dissemination in a crisis, in conceptualising effective information dissemination as a process <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>both the information provider and information recipient, contrasts with the traditional expert to lay-person model of risk communication. The anticipated outcome of any information strategy is twofold&mdash;an informed audience <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with the optimum use of resources. As the model above illustrates, there are five elements that <span>ought</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to be particularly con0ered in a dissemination strategy.  Con0eration of these elements, however, has implications for information providers, which go beyond the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>dissemination process. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>commitment to targeting information to a specific audience, for example, involves gathering a <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>amount of information about the <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>recipients before dissemination takes place. Employing market segmentation techniques will help information providers to understand their target audience, thus enabling them to make more <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>predictions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot;...which in turn are prerequisites to the ability to influence outcomes.&quot; (Kotler, <em>et al.,</em> <a href="#Kotler">1989</a>). Employing market segmentation techniques, however, invariably highlights the need to adopt a multi-method dissemination strategy.</p>

<p>Identification of the role of opinion leaders in the dissemination strategy <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that information providers should be aware of those individuals who might perform this function in a particular <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The benefits for information providers in identifying opinion leaders are <span>con0erable</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> as,</p>

<blockquote>...the opinions and behaviour of those who <span>possess</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>status and prestige are likely to have a greater impact upon what spreads through a social <span>network</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> than the activities modelled by peripheral members. (Bandura, <a href="#Bandura">1986</a>).</blockquote>

<p>Knowledge of the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is a key aspect of social marketing, where the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the approach is upon market analysis (knowing the environment), market segmentation (targeting the <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>audience) and market strategy. The model constructed in this research project suggests that the social marketing approach to information dissemination should be a core element of <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and training for information professionals. Educators in the field of information studies should ensure that practitioners are trained not only to gather data about the target audience but also to manipulate the data to allow them to define their target audience accurately. Practitioners will thus be armed with the necessary <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to ensure maximum benefit for their audience for the optimum use of the information providers' resources.</p>

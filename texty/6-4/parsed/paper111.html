<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This paper is based on a study commissioned to scope the work of the scholarly communications group (SCG) of the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) of the UK Higher Education Funding Councils. The mission of the SCG is 'To make a leading contribution to the <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and implementation of sustainable and cost-effective emerging behaviours across the various aspects of the scholarly communication process, on behalf of the UK educational and research communities, and in collaboration with relevant national and international partners'. The SCG supplied the terms of <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>for the study. In essence, the purpose of the study was to outline the criteria for defining what is a 'scholarly publication' (see <a href="#app1">Appendix 1</a>). </p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>The study <span>consisted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of desk research supplemented by the responses to a questionnaire (<a href="#app2">Appendix 2</a>; hereafter <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to as the questionnaire) of library and publisher representatives and of researchers of scholarly communication. The questionnaire was distributed to all sixteen members of the SCG and to nine non-members on 31 January 2001. All recipients are actively involved in reviewing and developing scholarly communication <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and thus are well informed about the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of the study. Those who are not members of the SCG were selected to contribute expert opinion from <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the library <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and from the USA. The questionnaire was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to be provocative, with a view to exploring respondents' opinions as well as gathering information. The schedule for the study was very tight and responses were requested within <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>days of receipt of the questionnaire. Eight responses were received; six from members of the SCG and two from non-members. All respondents were UK-based. They included three librarians, one publisher representative, two academic researchers, and two higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>administrators. Where appropriate, their responses are identified as L1, L2, L3, P1, R1, R2, A1 and A2 <span>respectively</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>While the <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>rate to the questionnaire was very low, at 32%, it was felt that the persons involved were <span>influential</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in the field of scholarly communication generally, played a significant role in the <span>representation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of this subject to the Joint Information Systems Committee, and, therefore, presented views that could usefully illuminate the desk research. The data have been used in this way, rather than being presented as the results of a stand-alone <span>survey</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>"</p>

<h2>Scholarly communication</h2>

<p>The <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>'scholarship' is defined, for the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of the UK research assessment exercise (RAE) as:</p>

<blockquote>the creation, development and maintenance of the intellectual infrastructure of subjects and disciplines, in forms such as dictionaries, scholarly editions, catalogues and <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>research databases (<a href="#ref2">Higher Education Funding Councils, 2001</a>).</blockquote>

<p>Thus, the end products of scholarship are publicly available information objects. The <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>'intellectual infrastructure' also implies formality and permanence. </p>

<p>Scholarship is not an activity undertaken in isolation. Borgman explained that 'Scholarship is inherently a social process… research in all fields is incomplete until it is validated through review processes and shared with others'. Thus, scholarship <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>involves communication. The <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>scholarly communication <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>not to an output but to an iterative process in which scholarship is communicated, used and developed within a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#ref2">Kling &amp; McKim, 1999</a>). Borgman defined and described scholarly communication as 'how scholars in any field… use and disseminate information through formal and informal channels' (<a href="#ref1">Borgman, 1990</a>: 13-14) but other writers commonly equate scholarly communication with a narrow <span>segment</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of scholarly output, <span>namely</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>scholarly articles <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span><span>ultimately</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>for publication in journals or similar formats (e.g., <a href="#ref1">Alexander &amp; Goodyear, 2000</a>; <a href="#ref1">Bowen, 1996</a>; <a href="#ref1">Buck, <i>et al.</i></a>, 1999; <a href="#ref2">Graham, 2000</a>; <a href="#ref3">Odlyzko, 1999</a>; <a href="#ref3">Okerson, 1998</a>; <a href="#ref3">Rohe, 1998</a>; <a href="#ref3">Scarry, 1999</a>; and <a href="#ref3">Sosteric, 1998</a>). This is explicable in that it generally <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>within the context of a discussion of the 'crisis' in scholarly communication which <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to library costs associated largely with increased subscription <span>charges</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of scholarly journals. </p>

<p>For the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of this paper, the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>'scholarship' is used in a wider sense so the end products of scholarship would include but would not be <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to journal articles that report original <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>research, review papers and opinion papers, monographs, multi-contributor editions, <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and databases. It is not <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that this definition be restricted to specific media. The rate and way in which emerging media are used for scholarly communication will vary across scholarly communities. Whether a particular application is appropriate is best <span>judged</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>by those communities (see, <a href="#ref1">Covi, 2000</a>; <a href="#ref2">Hurd, 2000</a>; <a href="#ref2">Kling &amp; McKim, 2000</a>; and <a href="#ref2">McCain, 2000</a>).</p>

<p>Graham <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the scholarly communication process into three stages: communication within informal networks, which now <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>largely through the use of electronic media (see, <a href="#ref2">Gabbay,  2000</a>); the initial public dissemination of research through conferences and preprints; and finally, formal publication in 'prestigious journals' (<a href="#ref2">Graham, 2000</a>). Graham <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the potential output of scholarly communication to publication in prestigious journals. This paper is concerned with a wider <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of outputs. <span>Nevertheless</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> Graham's definition is useful for exploring the process of scholarly communication and con0ering the value of different types of information objects at different points on the continuum. </p>

This reflects the conceptual blurring of informal and formal <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of communication in an electronic <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span><span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to by Meadows in 1998. He defined informal <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of communication as, 'often ephemeral and… made available to a restricted audience only' and formal <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>as, 'typically available over long periods of time to an <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>audience'. He identified journals and books as 'archetypical examples of formal communications' (<a href="#ref2">Meadows, 1998</a>: ix). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>contribution to an electronic discussion <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>with a substantial, international membership illustrates how electronic media blur this distinction. The message may be forwarded to numerous other forums and may be available in an archive of the discussion for a 'long <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of time' yet few analysts would currently define it as a 'formal communication'. <span>Nevertheless</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> a record of the informal discussion of an 'invisible college' may be deemed valuable to scholarship. The facility to capture that discussion <span>raises</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the question of its <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>within the scholarly communication continuum and whether or not it is sufficiently valuable to warrant investment that ensures its preservation and long-term accessibility. </p>

<p>The distinction between formal and informal communication formats is more difficult when a document is <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>as a permanent record of research. Examples include conference proceedings, preprints, theses, reports, journal articles, and monographs. All but the latter two are categorised as 'grey' in a print <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>because they can be difficult for users to identify and to access. The electronic <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>makes these more accessible, thus <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>them further along a scholarly publication continuum. Formats that are 'grey' in a print <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>may, in an electronic <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> fulfil some of the functions of a scholarly publication more effectively than the archetypical formats to which Meadows <span>referred</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> For example, it may be argued that an electronic preprint archive is a more effective vehicle for timely communication and for <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>chronological priority than a scholarly journal. <span>Nevertheless</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> most preprints posted on <strong>arXivX</strong> (<a href="#ref2">Los Alamos National Laboratory, 2001</a>), the biggest and best-established preprint archive are also submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals (<a href="#ref3">Smith, 2001</a>) indicating that an electronic preprint does not fulfil all of the publication needs of the author. The fact that readers in subjects well served by preprint archives are reluctant to forgo access to journals suggests also that preprints do not fulfil all needs of the reader (<a href="#ref2">Mah&eacute; <i>et al.</i>, 2000</a>; <a href="#ref3">Smith, 2001</a>). </p>

<p>Electronic preprints exemplify the use of ICT to distribute a format that existed previously in print as a draft of a scholarly journal article. New technologies however, are facilitating the development of <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of communicating scholarship and recording that communication that have no print analogue and cannot readily be accommodated by existing scholarly publishing <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#ref2">Lynch, 1999</a>). Examples that already have a significant impact on scholarly communities are scientific databases of the size and scope of GenBank and the Protein Information Resource (<a href="#ref2">McCain, 2000</a>) and collaborative, evolving resources such as subject-specific web sites that combine access to <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>source materials, analysis and commentary (<a href="#ref2">Lynch, 1999</a>). More complex examples are collaboratories described by Lynch as:</p>

<blockquote>Environments [that] variously combine videoconferencing, synchronous and asynchronous text-based messaging, shared control of scientific instrumentation, access to data (from <span>observational</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>sensors, simulations, or data archives), analysis and visualisation <span>tools</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> shared whiteboards, literature databases, and authoring <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#ref2">Lynch, 1999</a>).</blockquote>

<p>Lynch explained that: </p>

<blockquote>These <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>also document the research and knowledge creation process … it's important to note that events and activities that take place in these collaboratories can be stored, reviewed, replayed and annotated (<a href="#ref2">Lynch, 1999</a>).</blockquote>

<p>These are examples of new formats for recording scholarly communication that present problems of <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and organisation, certification and validation, <span>acquisition</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> and preservation. For example, Lynch stated that:</p>

<blockquote>the materials involved are not only dynamic but also <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>complex, interlinked and autonomously evolving works, which present <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>conceptual challenges to traditional descriptive <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#ref2">Lynch 1999</a>).</blockquote>

<p>Clearly, scholarly communication and scholarly publication in the 21<sup>st</sup> century cannot be <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>exclusively with <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to or through analogy to print <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>but all stakeholders <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>between informal communication and formal communication or publication. This <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>a flexible definition that can be applied to emerging formats. </p>

<h3>Characteristics of a scholarly publication</h3>

<p>The questionnaire distributed for this study asked respondents to select the necessary and <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>criteria for a definition of scholarly publication. None of the suggested criteria was selected by all respondents. P1 refused to answer Question 1 and only R2 and L2 selected a single necessary criterion. These were that 'the relevant <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>is notified of [the document's] existence' (R2) and that 'it be refereed to ensure <span>quality</span>' <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> (L2). Of the remaining five respondents, four or more con0ered it <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that the document be: durably recorded on some medium; reliably accessible and retrievable over time; and publicly available. Three or more con0ered it <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that there be a commitment not to withdraw it; and that the author intends that the work be made publicly available over the long <span>term</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> Four or more of the remaining five respondents also con0ered it unnecessary that a scholarly publication be immutable; accessible by readers at any <span>reasonable</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>time of day; be covered by at least one abstracting and indexing service; be equal to or longer than a minimum length; have publicly available metadata describing the work; and have guaranteed, long-term archival preservation. Three or more con0ered it unnecessary that the information object reports the result of original research. Although there was no consensus on the specific <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of a scholarly publication, the criteria that respondents to the questionnaire con0ered most important generally relate to the accessibility of a publication (see conclusion).</p>

<h3>Functions of a scholarly publication</h3>

<p>Two recent journal articles are useful for exploring the definition of 'scholarly publication'. The first is a paper produced by an international working group (IWG) of publishers and representatives from the higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>community that convened in 1999 on behalf of the International Association of STM Publishers to 'develop a position paper on how to define a scientific paper in the electronic era' (<a href="#ref2">International Working Group, 2000</a>). The second is an analytical approach to scholarly electronic publishing that explores that concept with <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to the three 'dimensions' of scholarly publication as a 'communicative practice within a <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> (<a href="#ref2">Kling &amp; McKim, 1999</a>). The first of these papers <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>exclusively to scholarly articles or research papers but is useful also for exploring the definition of scholarly publishing in a wider sense. For the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of this paper, no <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>is made about the <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>or format of scholarly publications. </p>

<p>The IWG definition of 'publication' was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to 'assist the orderly development of scientific knowledge'. It acknowledged a continuum of scholarly communication formats in a networked <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>attempted</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to identify the most important 'fixed points' so that the <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of information can be clarified. The IWG aimed to <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>between informal communication and publication and outlined the following as criteria for qualification as the latter: </p>

<ul>
<li>It must be publicly available. </li>
<li>The relevant <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>must be made aware of its existence. </li>
<li>A system for long-term access and retrieval must be in place (e.g. Handle (<a href="#ref1">Corporation for National Research Initiatives, 2001</a>)). </li>
<li>It must not be changed (technical protection and/or certification are desirable). </li>
<li>It must not be removed (unless legally unavoidable). </li>
<li>It must be unambiguously identified (e.g. by a Serial Item and Contribution Identifier (SICI) (<a href="#ref3">University of California, Berkeley. <em>Sun SITE</em>, 2001</a>) or Digital Object Identifier (<a href="#ref2">International DOI Foundation, 2001</a>). </li>
<li>It must have a bibliographic record (metadata) <span>containing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>certain minimal information. </li>
<li>Archiving and long-term preservation must be provided for.</li></ul>

<p>The IWG con0ered <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that fail to fulfil these criteria as 'not published' and thus not <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>for citation or as the basis of claims of priority or professional evaluation. It outlined in detail the criteria for identification as a 'first publication' and those for a 'definitive publication'. Essentially, the former becomes the latter when it has been evaluated and certified by the author's peers. </p>

<p>The IWG definition arises from what the group perceived to be the function of scientific publication.</p>

<blockquote>Publication is the hard currency of science. It is the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>yardstick for <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>priority of discovery, making the <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of a publication a critical factor in resolving priority disputes or intellectual property claims. Academic tenure and promotion decisions are based in large part on publication in peer reviewed journals or scholarly books. To make these decisions fairly and with confidence, scientists and their institutions need assurances of what counts as a legitimate publication. The <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of a published electronic document is critical in determining the trust that fellow scientists will have in it … scientists need to know the <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information they encounter, whether they need to refer to it, critique it, or build on it to advance their own work. The document also needs to persist since in science identifying a clear context for later responses is <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and integrity of <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>scientific discourse. (<a href="#ref2">International Working Group, 2000</a>)</blockquote>

<p>This definition emphasises the certified record and its role in career advancement at least as much as the communicative function of a document. Whilst acknowledging the other functions, Kling and McKim explored the concept of scholarly publishing as 'a communicative practice within a <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> i.e. 'an activity engaged in by scholars who primarily want their reports to be widely read and credited by their target audience' (<a href="#ref2">Kling &amp; McKim, 1999</a>). Kling and McKim's <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>on <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> authors and target audience emphasised use as much as production. They framed scholarly communication as a social process rather than a production process. They conceptualised 'effective publication' with <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to three 'dimensions' which serve both authors and readers: publicity, access, and trustworthiness. </p>

<p>Trustworthiness is determined primarily by peer review but also by the reputation of the publisher, by the reader's knowledge of the researcher (<a href="#ref2">Kling &amp; McKim. 1999</a>) and the reputation of the researcher's institution, and, in the case of journal publication, the reputation of the journal title. <span>Sometimes</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> the <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of research funding is also an indication of trustworthiness. Research funded by, for example, a pharmaceutical company may be less credible than publicly-funded research (<a href="#ref1">Borgman, 2000</a>). In non-reviewed or weakly-reviewed outlets, the reputation of the author may be relatively more important (<a href="#ref2">Kling &amp; McKim, 1999</a>). For example, it has been suggested that people using e-print archives tend to read only papers by authors whom they know by reputation (<a href="#ref2">Lesk, 1997</a>). This <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>indicates that trustworthiness arises from a <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of institutionalised <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and the reader's personal knowledge (<a href="#ref2">Kling &amp; McKim, 1999</a>). In the absence of the former, researchers must rely on the latter.</p>

<p>Publicity <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to which 'primary and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>audiences are made aware of [the information object's] availability'. Access means that an information object 'can be readily located and obtained by interested scholars' in perpetuity. The minimum requirement for access is that it has a stable identifier (<a href="#ref2">Kling &amp; McKim, 1999</a>). Also 'long-term, stable accessibility <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>active stewardship, and is more <span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to the extent that stewardship is institutionalised' (Task <span>Force</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>on Archiving of Digital Information 1996 cited in <a href="#ref2">Kling &amp; McKim, 1999</a>). Publication that may <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>on goodwill and the voluntary <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of individuals does not instil confidence in authors (see <a href="#ref2">Gomes &amp; Meadows, 1998</a>). </p>

<p>Using this analysis as a <span>framework</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> it is clear that some formats from the scholarly communication process are more effectively published in an electronic <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>than in print. For example, most of the respondents to the questionnaire agreed that the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>'grey literature' <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that are difficult to identify and access. In recent years, a variety of formats that, in print, were 'grey', for example, theses, preprints, research reports, and conference proceedings, have been made more accessible by being posted on the Internet. This reduces geographical barriers for those with access to the Internet but stable access over time is not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>guaranteed. This <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>institutionalised stewardship. The trustworthiness of formerly 'grey' resources <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>not to be improved by electronic availability. While theses and some research reports are subject to <span>rigorous</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>peer review, preprints, by their nature, have yet to be reviewed; the delivery <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>does not change this. The <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of publicity for these materials varies. <span>Preprint</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>archives such as <strong>arXivX</strong> (<a href="#ref2">Los Alamos National Laboratory, 2001</a>) provide services for alerting users of all new submissions on a weekly basis. Databases of electronic theses and research reports, for example, the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (<a href="#ref3">2001</a>; <a href="#ref1">Fox, 1999</a>), often do not provide current awareness services. Publicity may also be improved by intermediary services such as subject-based gateways that index the Internet. Thus, while access to these 'grey' <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>is improved in the electronic <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> none fulfils Kling and McKim's three criteria for 'effective publication'. </p>

<p>Kling and McKim's <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>suggests that, in a print <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> to communicate research results most effectively to readers within a scholarly <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> an author should <span>publish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in one of Meadows's archetypical formal communication formats. While other formats on the continuum fulfil one or two of Kling and McKim's 'dimensions', printed scholarly journal articles and monographs fulfil all three. In an electronic <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> the <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of scholarly journals and monographs need not change as long as they reach a substantial proportion of the targeted audience and there is an institutional commitment to preserve and archive these formats over the long <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#ref2">Kling &amp; McKim, 1999</a>). Clearly, the electronic <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>facilitates publication in a wider <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of media. This is likely to result in greater variety of formal formats. This paper cannot predict what these formats will be but Kling and McKim's <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>is useful for determining the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to which a new or adapted format is a scholarly publication or formal communication. The remit of the IWG was significantly different from that of Kling and McKim but its definition of a publication observes Kling and McKim's dimensions.</p>

<p>Together these <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>explore the functions of scholarly publications and identify the <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>by which these functions are fulfilled. In a print <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> these functions tend to have been fulfilled best by <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that are published and distributed by <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>publishers. In an electronic <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> this need not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>be the case. The <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>facilitates analysis of the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to which 'alternative' formats are 'scholarly publications' and thus is useful for identifying the means by which these formats may be supplemented to promote their <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to that of 'scholarly publications', that is, <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that meet all of the publication needs of scholarly communities. </p>

<h3>A continuum of publishing formats</h3>

<p>The <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of formats that, in a print <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> were grey, and the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and manner to which these conform to a definition of scholarly publication, vary. What they still have in common is the fact that, regardless of their relative <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>on a continuum of scholarly publications, these formats are all <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the basis of formal publications; journal articles and monographs. Thus, initiatives that make grey literature more accessible <span>duplicate</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the efforts of scholarly publishers to varying degrees. The two formats overlap on the continuum of scholarly publications.</p>

<p>Publication in a second format is useful only to the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that this fulfils functions not fulfilled by the first. For example, electronic preprint publication may be most effective for timely communication and for <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>chronological priority while publication in a peer reviewed journal is required for certification (<a href="#ref2">Harnad, 1999a</a>, <a href="#ref2">1999b</a>; <a href="#ref3">Smith, 2001</a>). Where the extent and structure of formats is similar, for example, as for preprints and journal articles, or for theses and monographs, it may be more efficient to supplement the functions of the service delivering the informal format so that it fulfils Kling and McKim's criteria for 'effective publication' than to <span>duplicate</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>publication formats. A1, A2, and R2 (above) con0ered this possible with <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to eprint archives.</p>

<blockquote>A1: The absence of scholarly journals need not equate with the absence of peer reviewing processes. Similarly, the organisation of e-print archives could readily replace the function of journal titles in guiding academics to relevant <span>bodies</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of work. Indeed, they may offer <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>advantages in assisting academic inquiry though the opportunity to develop more effective <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span><span>tools</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A2: <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>well-designed, authoritatively run, e-print archive with peer review and indexed by appropriate <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>sources could <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>replace and expand the communication function of scholarly journals by widening the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of potential readers (third world, small institutions, researchers for whose institutions the journal would not be mainstream etc.).</blockquote>

<p>A2's <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>implies that an e-print archive would <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>be available to institutions that cannot currently afford to subscribe to related journals. Clearly, this <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>on the economic model on which the development, maintenance and delivery of the e-print archive is based. </p>

<p>While not all functions related to the publication of a scholarly format need be the responsibility of a single agency, it would be inefficient to disaggregate and distribute functions in a manner that results in unnecessary <span>duplication</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of effort. In instances where the format of an information object is significantly altered for <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>publication, for example, where the content of a thesis is the basis of a journal article, both <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>may be useful. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>thesis is much longer and more <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>than the journal article. While most readers prefer the content distilled to article <span>length</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> a subset of them is often interested in the detail.</p>

<p>The IWG con0ered it <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that a reader of one format be aware of the existence of another. Questionnaire respondents agreed that this is important but did not <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>it <span>essential</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> It can be <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>most effectively through creation, maintenance and dissemination of <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and comprehensive metadata (<a href="#ref2">International Working Group, 2000</a>). When versions are created and published by different <span>bodies</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> for example, <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and publishers, responsibility for maintaining <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>metadata about all versions is not clear. The IWG con0ered it an institutional responsibility rather than the responsibility of individual authors. Generally, questionnaire respondents con0ered this the responsibility of the publisher but in the case of pre-prints, two of them (L1 and L2) said that the author should be responsible. R2 con0ers the responsibility to lie with 'The owner or maintainer of the <span>origin</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>or <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>page of any version of the data'. These responses imply distributed metadata about different versions rather than a single file detailing all versions. R1 recognised this and suggested that <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and useful metadata will be rare in <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and L3 suggested that this may be a role for the information professions.</p>

<blockquote>R1: This is where the publisher can really add value. The publisher could have as part of their value-adding process, the addition of consistent metadata. If publishers no longer are active or cannot invest in this <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of thing, it <span>ought</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to be the author, but whether authors will do it reliably is a very moot point. I think we're going to have some pretty crude searching going on. I think good metadata will exist for a minority of items. For the majority, you'll just have to do some pretty crude, free-text searching.</blockquote>

<blockquote>L3: I cannot see authors producing standardised metadata, except in a closed <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> This may be a task for 'library-type' staff or for indexers such as usually work for <span>abstract</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and indexing services (though this would have cost implications).</blockquote> 

<h3>Networked communication and publishing formats</h3>

<p>The networked <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>has the potential to change the structure and format of scholarly publication, for example, by facilitating development of <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>through more dynamic <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>between researchers and through interlinking. Several respondents <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>with <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that are made public initially and revised in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to feedback.</p>

<blockquote>R2: If done in a timely manner, that is, as soon as possible after the research has been done, [the facility to append comments to a scholarly work] has very profound implications to improve the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of dialogue and thus of research. It is important to note that it is this <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of timeliness that's new, and by association the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of informality in feedback. The <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to stimulate immediate feedback and debate on formal papers needs to be crafted very carefully. It is not enough to be electronic.</blockquote>

<blockquote>L1: This potentially makes publications more dynamic… the whole concept of a stable publication in the way that we've known it in a print <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>could, potentially, be undermined… I think the number of different versions of a publication is the biggest implication here.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A1: Intention by the author to disseminate the work in a durable form is certainly highly desirable and should be regarded as best practice in scholarly communication. However, it would be unfortunate if this were to constrain more interactive or developmental forms of publication where work is published in order to attract comment and discussion with a view to a <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>definitive version. The two are not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>incompatible provided that the purpose of the publication is clearly articulated and that that purpose is retained along with the item itself.</blockquote>

<p>Networked communication also facilitates collaboration and discussion on a much broader scale than was possible in a print <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>This presents the potential for 'community-authored' information objects whose <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and function must be accommodated within scholarly communication <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<h4>The effect of networked communication on the definition of a scholarly journal</h4>

<p>It has been suggested that the journal format is a consequence of the technology used, that is, printing (<a href="#ref1">Barry &amp; Richardson, 1997</a>). This suggestion would be contested by publishers who <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>the format to be functionally important, that is,. they <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>a journal title to be a 'brand' that carries a number of messages about the subject and value of the content published therein (<a href="#ref1">Bide, 1997</a>; <a href="#ref2">Morris, 1998</a>). Question 3 in the questionnaire proposed the following definition of a scholarly journal and invited respondents to comment:</p>

<blockquote>A scholarly journal functions to communicate, validate and certify, to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>priority, to contextualise research within a specific field through citation of earlier work, and as a formal record of research results. It also filters the best and most relevant content in a specific field. </blockquote>

<p>To this definition, P1 added:</p>

<blockquote>(a) branding – collecting together articles in a recognisable 'envelope' which conveys signals of both relevance and <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> and (b) quantity control – obvious in print but also important electronically. The journal (in most cases – not quite all!) selects a quantity of material which the reader can <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>cope with.</blockquote>

<p>The suggestion that journal titles are useful for controlling quantity makes a <span>virtue</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of the need to control the number of pages in print. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>print journal receiving a <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of submissions that it cannot accommodate increases the rejection rate by revising editorial policy. Thus, high <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>content that may otherwise be <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>is rejected. This is not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>a positive contribution to scholarly publication. While readers need effective <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>for navigating and filtering published content, all high-quality research deserves effective publication. R2's <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to question 3 in the questionnaire is apposite here. S/he said:</p>

<blockquote>The <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>function of a journal is to package and market a body of work. You can imbue it with the above <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to varying degrees depending on the nature of the journal you want to market.</blockquote>

<h4>Scholarly journals as brands</h4>

<p>The value to authors and readers of specific titles as brands is contentious and may be greater in some fields than in others. One of the SPARC-supported journals has demonstrated that the principle value of a specific title is related to the editor and editorial board rather than the brand <i>per se.</i> In 1998, the editor of a Kluwer title, <i>Evolutionary Ecology,</i> <span>Michael</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>Rosenzweig, left that journal due to 'indefensible price rises' and launched a competitor title <i>Evolutionary Ecology Research</i> with SPARC support. His editorial board joined him and 90% of authors whose papers awaited publication in the Kluwer journal withdrew them and submitted them <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to <i>Evolutionary Ecology Research </i>which broke even within the first year (<a href="#ref3">Rosenzweig, 1999</a>). </p>

<p>While many publishers insist that journals as brands are important, the electronic publishing <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of the largest commercial scholarly publishers appear to undermine individual journal titles by bundling them together and offering libraries a service rather than a <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of discrete products. This is portrayed as <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>value and apparently offsets librarians' demands for price reductions. The value of the additional content received in a large bundle is unclear and bundling may even support weak titles that otherwise are not viable. Clearly, publisher-added value is <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>paying for only if it valuable to the research <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> R1 expressed this in her/his <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to question 4:

<blockquote>I think publishers should be focusing on adding value and thus being able to justify a price that is acceptable. It is <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>value in terms of the <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of the readers. Unless they can do that the implications are that publishers may get squeezed out.</blockquote> 

<p>The basic functionality of the web also threatens brand awareness. One way in which authors of scholarly publications contextualise their work within a field is through citation. In an electronic <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> citations can be hyperlinked to the cited papers. The culmination of this linking facility was described recently as 'the holy grail for content providers and users alike… a seamless, integrated, transparent <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that allows searchers to link quickly and painlessly to any document they seek' (<a href="#ref2">Grogg &amp; Tenopir, 2000</a>). In a seamlessly integrated, hyperlinked <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> the visibility and, thus, value attached to specific titles is likely to be reduced as readers link from paper to paper without having to first identify the journal in which a cited paper is published.</p>

<h2>Learning scholarly communication</h2>

<p>Scholarly communication <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>are learned within a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#ref1">Covi, 2000</a>; <a href="#ref2">Kling &amp; McKim, 2000</a>). This is important because communities of scholars have developed different ways of resolving issues of legitimacy and trust in traditional media. These <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>are protected when the media are computerised. Value-adding <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>may be appended but the basic legitimising <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>remain intact (<a href="#ref2">Kling &amp; McKim, 2000</a>). For example, the development of a thriving pre-print culture in <span>high-energy</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>physics is related to a variety of <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of that <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that are absent in other disciplines such as <span>chemistry</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#ref3">Till, 2001</a>). Thus, attempts to generalise communication <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>across all disciplines in an electronic <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>may be at best unhelpful and may waste resources spent on attempting to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>new <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in inappropriate disciplines.  Questionnaire respondents were <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>on this issue. Half of them agreed that scholarly communication should not be treated as a homogeneous practice as behaviour varies between communities or disciplines. In contrast, R2's <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>accords roughly with the view that all disciplines can benefit by adopting <span>free</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> open access to pre-prints. A1, A2 and L3 also identified benefits of con0ering issues of 'scholarly communication' as a whole. </p>

<blockquote>A1: Provided variations are remembered, there may, indeed, be benefits in identifying and sharing good practice…Probably, the old 'just because you can do something doesn't mean that you should' applies here. <span>Nevertheless</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> heterogeneity is sometimes used by academics (by no means exclusively) as a cloak for unwillingness or unfamiliarity. Remember the Luddites!</blockquote>

<blockquote>A2: It must be possible and should be the goal to develop <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>which have inbuilt flexibility to allow all disciplines to archive their material in a way <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to their <span>traditions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and way of working, but compatible and interoperable with those f other disciplines – diversity within a common <span>framework</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>L3: I think it is true to a <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that, at present, there is a tendency to see these as a single kind of product, even if some will be discipline-based and others will be institutionally-based. At the same time (a) there is some similarity across many disciplines and a worry about technological <span>determinism</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>should not <span>hold</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>back development, and (b) is the alternative worse? There may be a danger of the paralysis of analysis in this question. As someone said in another context: 'follow the light you have, and pray for more light'. I think we can <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>ahead in this way and at the same time look for other <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in areas where this approach may not be appropriate.</blockquote>

<p>The <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>stakeholders in scholarly publication are authors and readers.

Many researchers as authors support an economic structure that effectively deprives them, as readers, of access to all of the research papers they need. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> as authors, they fuel publication of a <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of content that, as readers, they have <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>managing (<a href="#ref2">Meadows, 1998</a>).

Attempts to address the system-wide problem must include authors.</p>

<p>The point at which scholars learn scholarly communication <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>is the point at which alternative behaviours might best be inculcated. For example, when Virginia Tech imposed mandatory submission of theses and dissertations in electronic form, they used that opportunity to teach postgraduate <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>about the scholarly communication system and to equip them with the skills to create scholarly <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in standardised, electronic form (<a href="#ref1">Fox, 1999</a>). Initiatives directed at postgraduate <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>have the potential routinely to inform a new generation of scholars about the scholarly communication system, the assignment of copyright and related issues and to train them in the production and self-publication of electronic scholarly <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>as they learn scholarly communication <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This paper aimed to provide a working definition of 'scholarly publication'. The <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>provided by Kling and McKim supplemented by the IWG definition and the criteria of questionnaire respondents was used to generate the following definition which <span>divides</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>criteria into those that are: <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>(E); Highly desirable (HD); and preferable (P). Thus, a scholarly publication requires:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trustworthiness</li>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Publications should not be changed (<strong>HD</strong>). </li>
<li>Different versions should be clearly identified (<strong>HD</strong>). </li>
<li>To satisfy all potential interest, trustworthiness should be based on 'institutionalised' measures such as peer review rather than on personal knowledge (<strong>HD</strong>). </li>
<li>Each publication should have at least one identifiable author (<strong>P</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>Publicity</li>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The potential audience must be made aware that the publication exists (<strong>HD</strong>). </li>
<li>The publication should have metadata <span>containing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>a minimum set of information, preferably including information about all versions (<strong>P</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>Accessibility: the document must be readily obtained by those who wish to use it.</li>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The author must intend that the publication be made publicly available in a durable form over the long <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>(<strong>E</strong>). </li>
<li>The publication must be durably recorded on some <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>(<strong>E</strong>). </li>
<li>The publication must be reliably accessible and retrievable over time (<strong>E</strong>) </li>
<li>There should be a commitment not to withdraw the publication (<strong>E</strong>). </li>
<li>The publication must be publicly available, i.e. available to any member of the public on demand as of right, whether for payment of a fee or not. (<strong>E</strong>). </li>
<li>The publication should have stable identifiers (<strong>HD</strong>).</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>The establishment of emerging behaviour as <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that fulfil the functions of scholarly publication <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>that scholars understand how each element in this definition contributes to effective publication. This, in turn, <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>understanding of the whole publication <span>chain</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> If research communities and those that support them are to maximise investment in the <span>chain</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>on this issue should be routinely integrated with <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>on research methods and <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The JISC is seeking to commission a scoping study to clarify what should be encompassed in the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>"scholarly communications" for the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of its Scholarly Communications Group. The remit of this group is to take forward relevant issues relating to electronic journals, e-prints, archiving, IPR, assessment and new publishing <span>paradigms</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> The Group hopes to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>ways to support emerging behaviours, for example by ensuring greater accessibility to information and by making information available in different and new ways. </p>

<p>The discussion paper produced will define the meaning of scholarly communication, by looking at various criteria and <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of how to describe a scholarly publication including: </p>

<li> availability in the public domain</li>
<li> peer recognition</li>
<li> intention of the scholar to publish</li>
<li> costs/potential costs. </li></ul>

<p>1b. Which of the following are <strong>SUFFICIENT</strong> to define something as a scholarly publication?<br>

<p>1c. Please comment on the last two questions. </p>

<p>2. Is it possible to preserve and archive the web of hyperlinks in scholarly publications? What are the implications of this for your definition of scholarly publication?</p>

<h2>Functions of a scholarly journal</h2>

<p>3. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>scholarly journal functions to communicate, validate and certify, to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>priority, to contextualise research within a specific field through citation of earlier work, and as a formal record of research results. It also filters the best and most relevant content in a specific field. Please comment on this <span>description</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<h2>Peer review</h2>

<p>4. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span><span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> of initiatives such as eprint archives and NEAR (National Electronic Archive Repository)  threaten to reduce the publisher role to that of co-ordinating peer review.  Given that price of journals is based on perceived value rather than cost, this may not reduce the price to the scholarly <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> If the price that the scholarly <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>is prepared to pay for peer review is significantly lower than the price currently paid for a journal, co-ordination of peer review may not be commercially viable for publishers. What are the implications for scholarly publishing?</p>

<p>5. Peer review is based on <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>rather than popularity at the time of publication. Papers often remain in the archive unused for years before they are discovered and contribute con0erably to scholarship. Publication based on this <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>process is incompatible with libraries’ desire to purchase only those articles that their users need. Please comment. </p>

<h2>A continuum of scholarly publishing formats</h2>

<p>6. It has been suggested that in the absence of a filtering <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>such as peer review and a journal title, academics using eprint archives read only papers of authors that they know. Can eprint archives replace the communication function of scholarly journals in a research community?</p>

<p>7. Is it appropriate that peer reviewed journal articles cite preprints? Why?</p>

<p>8.  Is it necessary, when accessing the certified, definitive version of a scholarly publication, to know that other versions exist and/or to know the form in which it was first made available to the public?</p>

<p>9. In a print <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>grey literature is difficult to identify and difficult to access. In an electronic <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>research reports, theses and preprints are freely available on the internet and are often indexed by subject-specific portals or by libraries. How grey are these electronic publications?</p>

<p>10a. In an electronic <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>readers may append comments and/or criticisms to scholarly works. What are the implications of this for scholarly publication?</p>

<p>10b. Are these comments and/or criticisms scholarly works, are they elements of the work to which they are appended or neither?</p>

<p>11. Is it possible/desirable to retract work that has been published?</p>

<p>If so, what type of publications should be retractable (e.g. pre-print, conference proceedings, peer-reviewed journal article).</p>

<p>12. What are the implications for scholarly communication of making work available <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>to a global audience (and potentially to mass media) before it has been validated and certified (e.g. as preprints, conference proceedings)? </p>

<p>13. Browsing in a print <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>facilitates serendipitous discovery which may facilitate creativity. Is this facility <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in an electronic <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and, if so, what are the implications for scholarly communication?</p>

<h2>Metadata</h2>

<p>14. Who should be responsible for ensuring that <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and standardised metadata about a publication are publicly available and are altered e.g. when errata are published? (Please refer to different types of publication, e.g. preprints, conference proceedings, grey literature, journal articles).</p>

<h2>Heterogeneous <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>in scholarly communication</h2>

<p>15. Scholarly communication <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>are heterogeneous across disciplines, e.g. some disciplines have a well-developed pre-print culture while others do not, some disciplines rely more heavily than others on conference proceedings to communicate results.  What are the implications for scholarly publishing? Is it useful to <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>scholarly communication and/or scholarly publication as if these are homogenous activities?</p>

<p>16. Initiatives that aim to encourage the development of eprint archives across all STM disciplines <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>technological <span>determinism</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>and fail to recognise heterogeneity across scholarly communities. Please comment.</p>

<h2>Publishing context</h2>

<p>17. In a hyperlinked <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> it is easy to repackage and reposition content by collecting bundles of <span>links</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span> What are the implications of this for authors?</p>

<p>18. The electronic <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>facilitates analysis of use of individual <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>so that most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>used <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:105px 35px 105px 35px;position:relative;">.</span>can be readily identified. It also facilitates collaborative filtering. What are the implications of this for scholarly communication? </p>

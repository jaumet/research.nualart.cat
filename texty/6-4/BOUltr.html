<p>Dear Editor,</p>

<p>My name is <A href="http://www.implicity.com/">David Boulton</A>, I 
have been a learning theorist and educational philosopher for almost 20 years. What I wish to share with you is 
from the heart and for the children who are suffering from reading problems . I have no 
commercial intentions in writing you. My purpose is simply to stimulate your thinking; and perhaps your suggestions. As you know the stakes are enormous - I think you will find what I have to say is 
fresh - please take a few minutes and read me out.</p>

<p>I have placed in this document 3 short pieces of work: An <A href="#abstract">Abstract</A>. An <A href="#Analogy">Analogy</A> that illustrates how we (maybe not you but the public in general) have missed a significant point in our thinking about what's causing our reading problems and a<A href="#article"> short article</A> which explains my proposal. In addition to the information contained in this email, my web site, <A 
href="http://www.implicity.com/reading/">http://www.implicity.com/reading/</A> contains additional
research and a more elaborate unfolding of my thinking.</p>

<P>It seems to me that our most basic information technology - the 'code' we read with needs 
the scrutiny of information scientists such as yourself.</P>

<P>Thank you - David Boulton</P>

<P><A name=abstract><B>Abstract</B></A>The greater the number of ambiguous letter-sounds (and letter-sound combinations) coexistent in a word, the greater the number of iterations of ambiguity reduction required before the word can be virtually-heard or spoken. The greater the number of ambiguity reducing iterations (disambiguations) involved the longer the reader’s attention must stretch to process them. The longer the span of attention required, the greater the vulnerability to miscues in decoding causing drop outs from the decoding-stream-flow-rate necessary to sustain the flow of reading. The single most significant underlying cause for this, <B><I>ambiguity-overwhelm </I>&gt; <I>stutter </I>&gt; <I>drop out,</I></B> is the archaic “<A 
href="http://www.implicity.com/reading/realproblem.htm">technology</A>” we read with. </P>

<P>A 1000-year-old lack of leadership in managing the relationship between the <A href="http://www.implicity.com/reading/twotechs.htm">Latin alphabet and the English spoken language</A> has resulted in a deeply entrenched, convoluted and highly ambiguous ‘code’. <A 
href="http://www.implicity.com/reading/obstacles.htm">Every</A><A 
href="http://www.implicity.com/reading/obstacles.htm"> attempt</A> to change the alphabet or reform spelling - to render their relationship more simply phonetic - has failed. Phonics and phonemic awareness pedagogies are both attempts to compensate for, not directly address, the ambiguities created by the idiomatic 
correspondence of these two systems (the code).</P>

modern font technology it is relatively easy to add another dimension of 
functionality to the concept of a character or letter. Specifically, it is 
possible to print (paper or screen) letters with shape, size, intensity and 
spacing variations that, while retaining unambiguous letter recognition 
features, convey additional information or cues about how the letter sounds in 
the particular word in which it is encountered. &nbsp; <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

am<A href="http://www.implicity.com/reading/proposal.htm"> proposing</A> is that 
a small number of alphabet-general letterface variations, acting as phonetic

to read.&nbsp;<SPAN class=110315504-10062001><FONT

style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The 
major cause of today’s reading problems began taking root nearly a thousand 
years ago as the Latin alphabet and the English language collided. The Latin 
alphabet was nearly phonetic; it had one letter for each sound spoken in the 
Latin language. But in trying to represent the English, the Latin alphabet came 
up short by over a dozen letters.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
</SPAN>There were simply more sounds spoken in English then there were letters 
to represent them in the Latin alphabet. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">With 
religion, politics and academia so entrenched in the written Latin any thought 
of changing it was virtually inconceivable.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Consequently, instead of adding letters 
to the alphabet, a series of rules developed whereby some letters, (but not all) 
would no longer have just one sound but could have other sounds depending on 
which of the other letters (in what sequence) they preceded or followed (most 
but not all of the time). Sound pretty convoluted? The consequence of this 
‘hack’ has haunted us ever since: the phonetic principle was broken and the 
relationship between written letters and spoken sounds became complex and 
confusing.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

happened significantly altered the course of human history and its effects are 
still felt today by over 700 million people. The result of making up for the 
shortage of letters was an ambiguous alphabetic ‘code’ that strained the process 
of learning to read - a process that had for over fourteen hundred years been 
based on the phonetic simplicity of one letter for one sound. No longer as 
quickly self-evident, reading now involved the need to determine which of a 
letter’s possible sounds it was supposed to actually sound like in the 
particular word in which it was appearing. The stress involved in such decoding 
has remained deep in the ‘overhead’ of our reading process ever 
since.</SPAN></I></B><SPAN

matters worse further complications followed as the words, spellings and accents 
of Greek Philosophers, French clerks, Danish typesetters and others were added 
to the system.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Now, in addition to 
idiomatic codes for missing letters, spellings became incoherent as the various 
spelling conventions of non-English influences were imposed on the language. 
With the combination of Luther’s reformation, Guttenberg’s printing press and 
the King James translation of the Bible, the cement began to harden.<SPAN

aren’t many parallels to this. Under what other circumstances do people spend 
years trying to learn something that continually makes them feel bad about 
themselves as they do? Most children and adults have very limited patience for 
repeatedly trying to do something that results in self-esteem-lowering 
feelings.&nbsp;Yet, we must compel people to learn to read. They can't function 
in our modern world if they can't. However, the way things stand the technology 
is causing real and significant damage to people's lives (and costing us 
billions of dollars). <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Up to 
this point, absent a new alphabet or a way of spelling phonetically with the one 
we have, our only course of action was to facilitate the development of explicit 
skills and attention span increases such that developing readers might be better 
able to process the ambiguities we can't spare them from experiencing. This has 
been the role of explicit phonemic awareness exercises and explicit, systematic 
phonics both of which are attempts to compensate for, not directly address, the 
ambiguity created by the archaic alphabet and spelling 
system.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">But what 
if we could, without changing the alphabet or the way English is spelled, 
present our letters (on paper or screen) with cues embedded or accompanying them 
that could significantly reduce the letter-sound ambiguity involved in 
reading?<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This 
kind of thinking was impossible until very recently, until computers and modern 
font technology. Though the moveable type of the printing press was a 
breakthrough innovation in its day, it restricted us to thinking about printing 
through a paradigm that was based on what was and was not possible in a 
mechanism that used real physical objects to print letters with. Whereas 
moveable type made it relatively easy to set up any number of alternative 
typefaces, once within a typeface it was impractical to offer letterfaces or 
optional variations on the way each letter might appear.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">However, 
today, with modern font technology, it is possible and relatively easy to add 
another dimension to the idea of a character or letter. Specifically, it is 
possible to print (paper or screen) letters with shape, size, intensity and 
spacing variations, that while retaining unambiguous letter recognition 
features, allows the presentation of the letter to convey additional information 
or cues about how it sounds in the particular word in which it is encountered.

to learn to read without such cues.<BR><BR>There are more cues possible, this is 
a starting set.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>For example 
extending the width of a letter could cue the reader to the relative duration of 
its sound. Rotation or vertical centering could be substituted for spacing as an 
indicator of blend and spacing could be used for timing instead. The final 
visual variation styles for the cues should be the result of a collaborative 
effort which includes reading specialists, graphic artists, font designers and, 
of course, extensive learning and testing with developing readers.<SPAN

the technology involved is relatively straightforward. The first component is 
the "carrier" or shell that extends the font family to have the added capacity 
to store the alternate presentations for each character in a font. The second 
component is the "P-Cue presentation dictionary" which, like a spell checker in 
a standard word processor, scans the words in documents and looks them up in its 
database. When a word match is found, the P-Cue dictionary reads the character 
presentation variations (P-Cues) for the letters in the word and substitutes the

examples I have put forth are placeholders.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There is significant work ahead to map 
the territory of letter-sound ambiguities and to determine which metaphors and 
variations of letter presentation will best serve different types of developing 
readers. With that said, I believe it is possible to develop a system of 
variations that will cue developing readers in ways that reduce the 'overhead' 
involved in reading by many times the 'overhead' involved in processing the 
cues.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Based on my preliminary and 
informal experiments with children, I am confident that, once fully developed as 
an overall system, this approach will dramatically simplify and speed up the 
process of learning to read. <o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">What I 
am proposing bridges the phonic and whole language ideologies.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Instead of having to create ‘dumbed 
down’ reading materials or having to design reading materials around the awkward 
pedagogical requirements of cryptic decoding, the P-Cue model reduces the 
ambiguity involved in decoding and allows developing readers to access more 
meaningful materials faster (extending the ceiling on ‘decodable text’ to a more 
meaningful and enjoyable level). Finally, it does this without changing the 
alphabet or English spelling.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This is 
not meant as an alternative to learning other rules of decoding, as it won't 
eliminate all the ambiguities. Rather, what I am proposing will provide 
developing readers the means to quickly filter out a significant portion of what 
would otherwise be ambiguities leaving them with a less dissipated attention 
span to apply whatever rules remain appropriate (arguably new rules based on an 
integrated approach to using this technology with phonemic awareness and phonic 
instructional pedagogies).<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN 
style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I call 
this 'Training Wheels for Literacy" because this system is not intended to 
replace our colossal inventory of written materials, but rather to provide 
developing readers with an 'on- ramp' and the ‘training wheels’ that enable them 
to develop better phonemic awareness, phonic skills and greater attention span 
by making it easier for them to keep themselves from 'falling' out of 
reading.&nbsp; By enabling them to extend their reading flow, they will learn to 
associate the P-Cues with the phonemic distinctions available in written word 
structures and ultimately take the 'wheels off' -&nbsp;stretching into the next 
step of becoming an empowered reader.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

summary, this learning to read barrier; it's pain, shame and life-disabling 
consequences...our arguments about methodologies and the money we spend on 
efforts intended to compensate for it, stem not from some <I>deficit</I> or lack 
of natural capacities in our brains, but rather, from the change resistant 
technology of our 3000 year old alphabet and its poor interaction with the 
(nearly as change resistant) 1000 year old technology of English spelling. For 
the sake of the children, in the spirit of plain good science, lets acknowledge 
the fact and do something about it.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

later. Taking up this challenge could create a breakthrough in literacy, reduce 
damage to self-esteem, reduce the waste of billions of dollars and, perhaps, 
beyond all of that, change the ecology and efficiency of the "inner interface"

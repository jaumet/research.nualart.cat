<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>At any time in hundreds of communities in democratic nations across the world, citizens are working with others to help <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>community problems&mdash;often at the local, neighbourhood level. They work with government agencies to reduce crime, improve the <span>visual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>appearance of blighted areas, or stop an <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that may adversely affect the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> This <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>timely access to relevant information (<a href="#dur84a">Durrance 1984a</a>). While it is <span>axiomatic</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that information is <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>for the effective functioning of civic problem-solving and democratic functions more generally, information researchers know little about either the use of information to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>community problems or the role that information professionals might play in increasing access to that information. Scholars have theorized for decades that libraries and librarians can play a vital role in democracy (e.g., <a href="#dit47">Ditzion 1947</a>; <a href="#gar49">Garceau 1949</a>); and library professionals continue to struggle with how best to understand and carry out a civic mission (<a href="#dur84a">Durrance 1984a</a>, <a href="#dur84b">1984b</a>; <a href="#dur01">Durrance <em>et al.</em>2001</a>; <a href="#kra01">Kranich 2001</a>; <a href="#sch04">Schull 2004</a>). This research was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to inform our understanding of these issues. </p>

<p>Based on data collected in Hartford, Connecticut, in the United States, this study explores the use of information and the role of information professionals in a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> This is one of eight <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>field studies conducted as part of a grant from the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services that focused on the study of the information behaviour of people in <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>settings, emphasizing information needs, seeking, giving and use in the process of everyday living. The <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>research project, known as Information Behaviour in Everyday Contexts, was conducted between 2002 and 2005 by research teams at the University of Washington and the University of Michigan and  sought: 'to conduct research on how people need, seek, give and use information for everyday living' and 'to identify best practice examples of how organizations foster the use of information' (<a href="#fis05a">Fisher &amp; Durrance 2005</a>). </p>

<p>Hartford was selected for the study after a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>by the research team for a best-practice library whose staff had taken steps to anticipate the information needs of its <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> The team found that, in 2001, the Hartford library's director had received national recognition for 'building <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and family library service' (<a href="#ber01">Berry 2001</a>). And in 2002, the Hartford Public Library was recognized as an exemplary community-focused library by the U.S. Institute of Museum and Library Services, for 'developing <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>partners and innovative programs to address current educational, social, economic and environmental issues' (<a href="#hpl02">HPL receives... 2002</a>).</p>

<p>This study began with two objectives. First, the better to understand information needs, seeking and use in the context of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving and, secondly, to examine the nature of a best-practice, community-focused approach to library service. In the course of study we found that many of Hartford's <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving efforts are citizen driven and neighbourhood based. As we analysed our data we recognized that Taylor's (<a href="#tay91">1991</a>) information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>model provided a powerful <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to help understand how information was used in the context of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem <span>solving</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> The results of that analysis are explored in this paper. First, the model is used to help understand the information behaviour of selected Hartford organizations that seek to ameliorate <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problems. Secondly, we show how the public library has innovatively altered its practice to work within a specific problem-solving context (information use environment) to effectively anticipate and <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>information needs.</p>

<h2>Literature review </h2>

<p> Research focusing on everyday life information situations (cf. <a href="#der76">Dervin, <em>et al.</em> 1976</a>; <a href="#dur84a">Durrance 1984a;</a> <a href="#har94">Harris &amp; Dewdney 1994</a>; <a href="#sav95">Savolainen 1995</a>) as well as research focusing on the provision of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>information (<a href="#dur05">Durrance, <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>; <a href="#dur00">Durrance &amp; Pettigrew 2000</a>, <a href="#dur02">2002</a>) has laid the groundwork for understanding information use in communities and has informed our research. Pettigrew, <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#pet99b">1999</a>) examined a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of theoretical frameworks for studying the use of networked <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>information. Information behaviour research in the past several decades has incorporated and developed theoretical frameworks&mdash;first, as Kuhlthau (<a href="#kuh03">2003</a>) acknowledged, from borrowed theory and more recently in theories that have emerged within the field (<a href="#cas02">Case 2002</a>; <a href="#fis05b">Fisher, <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>). Recent research, particularly that <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>by the Information Seeking in Context conferences, has expanded the development of theoretical frameworks used and has consistently shown that context matters in studying information behaviour (<a href="#bis99">Bishop, <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>; <a href="#der92">Dervin 1992</a>; <a href="#fis04">Fisher, <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>; <a href="#kuh03">Kuhlthau 2003</a>; <a href="#pet99a">Pettigrew 1999</a>; <a href="#pet01">Pettigrew, <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>; <a href="#tal99">Talja, <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>; <a href="#tuo97">Tuominen &amp; Savolainen 1997</a>; <a href="#vak97">Vakkari, <em>et al.</em> 1997</a>). </p>

<p>We have written elsewhere of the specific influence of Dervin on our research (<a href="#pet02">Pettigrew, <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>; <a href="#pet99b">1999</a>). In this paper we use Taylor's (<a href="#tay91">1991</a>) seminal paper on information use environments because of its <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to and implications for the professional practice of librarians. Taylor developed the information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>model as a user- and context-centric construct for framing practice. Taylor recognized that his model was <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>by Dervin's sense-making theory (<a href="#der83">Dervin 1983</a>, <a href="#der89">1989</a>, <a href="#der76">1976</a>) and by Dervin and Nilan's (<a href="#der86">1986</a>) review that had identified the paradigm shift in information behaviour research from system-centered user studies to a <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>on understanding information needs, seeking and use. Taylor anticipated that the  information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>would serve as 'a bridge between (a) users and their environments, and (b) the world of the system designer, information manager, and those who really make the system work&mdash;from <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>librarians to information analysts' (<a href="#tay91">Taylor 1991</a>: 218). </p>

<p>Taylor's model foreshadowed much of the current contextually-focused research with 1) its <em>sets of people</em>&mdash;often those who share work or organizational settings&mdash;who share assumptions, preferences for various media and channels, social networks, and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>about certain phenomena; 2) its realization that <em>the problems</em> (and, importantly, their various dimensions) focused on by these sets of people  profoundly affect the <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of information they think will be useful; 3) its recognition that the constraints and opportunities provided by the <em>setting</em>&mdash;most commonly a work setting&mdash;influence information use; and 4) its understanding that <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to <em>problem resolution</em> influence information seeking and use. Thus, the essence of Taylor's model is its framing of conditions associated with information use. Many information behaviour researchers have incorporated these concepts into their research (e.g. <a href="#aga99">Agada 1999</a>; <a href="#cho06">Choo 2006</a>; <a href="#cho93">Choo &amp; Auster 1993</a>; <a href="#det00">Detlor 2000</a>; <a href="#kuh03">Kuhlthau 2003</a>, <a href="#kuh05">2005</a>). For example, Choo effectively incorporates Taylor's model (along with concepts from Dervin (<a href="#der83">1983</a>, <a href="#der92">1992</a>), Kuhlthau (<a href="#kuh03">2003</a>), and others into his integrated model of information-seeking behaviour, emphasizing that 'the outcome of information use is a change in the individual's capacity to act' (<a href="#cho06">Choo 2006</a>: 65).</p>

<p>The research presented in this paper uses the information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>as a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>while also leveraging the conceptual gains afforded by the contextual <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>used by researchers in recent years. Using this integrated <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>allows us to examine both the information needs of citizens engaged in <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving and the innovative community-focused model of engagement employed by a public library. Moreover, the work seeks to add to the richness of information behaviour research and to inform the practice of librarians, and in doing so, to help bridge the continuing gap between information behaviour research and information practice in libraries.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>Data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>took place in two rounds. The first round focused on the information behaviour of Hartford <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>groups who are trying to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problems in the city. It was apparent after this round that, not only was significant problem-solving activity <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>place, but that the library was participating in and supporting this activity in a unique way, practicing a kind of community-based group <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>activity. The second round of data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to understand the library's approach and analyse its components in order to provide a potential practice model for libraries. In order to understand <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and library <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in depth, several <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>were used, including <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>groups, telephone and face-to-face interviews, observation of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and library meetings, and analysis of supporting <span>documents</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The first round of data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to capture depictions of information behaviour relating to <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving from several points of view, using stakeholder analysis as a <span>sampling</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>framework</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> We identified groups that were engaged in <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving initially through leads provided by library staff; these groups were augmented through snowball <span>sampling</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>during data <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> To prepare for our site visit, we examined reports, <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and Websites and conducted preliminary telephone interviews with library staff members and staff from other information-providing organizations, which had been partnering with the library on a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>database project. This helped to provide an overview of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problems, the problem-solving landscape, and the <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>s use of information in problem-solving. On site interviews and observations were conducted with organizing groups that support and facilitate the work of neighbourhood-level groups; <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>nonprofit organizations that <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problems with a <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>on a particular issue; and neighbourhood-based, problem-solving committees and economic revitalization groups. We <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to understand the information needs, seeking and use of local nonprofit organizationa and neighbourhood-based groups by focusing on specific problem-solving goals, activities and resolutions as well as the role of information in that process. </p>

<p>The second round of data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>focused specifically on explicating the library's <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to interacting with the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and anticipating and responding to its needs. Telephone interviews were conducted with library staff members who had been identified as active in <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving through their role as neighbourhood team members. To understand how the neighbourhood team model might function in a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> these interviews focused on the practice of the staff in interacting with the neighbourhoods they serve, including their activities, philosophy, library support <span>mechanisms</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> barriers and successes. Between the two rounds, data from fifteen <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>groups and seventeen library staff members inform the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>described here.</p>

<p>Round one data were coded thematically using information behaviour concepts such as type of information needed, sources consulted, barriers encountered, information <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>towards information. The codebook also incorporated themes germane to problem-solving activity such as the nature of problems, their resolutions, <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to problem <span>solving</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> contextual aspects of the problem-solving <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and the role of information in problem-solving activities. Since round two <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to explicate a practice model, a grounded theory approach was taken to capture aspects of the library staff's practice from their <span>perspective</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> Eventually, themes evolved that described the library's philosophical approach to <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving, staff activities that anticipated and responded to <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>information needs, library infrastructure that <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>engagement and staff <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that facilitated active participation in the problem-solving process. In order to triangulate the data collected, supporting documentation (such as reports, articles and library communications) was also coded using this scheme.</p>


<h2>Findings: <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving as an information use environment</h2>

<p>In this section we examine the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>we identified in Hartford, Connecticut, the components of which include <em>the</em><em>people</em> who, through various <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations, are actively working to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><em>the problems</em> that Hartford neighbourhoods face. The neighbourhoods, within the <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>city, comprise <em>the setting</em>. Various <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations seek to <em>resolve neighbourhood problems </em>that are or can be <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>by information. </p>

<p>The <em>people</em> in our study are acting through organizations that work on behalf of others and who help citizens become more involved in the <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to the problems facing them. The study focused primarily on two types of neighbourhood organizations: problem-solving committees, and neighbourhood revitalization zone organizations. Both types of organization function within Hartford's seventeen officially designated neighbourhoods and are composed of neighbourhood citizens, <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>owners, nonprofit organization and <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>representatives, and other stakeholders. </p>

<p><em>The problems</em> besetting Hartford are numerous. As one report notes, 'the neighbourhoods are struggling with many issues, including <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of jobs, public safety issues, deteriorating housing, under-resourced <span>schools</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> and the return of formerly incarcerated individuals into their <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> (<a href="#ran04">Ranghelli, <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>). Groups such as the neighbourhood revitalization zone organizations and the problem-solving committees who meet monthly to address these problems tend to address <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>manifestations of the broader issues, such as graffiti, traffic calming measures, or after-school <span>programming</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> For each of these groups, the types of problems addressed and resolutions <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>have been defined in terms of the group's organizational purpose, original charter and funding sources as well as by the historical track record of what had worked. The problem-solving committees for example, emerged from 'block watch' programmes and tend to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>on <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of life issues such as public safety, neighbourhood appearance and noise. The neighbourhood revitalization zone organizations have been focused on issues like attracting viable businesses to the area and improving home ownership rates. Both groups attack problems such as nuisance businesses, blighted buildings, and the appearance of neighbourhood streets.</p>

<p>The information needs, seeking and use of these groups appears to be largely shaped by their commitment to <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>the problems that plague their neighbourhoods. The criticality of information was <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>described without identifying it as such&mdash;dealing with blighted properties, a frequent activity taken on by problem-solving committees, <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>the ability to identify the property owner in order to take <span>action</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> An important dimension of this information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>seems to be a preference to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <em>problem</em> rather than on information. The Hartford citizen groups we interviewed frame their process in terms of the activities and work-arounds necessary to complete an activity or reach a <span>resolution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>for the problem at hand rather than the information needed. </p>

<p>The citizen groups we talked with derived their information needs and their attendant use of information from their understanding of the problems at hand and, importantly, from the potential resolutions they perceived to be available to them. neighbourhood revitalization zone organizations and problem-solving committees typically described problem-solving situations with an explicit <span>resolution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in mind, which led to fairly specific information needs: factual, confirmational and <span>projective</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>data (<a href="#tay91">Taylor 1991</a>). For example, groups needed property record data in order to provide information for city officials on a bus tour of blighted properties, or they needed <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>information about their neighbourhoods to support grant proposal <span>writing</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> In situations where these citizen leaders felt they needed additional information, they tended to <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>a preference for receiving information from other people and through personal networks, something long known by researchers (e.g., <a href="#fai76">Faibisoff &amp; Ely 1976</a>; <a href="#har94">Harris &amp; Dewdney 1994</a>). Because many of the problems in Hartford overlap, the problem-solvers often know each other and are thus more likely to pick up the phone and call around to find a needed piece of information than to go down to the library and look it up. The reliance on networks is often seen as a desire for personalized or tailored information, a way to cope with information overload and winnow out irrelevancies (<a href="#tay91">Taylor 1991</a>). </p>

<p>We found that the regularly scheduled meetings of neighbourhood level organizations and organizing groups were places where information obtained or developed by one group is likely to be shared with others. Organizing groups that convene neighbourhood-level groups often see themselves as playing a significant role in helping to tailor and contextualize information. This may <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>both at the neighbourhood level and through community-wide meetings of neighbourhood revitalization zone organizations or problem-solving committees. One leader we interviewed reported reframing a neighbourhood revitalization zone problem by using information that was shared at an all-neighbourhood revitalization zones meeting about what worked for another group facing the same problem. </p>

<p>The <em>setting</em> for this community-based information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>is shaped by the activities of a loosely connected <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of citizen committees working in neighbourhoods <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>Hartford. These groups are well-established forces for change, having come into existence over a decade ago, built on federal programmes and a foundation of support from city government. Although they vary in strength and cohesion from neighbourhood to neighbourhood, they are widely recognized as venues through which change happens in the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> To this end, the neighbourhood level problem-solving groups often work in partnership with other <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>stakeholders, e.g., local nonprofit organizations and <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>on issues related to <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> merchant associations on economic revitalization, and local police on crime prevention and <span>reduction</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> These partnerships influence the nature of the information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and the <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>taken to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problems.</p>

<p>The <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that a group takes to problem <span>solving</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> the particular problem chosen, and the predisposition of the leadership will all influence the information needed and the uses to which it is put. Reducing blight or improving housing might <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>some factual knowledge about property ownership or local ordinances, or it may <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>a more <span>complicated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>understanding of how to approach a problem&mdash;what steps can be taken or legal <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>pursued. Creating a safer <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>may <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>access to crime statistics or an understanding of ways to keep <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>off the streets. Planning may <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>demographic or <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>facts about the neighbourhood. Being able to get the information needed to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problems in this <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>is sometimes a matter of knowing where to find it, sometimes a matter of being able to negotiate access to it, and sometimes a matter of adapting it to the purpose at hand. Once a group has successfully used a particular tactic, e.g., developing an information sheet describing a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>or highlighting eyesore or hazardous properties, that tactic is likely to be used again because it has <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to be successful. Thus, information such as property ownership and knowledge of city <span>codes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and legal options that helps to reduce a problem could be routinely <span>sought</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> located, and used as part of the process. </p>

<p>The information needs and uses within a given information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>are dictated by the nature of the problems people are trying to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and what they see as possible resolutions. Dimensions such as problem structure, complexity, <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>assumptions, and patterns for their <span>resolution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>all have an effect on the 'kinds of information deemed useful' (<a href="#tay91">Taylor 1991</a>: 226). Choo notes that Taylor, and thus the information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>model, recognizes that:</p> 

<blockquote>...the ways in which people view their problems and what they anticipate as <span>resolution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>constitute a built-in though unconscious means of controlling the amount of information used. Thus, people's <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and anticipations indirectly control the breadth and depth of their information search&mdash;including the time and effort to spend on searching, where to <span>search</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> how information encountered is to be filtered, and how much and what <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of information are required.

<h2>Findings: Hartford Public Library's recognition of the information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and its changed practice model </h2>

<p>At the outset of this paper we indicated that Hartford was chosen as a study site because of the reputation of the Hartford Public Library as being community-focused. While the library staff do not explicitly identify the problem-solving <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>as an information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>a such, they have adopted a practice model that is built on recognizing the information use <span>environment</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>s components, understanding how it operates, and making substantive <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to it through the library's distributed Neighbourhood Team model. </p>

<p>Nearly half of the library staff are part of one of the library's eleven neighbourhood teams, most of which are based in the library's nine branches. Each neighbourhood team seeks to become knowledgeable about one of the city's neighbourhoods &ndash; its problems, issues, organizations and people, in order to make sure that the library has a positive presence and is serving the interests and needs of the people. To anticipate and <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving needs, neighbourhood teams actively participate in more than 600 <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>group meetings a year and provide other assistance to civic groups and nonprofit organizations in their neighbourhoods, <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>becoming engaged with the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>where problem-solving takes place. By bringing their professional practice into the <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> neighbourhood team members are able to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by the unique <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>the more effectively to meet information needs.</p>

<p>From a standpoint of library practice, the fact that Hartford Public Library has chosen to meet <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>information needs within the context of the problem-solving <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>is non-trivial. In most libraries information provision takes place in the library at the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>desk. Hartford Public Library's neighbourhood team model, on the other hand, acknowledges that problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>takes place in the neighbourhood. Recognizing that 'people in Hartford meet,' neighbourhood team members attend at least one and sometimes up to half a dozen neighbourhood meetings each month because they recognize that problems are often tackled in these venues. These meetings include neighbourhood revitalization zone organizations, problem-solving committees, parent-teacher organizations, merchants' associations and neighbourhood-based nonprofit organizations.</p>

<p>Going to neighbourhood meetings allows the library's neighbourhood teams to participate actively in the problem-solving process. Describing the approach of a particular neighbourhood team leader, a manager told us that, 'the approach . . . is to be at the <span>table</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>' He went on to describe one of the neighbourhood team members:</p> 

<blockquote>[She <span>believes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that both she and the library] should be a participant at the <span>table</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> Not sitting in the back row, not standing by the door, but a participant. Even when there's nothing there for the library&mdash;so that you are perceived as, and in fact you are, a member of the group. She then looks for opportunities for the library to connect and make <span>contributions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> Rather than just hanging around and &lsquo;let me know if you need me' kind of thing. </blockquote>

<p>Being active members of the groups in which they participate allows neighbourhood teams to align themselves with the <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solvers. As described earlier, the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>concern of neighbourhood groups is the problem and its resolution; information is simply a contribution to the problem-solving activity, rather than an end in itself. Accordingly, HPL neighbourhood teams attend meetings acting not primarily as information intermediaries, but representing the library as a neighbourhood stakeholder&mdash;participating in the discussion, and sometimes <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>on group <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>such as secretary. The staff we interviewed described working shoulder-to-shoulder with <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>members, being in places that are important to people in the <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> or being where things are happening in the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> One librarian noted, 'I have a little phrase, we weave ourselves into the fabric of neighbourhood life'. </p>

<p>Neighbourhood team members <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>being out where problems are being addressed as critical to <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>a way for the library to make a difference: 'Wherever neighbours meet, that's where we should be. Because that is where you are going to find out about the needs and you're going to hear about it in a real <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>kind of way.' In an <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>where face-to-face communication and personal networks are preferred, library staff have situated themselves as part of those networks: present and ready to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to information needs as they <span>arise</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>This strategy of active participation takes the library staff to the locus of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>where it can innovatively anticipate and <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>information needs. By being in proximity to the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving, library staff are able to help illuminate information needs, whereas at the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>desk they are only able to act after the group perceives that it is appropriate to bring a question to the library (<a href="#tay68">Taylor 1968</a>). The neighbourhood teams appear to be providing access to information at a level beyond the physical, staying true to Taylor's conception of access as about 'the perceived validity and <span>utility</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of information, and perhaps, above all, with a sense that personal dialogue will help to clarify both need and <span>response</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> and hence to provide more useful information' (<a href="#tay91">Taylor 1991</a>: 228). The staff's presence at problem-solving meetings provides for the dialog that clarifies what is needed and provides an effective venue for the library's <span>response</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The impact of such information is seen in the story related by one of the librarians we interviewed. While attending a neighbourhood revitalization zone organization meeting at the library the librarian <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that the interpretation of statistics relevant to a problem was in <span>dispute</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> The librarian then went to his <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and pulled off the original data and facilitated the group's <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of the statistics and leading them to an understanding of where the miscommunication was occurring. Since the group had a set of numbers already, this need might never have made it to his desk at the library, but because he was in the problem-solving <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and functioning as a group member he was able to provide the necessary clarity to make the statistics useful.</p>

<p>Broader information needs have been uncovered and addressed through the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>participation of the library's neighbourhood team members in the problem-solving process. Occasionally library staff members have used their information-seeking skills to help a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>group reframe a problem such as in the following example, where a librarian moved a group from focusing on addressing noise issues to utilizing the Nuisance Abatement Act to take <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in their neighbourhood.</p> 

<blockquote>At the NRZ (neighbourhood revitalization zone) [meetings] we were attending the biggest issue was the noise at restaurants and clubs in a re0ential neighbourhood. So I was able to say, let's find out, because... [the club owners] kept saying it's not a criminal offense... So we looked at what the ordinances and <span>laws</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>were, what other communities had done. So that was the problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>approach, to be proactive.</blockquote>

<p>The neighbourhood team members who function within the information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>can assist in reframing problems because of their connection to other sources of information. For example, a librarian was able to redirect a group that thought they were ineligible for grant money because she participated in the meeting where the issue had been discussed.</p> 

<blockquote>'...and so the question came up that, &quot;Oh, I think that only applies to really big projects, like when they're going to implode ten buildings in Chicago&quot; and so I just did the research back here and said,&quot;No, they want some small projects&quot;. And there was one in Atlanta that had a similar number of households that just received funding.</blockquote>

<p>Library staff reported that they regularly provide information, including statistics, research reports, and best practice examples, as part of their role as participants in <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>meetings. With one foot in the world of the problem-solving groups and one foot in their information practice, library staff can effect a weak tie or a bridge to the best <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of other communities and groups, allowing for transfer of innovation (<a href="#gra73">Granovetter 1973</a>).</p>

<p>From a vantage point of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>engagement, the library teams working in a distributed manner return to meet with each other, both within and across teams, in order to share information about neighbourhood problems, resolutions, and resources. Being able to meet with colleagues doing similar work is an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>part of effective neighbourhood team functioning. As one librarian commented, active participation (and information provision) in the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>meeting is really only half of his full participation. The other half is sharing what he has learned with his colleagues. At meetings of neighbourhood team members he and others share what they have done and learned, 'mak[ing] that connection between knowing what's important... so we are carrying it on ourselves in our team <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>'</p>

<p>In many ways this community-centered practice of the neighbourhood teams is not unlike a variety of communities of practice that have been described in recent years (<a href="#dav02">Davenport &amp; Hall 2002</a>; <a href="#wen98">Wenger 1998</a>). Their reflective practice (<a href="#sch83">Sch&ouml;n 1983</a>) allows neighbourhood team members to adopt and reinforce the service philosophy focusing on engagement in the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> The library's institutional philosophy guides its staff toward <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>engagement. Interviewees provided evidence of being guided by organizational philosophies that steer their work, suggesting an organizational culture that informs and supports their work in the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<h2>Implications</h2>

<p>Applying the information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>construct to <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving environments shows how information use can be anticipated in even very distributed and seemingly varied environments. Community problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>can be found in many communities; the insights that this research provides can serve both to further the study of information behaviour in this context and provide a model for the practice of information professionals.</p>

<p>Hartford Public Library is engaged with the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>it serves through its consistent <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>with the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving information use <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> This distributed information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>would <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>be <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>purview of librarians. By reshaping its information practice within the <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information use <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> this library has been able to anticipate and <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>information needs as they are generated and where they are most relevant.</p>

<p>Through this research we have presented an analysis of a specific type of information use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and a practice model for working within it that we believe has <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>merit and applicability. Work in this area is critical because <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>problem-solving facilitates civic participation, creating an opportunity for information to effectively and routinely contribute to a thriving democracy.</p>

<p>In <span>conclusion</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> we emphasize that the <span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of information practice described here is not hypothetical. Hartford Public Library has adopted this set of innovative <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>for operating in the context of a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>information use <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> By explicating its <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and making linkages to their theoretical underpinnings we have described the 'Hartford Public Library model' in a form that enables its diffusion and adoption. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This paper summarises the principal findings of the work undertaken to 
investigate the impact on user attitudes and behaviour of the temporary closure 
of Sheffield Libraries and Information Services in 1995. Strike action by 
library staff following a breakdown in negotiations with Sheffield City Council 
over the Council's proposal to withdraw enhanced pay for Saturday working, 
resulted in an eight-week closure of 32 out of 34 library service points. 
<p>The service disruption provided an unprecedented opportunity to investigate 
aspects of user behaviour and attitudes not covered by previous research (<a 
href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/academic/I-M/is/publications/infres/paper18.html#asli95">Aslib, 
1995</a>; <a 
href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/academic/I-M/is/publications/infres/paper18.html#come93">Comedia,</a> 
1993). Previous studies demonstrated the value placed on the public library 
service but only by users and members of the public who had made their own 
choices about whether or not to use the service. The value of our research is 
that it provided the opportunity to investigate the behaviour and attitudes of 
users who are, quite unexpectedly, deprived of their library service long enough 
for it to have some impact on their lives. When libraries have been forced to 
close temporarily through some disaster such as a fire, published literature 
tends to focus on 'crisis management' rather than on the impact of the closure 
on users (<a 
href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/academic/I-M/is/publications/infres/paper18.html#simp94">Simpson, 
1994</a>; <a 
href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/academic/I-M/is/publications/infres/paper18.html#hold95">Holderness, 
1995</a>). Literature on the effect of service disruption due to strike action 
is equally lacking. <a 
href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/academic/I-M/is/publications/infres/paper18.html#myer91">Myers 
</a>(1991) reported on the impact of strike action on staff only, <a 
href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/academic/I-M/is/publications/infres/paper18.html#back84">Backhouse 
</a>(1984) only on the management of strike action. The temporary closure in 
Sheffield enabled researchers to examine the robustness of library use and the 
extent to which previous patterns of use can be resumed, to identify where the 
competition for library users' time lies and to make an assessment of the impact 
of closure on the local infrastructure. The overall objective was to help 
library professionals and policy makers to understand the impact service 
disruption or temporary closure might have on the future use of the service. 
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>The research used a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods. 
Semi-structured interviews to identify what distinctive changes took place in 
the behaviour and habits of library users during and because of the strike were 
conducted with 518 library users returning library material following the 
reopening of libraries. The five service points (Central Lending Library, 
Broomhill, Darnall, Southey and Waterthorpe) selected for participation in the 
survey captured a representative sample of the library user population in 
Sheffield in terms of covering a range of communities and libraries with 
different roles within Sheffield's tiering strategy. Interviews were also 
conducted with information service users who made enquiries at the Central 
Library by telephone, with staff at academic and public libraries in the region, 
and with staff from a sample of book shops in Sheffield. Data recording book 
issues was tracked to assess the effect of the library closure on issue trends 
and to test the robustness of findings from the user survey. Comments and 
complaints submitted to the Sheffield Libraries and Information Services were 
reviewed to seek additional evidence of user attitudes to the stoppage. Data 
recording the return of books still on loan at the time of service closure was 
monitored to provide additional evidence of the strike's impact on future use of 
the library service and to permit an approximate calculation of the cost of the 
strike in terms of non-returned stock. Local newspapers were scanned for 
articles on issues related to the closure to assess the extent to which coverage 
either affected or reflected public attitudes towards the closure. 
<h2>Characteristics Of Users And Their Use Of Libraries</h2>
<p>Core library opening hours are increasingly tending to correspond to office 
hours due to service reductions which place limits on library access for 
employed people. Findings from the user survey showed that 70% of the research 
sample were not in paid employment. In the case of one library (Southey) the 
figure was as high as 96%. 
<p>The user survey showed that 89% of community library users used the library 
for leisure purposes. It is ironic that a service that is so dependent, for its 
success, on leisure use should have its opening hours so heavily weighted 
towards 'office hours. The research raises questions about the extent to which 
employed people are effectively being 'disenfranchised' from public library use 
due to this weighting. 
<p>In two out of the four community libraries surveyed, more than half of the 
respondents visited the library at least once a week. For a third library, the 
figure was only slightly less (44%). Although 91% of respondents used their 
visit to borrow books, the frequency of visits cannot be attributed to the need 
to return them, since the loan period is three weeks. Although frequency of use 
was generally far higher than expected, there were significant differences 
between libraries which seemed to be dependent on the nature of the community. 
Evidence suggested that the library may be particularly significant as a 
community resource in communities where unemployment is high and access to other 
resources, including financial resources, limited. 
<h2>Changes In User Behaviour And Habits Resulting From Service Disruption </h2>
<p>The user survey asked if anything had taken the place of library activities 
during the closure. The findings provide an indication of what other pursuits 
replaced the library and where the competition for users' attention and time 
comes from. 47% of respondents did not find a replacement; 44% found other means 
of reading or replacing specific library services, and only 9% found a 
replacement in the form of a non-library oriented 'leisure' activity. 
<p>The research suggests that, although libraries compete with other forms of 
leisure pursuit for the attention of non-library users, for regular library 
users there is no significant competition strong enough to persuade them to stop 
using the service. 
<p>The picture is similar when we look at the 44% of respondents who attempted 
to find replacements for the service. There were many comments about the 
unsatisfactory nature of alternatives, from the high cost of buying books (only 
14% bought books from book shops or book clubs as an alternative) to the 
inconvenience of using other and less appropriate libraries. The 99.6% of 
respondents who said they would resume use of the service when it re-opened 
reinforces this conclusion. It is significant that nearly a third (31%) of all 
respondents said that they could find no suitable alternative at all for the 
missing service. The research indicated clearly that none of the alternatives to 
library use were satisfactory or acceptable on a long term basis. 
<p>Telephone users of reference services were more resourceful in finding 
replacement services than those who made enquiries in person, because it was 
easier to telephone alternative service points. It was easier to find 
replacements for business and technical related enquiries than for arts and 
social sciences, especially when enquiries were made by commercial 
organisations, as they tended to have more access to information services 
provided by professional institutions. 
<p>Three of the seven libraries surveyed in the region (Sheffield Hallam 
University, Manchester Commercial Library and Rotherham Central Library) 
provided anecdotal evidence of an increase in telephone reference enquiries made 
by Sheffield people. Sheffield Hallam University Library, situated within 10 
minutes walk from the Central Lending Library experienced an increase in members 
of the public using the business and reference services. However there was no 
indication that any increase in use of other libraries would be sustained 
following resumption of Sheffield's services. 
<h2>How Important Are Libraries To Library Users?</h2>
<p>The survey asked for which purposes users missed the library most. 79% said 
they had missed it for at least one purpose (78% missed the library for leisure 
purposes most, 58% for educational purposes). Fewer people than expected missed 
the library as an educational provider, possibly because the closure coincided 
with the end of the academic year. It was significant that educational purposes 
were missed most in those communities where people might have been expected to 
have less access to other sources of educational materials. 
<p>At Darnall, where only 1% of respondents had undertaken some form of higher 
education, it appeared that the Training and Education Council funded Open for 
Learning scheme operating there had contributed significantly to the high 
proportion of people using the library specifically for educational purposes. 
The evidence suggests that there may be a high potential for extended 
educational provision through the library service in communities with limited 
access to higher and further education. 
<p>The researchers had expected that most people would have missed the library 
for a specific reason related to lack of access to books. However, an 
unexpectedly high proportion of respondents said that they had missed the 
library for a reason related to its social value or because it had become an 
indispensable part of their lives. Well over half the respondents in three out 
of four of the community libraries surveyed said that they had missed the 
library for this reason. Clear evidence was provided of the very high value 
placed on the use of the library as a social resource, particularly in 
communities with a higher than average incidence of social and economic 
deprivation. 
<p>The contribution that the library can make to the quality of people's lives 
can also be judged from many of the responses to questions asking which specific 
library services users had missed the most, and whether they had succeeded in 
replacing them with an alternative during the strike. The research indicated 
that if people are deprived of a library, a high proportion will find reading 
material/information elsewhere or simply stop reading until the library reopens. 

<p>The research demonstrated the extent to which reading is an essential and 
critical factor in the lives of library users. For the majority (91%), it was 
not replaceable by any other activity. 
<h2>The Long-Term Impact Of The Strike On The Service</h2>
<p>A reassuring finding of the research is that only two of the 518 people 
surveyed said they would not be using the library again. The analysis of book 
issue trends since the strike appears to confirm that the extended closure has 
not broken the library 'habit' of users. 
<p>The research suggests that normal borrowing and use patterns have been 
resumed because library services are not replaceable. Libraries are too 
important in users' lives for them, willingly, to transfer to another activity. 
<p>Users surveyed after the strike commented that the closure had brought home 
to them how much they depended on the service. Indeed, more people commented 
that they would use the service more now the service was back, than indicated 
they would stop using it. 
<h2>How Important Are Libraries To The Local Infrastructure?</h2>
<p>Research on the economic impact of libraries has tended to concentrate on 
their impact on town centres (<a 
href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/academic/I-M/is/publications/infres/paper18.html#gree95">Greenhalgh 
&amp; Worpole, 1995</a>). However, our findings suggested that for many people 
library use is a key factor in determining the frequency of their visits to all 
local centres, urban and suburban. Nearly a quarter (23%) of all respondents 
visited their local centre less often because of the library closure, indicating 
that the library's presence in a local community may have a significant impact 
on local retailers and other businesses. The Independent Bookshop, situated 
within 150 metres of the Central Lending Library experienced a loss of business 
during the closure as a result of the loss of passing trade from people who 
visit the book shop en route to or from the library. 
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>Conclusions reached were that the temporary closure had not broken the 
robustness of public library use because library services are not replaceable 
for the majority of users. The research showed that for the majority of users 
the public library is a service of inestimable value, enhancing quality of life, 
and, for many people, fulfilling an essential need that no other pursuit or 
activity satisfies. It also raises questions about the sort of benefits that 
people get from the public library service and how this determines the frequency 
and pattern of their library use. Particular questions in urgent need of further 
research are: 
<ul>
  <li>What has the impact of library closures over the last 5-10 years been on 
  the lives of people and in particular on different groups in the community? 
  <li>To what extent have recent changes in opening hours affected the 
  characteristics of the people who use public libraries? 
  <li>What is the most effective range and pattern of opening hours which will 
  secure accessibility for the widest range of socio-economic groups? 
  <li>What determines the value placed on the public library service and the 
  frequency of its use? 
  <li>What factors make a local library service indispensable rather than highly 
  desirable? 
  <li>What is the potential for the enhancement of educational support for 
  independent learners from local libraries? </li></ul>

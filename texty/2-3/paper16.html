<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This paper reports preliminary results from the first phase of a study
investigating the use of computer networks and information needs of cattle
ranchers - a major group of information users in the rural environment
of North Texas. Computer networks allow ranchers to access remote information
sources and communicate through electronic mail and bulletin boards. The
aim of the study reported in this paper is to provide data on the current
use of computer networks by cattle ranchers -- the state of development
of the &quot;electronic&quot; or &quot;digital&quot; ranch -- and investigate
factors associated with network use by cattle ranchers.<br>
</p>

<p>Currently substantial national investment is funding the development
of an information society and the <a href="http://www.uark.edu/~niiac/">National
Information Infrastructure (NII)</a> to facilitate technology transfer,
increase research and development (R&amp;D) and improve U.S. industrial
competitiveness and productivity. The infrastructure requirements of agricultural
industries are an important area requiring further research (<a href="#egan92">Egan,
1992</a>). The development of effective computer networks and information
services, and policies governing their implementation and use, depends
on a good knowledge of users' needs and requirements. This knowledge includes
understanding the impact and outcome of networked information on industry
productivity. Little empirical data exists regarding the role computer
networks are beginning to play in ranching work, productivity and social
life. Few researchers have previously examined the information-seeking
patterns and information needs of ranching industry groups. <br>
</p>

<h2>Related studies</h2>

<p>A small, but growing body of empirical studies has investigated the
role of information in the resolution of human problems and the human process
of information-seeking. Previous studies have investigated the information-seeking
behavior of retired women (<a href="#chat92">Chatman, 1992</a>), battered
women (<a href="#harr88">Harris, 1988/1989</a>), students and library users
(<a href="#kuhl91">Kuhlthau, 1991</a>), health workers (<a href="#dee90">Dee,
1990</a>; <a href="#lund94">Lundeen, Tenopir &amp; Wermager, 1991</a>)
and university researchers (<a href="#elli93">Ellis, Cox &amp; Hall, 1993</a>).
Researchers have proposed models of human information-seeking processes
and the role of information in human problem solving (<a href="#derv86">Dervin
&amp; Nilan, 1986</a>; <a href="#krik83">Krikelas, 1983</a>; <a href="#kuhl91">Kuhlthau,
1991</a>). Many studies have examined the role of public libraries in the
provision of information services for rural communities (<a href="#dill91">Dillman;
1991</a>; <a href="#senk94">Senkevitch &amp; Wolfram, 1994</a>; <a href="#wilk91">Wilkinson,
1991</a>). Few studies have examined the information-seeking behavior and
information needs of rural workers. The study reported in this paper seeks
to redress this by undertaking an extensive research study investigating
human information behavior in rural environments, beginning with a study
of cattle ranchers.<br>
</p>

<p>A growing body of empirical research has also examined the characteristics,
use and effects of computer network use (<a href="#evel87">Eveland &amp;
Bikson, 1987</a>; <a href="#spro91">Sproull &amp; Keisler, 1991</a>) and
the role of computer networks in rural communities (<a href="#egan92">Egan,
1992</a>; <a href="#huds90">Hudson &amp; Parker, 1990</a>; <a href="#usota91">U.S.
Congress. OTA, 1991</a>). In a recent study <a href="#bish94">Bishop</a>
(1994) found that computer networks are used widely by aerospace engineers,
and contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of their work tasks.
<a href="#dela86">Delany and Chamala</a> (1986) found little use of electronic
media by Australian farmers and graziers. However, little is known about
the use of computer networks by the United States ranching industry.<br>
</p>

<h3>Cattle Ranchers</h3>

<p>Cattle ranching is as a complex information and communication activity
requiring ranchers to access diverse sources of information to support
ranching tasks, including purchasing, sales, financial, veterinary, medical,
commodities market, weather, cattle breeding, industry and community activities.
The proliferation of personal computers, the growth of the Internet, and
accompanying development of information and communication services, has
given cattle ranchers potential access to many new services. We need to
explore the types of computer technology and networks cattle ranchers access
and for what reasons, e.g., ranching tasks or to reduce the barriers of
rural isolation. Also, the types of information and communication services
cattle ranchers need, including information-seeking patterns and network
use by cattle ranchers following seasonal patterns with the changing tasks
associated with cattle breeding, feeding and slaughter<br>
</p>

<p>The UNT - Center for Texas Studies is also conducting a five-year project
&quot;Ranching in Texas in the Twenty-First Century&quot; to address common
concerns of the ranching industry (<a href="#cts95">Texas Studies Association
Newsletter, 1995</a>) including the preservation of the ranching way of
life, developing a closer ranching coalition, government regulations, food
safety, the environment and international trade relations. The project
discussed in this paper provides a significant contribution to the Ranching
in Texas initiative, as the issues of concern to the ranching industry
involve the distribution of information (governmental, commercial or industry)
and the need for increased communication within the ranching industry.
The use of computer networks and services including information databases,
E-mail, electronic bulletin boards and other appropriate services, could
contribute to preserving the ranching way of life and the creation an integrated
coalition of ranchers through the development of an electronic ranching
community. The extent to which this electronic ranching community currently
exists is explored in this study. <br>
</p>

<p>The results of the study also contribute directly to goals of the Red
Angus Association's Strategic Mission 2000 to improve the provision of
information and education to their members. The study provides pointers
to new types of information services, networks or network features, and
digital libraries for cattle ranchers. Understanding the relationships
between ranchers' information-seeking behavior, network use, work and communication
tasks will allow the impact of information services and electronic networks
on the productivity of cattle ranchers to be assessed. The results also
provide valuable data on the information requirements of cattle ranchers
and suggest possible information-seeking patterns and network use by other
types of ranchers and related agricultural groups, e.g., farmers.<br>
</p>

<p>The results are useful for librarians, including the Texas State Library
and local public libraries, who are responsible for the provision of network-based
and long distance information services to rural communities. Information
science researchers will also be provided with valuable data to develop
and enhance theoretical models of information seeking and use, network
usage, and adoption of technological innovations.<br>
</p>

<h2>Research questions</h2>

<p>The study reported in this paper was guided by the following research
questions:<br>
</p>

<ol>
<li>What types of information do ranchers need to support their work tasks?</li>
<li>What are the patterns of information-seeking exhibited by cattle ranchers?</li>
<li>What types of computer technology and networks are currently used by cattle ranchers? </li>
<li>What tasks and communication activities do cattle ranchers use computer networks to support? </li>
<li>What are the impacts of network use on cattle ranchers' work tasks and communications? </li>
<li>What is the current stage of development of the electronic ranching community? </li>
<li>What are the characteristics of cattle ranchers who are &quot;early adopters&quot; of networked information?</li>
</ol>

<h2>Research design</h2>

<h3>Data collection</h3>

<p>A survey instrument (Appendix A) was designed and pretested during summer
1995, with the Executive Secretary of the Red Angus Association of America,
Dr. Dick Gilbert and his staff, using examples of previous surveys of network
usage (<a href="#bish94">Bishop, 1994</a>) and information needs (<a href="#dee90">Dee,
1990</a>; <a href="#lund91">Lundeen, Tenopir &amp; Wermager,
1991</a>). The Red Angus Association of America is a national association
of sixteen hundred Red Angus cattle breeders from 47 U.S. states and two
Canadian provinces, with its headquarters in Denton, Texas. The association
is dedicated to promoting and improving the breeding, feeding and marketing
of Red Angus cattle (<a href="#raaa95">American Red Angus, 1995</a>) and
maintains a computerized registry of Red Angus breeding information. <br>
</p>

<p>The survey instrument with a cover letter from the Executive Director
of the Red Angus was mailed to the 1600 members of the Red Angus Association
of America with their monthly publication <i>American Red Angus</i>. A
follow up notice was also sent in the next issue of the American Red Angus.
This survey solicited information regarding members' information needs
and network use, and the types of information services needed by members.
The joint survey development generated data useful to both the researchers
and Red Angus Association of America regarding their membership. <br>
</p>

<p>Additional data collection through site visits to cattle ranchers are
currently being planned, to interview cattle ranchers regarding their use
of computer networks, and information seeking patterns and needs. Interview
volunteers were solicited during the survey. The interviews will also be
used to establish sites for the collection of longitudinal data through
an interview schedule over a twelve month period. A longitudinal study
will provide data to assess the seasonal nature of network use, and information
seeking and use by cattle ranchers.<br>
</p>

<h2>Preliminary results</h2>

<p>A total of 209 (approximately10%) of Red Angus members responded to
the survey. Initial data analysis indicates most respondents own and used
a personal computer. Some 188 (90%) of respondents said they owned a computer,
including 51 (24%) with a CD-ROM drive and 52 (24%) with a modem. Some
53 (25%) of respondents owned a satellite dish. Most respondents -- 175
(83%) said they did not use computer network services on their ranch. Of
the 21 who did use computer network services, they had used computer networks
for an average of 25 months and used them for an average of 5% of their
average work week. A higher proportion -- 87 (41%) of respondents said
members of their family used computer networks outside the home, mainly
for school or work located away from the ranch.<br>
<br>
</p>

<p>The initial data analysis shows that respondents to the survey were
ranchers using personal computers, including a small minority accessing
computer networks. <br>
</p>

<h3>Computer network services used by cattle ranchers</h3>

<p>Table 1 and table 2 provides the responses by Red Angus members regarding
their use and the value of existing networked information services. The
vast majority of respondents had not used networked information services
- within a range of 1% to 11%. The largest group (about 11%) was using
the Red Angus Sire Finder and Bulletin Board, the Internet or America Online.
There was very little usage and value placed on agricultural networked
information services. <br>

<h3>Information Sources Used By Cattle Ranchers<br>
</h3>

<p>Table 4 shows that word-of-mouth sources, such as customers, suppliers
and other ranchers, and also industry magazines and ranching associations
were major sources of information for cattle ranchers. Very few ranchers
were accessing these sources of information electronically. Less used were
libraries, political groups and bulletin boards. Overall, about a quarter
of respondents showed an interest in using networks for electronic mail
or information services.<br>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>These preliminary results were based on a smaller group of respondents,
but indicate some interesting findings. At this stage of development the
&quot;electronic&quot; or &quot;digital&quot; ranch is only a gleam in
the eye of the ranching industry. Most cattle ranchers do not own a personal
computer or access networked information services. This may be due to many
factors, including the advancing average age of ranchers, not familiar
with computers, the predominance of telephone communication or the lack
of suitable services for ranchers on the net. <br>
</p>

<p>However, there is a small group of technologically innovative ranchers
or &quot;early adopters&quot; (<a href="#roge83">Rogers, 1983</a>) beginning
to explore the vast and ever growing electronic information world for services
suitable and applicable for a ranching business. Those ranchers venturing
onto the net are seeking information particular to their particular business,
such as breeding and ranching information. Most ranchers do not communicate
with each other or the outside world via electronic mail from the ranch,
although some family members are accessing the net from non-ranch locations,
as they work and seek education off the ranch.<br>
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>A major aim of this initial survey was to collect basic data to form
the basis for a larger study. The survey also begins to identify those
&quot;early adopter&quot; ranchers taking up the reins of technological
innovation for further study. Due to the changing nature of the American
economy and business the evolution of the &quot;electronic&quot; or &quot;digital&quot;
ranching community seems inevitable. How this will occur and the nature
of the evolving &quot;electronic&quot; ranching community will be fascinating
to observe.<br>
</p>

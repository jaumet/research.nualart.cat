<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Communication between library and information studies researchers in the East and Central Europe and the Western world is still in the embryonic stage, although practitioners in the field are participating more and more in various exchanges, organizing common events, and developing cooperative projects and programmes. But the increasing exchange, in general, has not affected the patterns of participation from various <span>regions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in the research conferences, which are the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>forums for exchange of ideas, though the European Union (EU) is supporting some common research projects such as <a href="http://www.calimera.org/" target="_blank">CALIMERA</a>.</p>

<p>However, since May 2004 there has been a significant increase in the number of articles from the new EU members (as well as Russia) in the West European research and professional journals. Previously, the analysis of bibliographic data usually revealed the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of scholarly communication between the <span>regions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(for the sake of simplicity, we shall label them East European or 'Eastern' vs. 'Western' or Anglo-American and Nordic). Previously, the increasing <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>was visible in the accession countries in the number of <span>translated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>books and articles, articles in <span>English</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> German or other <span>languages</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>by Western colleagues published in local journals, which were referenced by local authors relatively often, even before the process of accession to the European Union began. </p>

<p>The Western world scholarly journals in library and information studies also seem to be more interested in the output of the colleagues from the new EU members. If, in 2003, I could comment on almost every scholarly publication (about a dozen of them) found after a diligent <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in relevant databases, at the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of 2006 the number of publications was at least tenfold. Most of the articles <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in professional journals, but the number of research articles also was significantly greater. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span><span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <em>Web of Scienc</em>e (1986-2005) for articles by <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>Russian writers in library and information studies field or relevant cited items, yielded the articles from one of leading Russian information science journals <em>Naucho-tekhnicheskaja informatsiya</em> which was included in the database. This allowed me to get the citation data for the Russian authors. I also have found several Lithuanian authors cited in foreign publications (German, American, Russian, etc.).</p>

<p>The difference in the publishing and  research <span>traditions</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> as well as alien ideological <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of research and theoretical development seem to be additional barriers to the language, geographical, or economic <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>that impede the exchange. The increasing contacts are resulting in change, but it is slow.</p>

<p>The absence of researchers from the east and Central Europe participating in the Information Seeking In Context (ISIC) series of conferences, other than Aiki Tibar from Estonia (<a href="#tib00">Tibar 2000
</a>), suggested the idea of exploring published research output in the field of information seeking in Lithuania and Russia. I <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>the paper to the literature on information needs from 1965 (the year when, according to general agreement, the concept of information needs <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in Russia) to 2003. It includes <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>data on publications, analysis of contents, object of research, and prevalent concepts. There is also a <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>comparison with the development of the concepts of information needs in the West.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The terms <em>information needs</em> and <em>information users and use</em> are quite <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to the communities of library and information practitioners as well as to library and information studies  researchers in Russia and Lithuania. However, it is not clear if the objects of study, theoretical <span>approaches</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> and methods are comparable and how different or similar they are from those used in the Western tradition. My interest in this was raised by reviewing of the proceedings of ISIC. I was curious as to whether the studies related to the field of information behaviour in the West correspond with those carried out in the research space to which I <span>belong</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> My own area of interest in information users (especially their needs) related mainly to the studies of bibliographic services and information management (e.g., <a href="#jan99">Janonis &amp; Macevi&#269;i&#363;t&#279; 1999</a>). I have spent some time searching for published research and reviews, collecting the evidence <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>comparison</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> and studying the issue. I am sure I have not got to the bottom of the problem, but at least I have some data that allows me to speculate about some aspects of it.</p>

<p>If we look in general at East European research within the whole body of research in information-related behaviour carried out within the borders of the previous Soviet Union and socialist block countries we can <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>several broad areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>readership studies,</li> 
<li>information literacy (culture), and</li> 
<li>information needs.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Readerhip studies in Russia have a long-standing tradition and have been developed into an independent <span>discipline</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>by Rubakin (<a href="#rub895">1895</a>, <a href="#rub29">1929</a>). Since then, libraries (their research and methodology departments) as well as library and information studies <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and other higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>institutions have conducted research into various aspects of <span>reading</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>series of huge projects was conducted by the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>Russian libraries between 1960 and 1980 looking into various aspects of libraries, books and <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in large and medium-sized cities (<a href="#chi66">Chitatel'skiye interesy 1966</a>), small towns (<a href="#kni73">Kniga i chteniye 1973</a>), villages (<a href="#kni76">Kniga i chteniye 1978</a>), investigating <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of specialists (<a href="#spe71">Specialist 1971</a>), the Soviet <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>public (<a href="#sov68">Sovietskij chitatel' 1968</a>), not to <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of smaller research projects. The trend <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>after 1990: book and <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>as a sociological issue (<a href="#ste90">Stel'makh 1990</a>), in the time of cultural shift (<a href="#ste98">Stel'makh 1998</a>), at the end of 20th century (<a href="#but97">Butenko 1997</a>), <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in the life of teenagers (<a href="#via96"> Viatkina 1996</a>), <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#bir99">Biriukov 1999</a>), blind persons (<a href="#kov91"> Kovalenko 1991</a>), etc. Every national library in the Soviet republics also conducted similar research. Despite rather strict ideological limitations an impressive amount of quantitative and <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>data was collected. It revealed the <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>habits of various social groups, the influence of teachers and librarians on <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>skills, relations between <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and development of the imagination, various types of interests, knowledge, and skills, and placed the book in the context of other media. This research was, and is, important from the methodological point of view as it usually set the standards for <span>valid</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span><span>statistical</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> sociological, <span>psychological</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> and other research methods. One may guess that this research <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>might be closest to Western research on information users' behaviour from this point of view.</p>

<p>Another intensive and vast research activity in information literacy issues can be and usually is missed by Westerners. The <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>for information literacy in Russian and, subsequently, in the <span>languages</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of neighbouring countries is 'informatsionnaja kul'tura' or, literally, 'information culture'. This <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>springs from the <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>with literacy and <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>skills, but during fifty years and especially the latest decade, reflects on a wider <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of skills required for 'cultural development of an individual'.  However, the translation 'information culture' effectively loses these publications in <em>Library and Information Science Abstracts</em> (<em>LISA</em>), other than several that have been located correctly under 'information literacy'. Thus, the 'language barrier', <span>limits</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>access to a <span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>flow of  Eastern literature on user <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and related topics.</p>

<p>The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>research <span>direction</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> that of information needs, is the youngest and the first publications <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>approximately forty years ago. In 1965 <a href="#mik65">Mikhailov, <em>et al.</em></a> discussed the needs of scientists in relation to science information resources. That was almost a decade later than Bernal's <span>famous</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>conference paper (<a href="#ber59">1959</a>). Bliumenau states that the '<em>historical <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of research into information needs is characterised by ups and downs and among hundreds and hundreds of publications very few <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>this complex problem in depth...</em>' Bliumenau (<a href="#bli97">1997</a>: 38) </p>

<p>Actually, I have the impression that in talking about hundreds and hundreds of publications Bliumenau is exaggerating. In the catalogue of the abstracts of doctoral dissertations defended in Soviet Union and Russia from 1987 to 2002, 310 dissertations within the library and information science field are registered. Only six can be related to information needs or information behaviour. Another three were defended in 2003-2005. There were also approximately twenty works investigating library and information service, information provision and support to various groups of users. To some extent users' needs may also be discussed in these dissertations. Do these <span>figures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>point to 'hundreds of research articles'?</p> 

<h2>Method</h2>

<p>The basic <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of relevant publications was the abstracts journal <em>Informatika&mdash;59</em> published by <a href="http://www.viniti.ru/Welcome.html" target="_blank">VINITI</a> for publications in Russian, and the national bibliography of articles for Lithuanian papers. The database of <em>Informkul'tura</em> as well as <em>LISA</em> and <em>Library Literature &amp; Information Science</em> databases were used for control <span>purposes</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> Some <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>Russian and Lithuanian library and information studies journals (<em><a href="http://www.kcnti.ru/irr/" target="_blank">Informatsionnye resursy Rosii</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.viniti.ru/pro_magazine.html" target="_blank">Nauchno-tekhnicheskaya informatsiya</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.gpntb.ru/win/ntb/index.html" target="_blank">Nauchnye i tekhnicheskiye biblioteki</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.tzc.vu.lt/im" target="_blank">Informacijos mokslai</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.leidykla.vu.lt/inetleid/knygot/knygot.html" target="_blank">Knygotyra</a></em>) can be found as a full-text <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>resource on the Web. Usually, articles published from 1996 or 1997 can be retrieved from these sites. Some others (<em>Bibliotekovedenije</em>, <em>Mir bibliografii</em>) <span>publish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>only contents pages. These sources were also used to fill in the gaps. The <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>lists were studied to fill in the gaps for the earlier <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(before 1996) and to identify the most <span>influential</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>authors and publications. <em>Web of Science</em> was used to find <span>partial</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>citation data.</p>

<p>The abstracting journal <em>Informatika-59</em> registers the abstracts of Russian and foreign articles, books, dissertations, conference materials, etc. It has a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>section, 'Information users' needs and information users', which was the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>source of required information. </p>

<p>The publications were retrieved from Lithuanian and Russian libraries or the Internet (for the latest years). In cases when it was <span>impossible</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to get a full-text (e.g., some old conference material or small print-run publications) the abstracts were used to assess the relevance, content, and research <span>details</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>The content of publications was studied to find out the <span>definitions</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> structures, and models of information needs and to extract the data about research methods. The discussion part is devoted to the <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of the development of the concept 'information needs' in the Anglo-American and Russian-Lithuanian tradition.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<h3>Statistical aspects of publications on information needs</h3>

<p>Reviews of literature of existing research on information needs were done by several authors in different years (<a href="#vov96">Voverien&#279; 1996</a>, <a href="#kru90">Kr&#363;minait&#279; 1990</a>, <a href="#bli86">Bliumenau 1986</a>). From all of them one can see that the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>number of publications was not enormous. According to the estimates from 1965 to 2003, 308 items discussing information needs <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in Russia and sixty-eight in Lithuania. Since then, in the mainstream journals and publishing houses, eight more items were published in Russia and four in Lithuania. The <span>dynamics</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>definitely show <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>over the years.</p>

<p>The highest peaks of publishing are <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in 1990 and 1992. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>close look revealed that in 1990 a large <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of articles on research of information needs in fundamental science was published by the Novosibirsk department of the Academy of Science (<a href="#sob90">Soboleva &amp; Chistiakov 1990</a>). It included thirteen articles. In 1992 another <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>on information needs in pedagogic and public <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>was published in Moscow (<a href="#inf92">Informatsionnye potrebnosti 1992</a>). The other peaks are mainly related to conferences that included papers on information needs.</p>

<p>The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>body of publications consists of conference abstracts or papers (c. 35%). Dissertations and monographs are quite rare (eight <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in Lithuania during the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and about twenty-two in Russia). The <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>periodicals publishing articles on information needs are <em>Naucho-tekhnicheskaja informatsiya</em>. Series 1 and 2, <em>Nauchnye i tekhnicheskye biblioteki</em>, and <em>Knygotyra/Informacijos mokslai</em>.</p>

<p>Occasional collections of research papers published by the institutions of higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(Moscow State University of Culture und Arts, St. Petersburg University of Culture, etc.) also include a significant number of articles on information needs.</p> 

<p>According to the <em>Web of Science</em>, authors who published most on the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of information needs were Shekhurin (8 publications), Bernshtein (5), Voverien&#279; (4), Sokolov (4), Bliumenau (4), and Kogotkov (3). They were also most cited by others investigating this subject. Our own files include also other productive authors: Kancleris (7), Chiornyj (5), Atko&#269;i&#363;nien&#279; (4), Zinkevi&#269;ien&#279; (4), Janulevi&#269;ien&#279; (3), Kalinina (3), Golovanov (3), and Soboleva (3). </p>

<h3>Problems discussed in the publications on information needs</h3>

<p>The research on information needs, especially in Russia, <span>depends</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> on one hand, on the general concept of the human being (as a species) and, on the other hand, on the specific definition of an information user. Both <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>prevalent within Russian information science have been changing slightly over time and in the works of different authors, but their essence remains basically intact.</p>
 
<p>Under the prevailing concept, a human being is regarded as a complex psycho-physiological system <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and acting within complex social system. According to Artamonov:</p>

<blockquote>From the point of view of information science a human being is a complex information enterprise, processing incoming information and producing information for other human beings. <span>Development</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and even survival of this system is determined not only by the amount of incoming information for processing, but also by consumption of produced information. (<a href="#art98">Artamonov 1998</a>: 29)</blockquote>

<p>Different authors mention various <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>for processing information in this system, but they invariably turn to one or another physiological function of brain. Sliadneva <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to a human being as '<em>a highly effective, self-educating system, which is flexibly adapting to the changing <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>.. via the brain's homeostasis.</em>' (<a href="#sli99">Sliadneva 1999</a>: 33). Yanovsky sees memory as a basic <span>mechanism</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of control not only over the incoming and outcoming information but also over the behaviour of an individual (<a href="#yan00">Yanovskyi 2000</a>: 7).</p>

<p>An information user in Russian information science is not only an individual. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>collective (a group, an organization, a social class, etc.) or  the inhabitants of a certain territory (a 'territorial user') is also an information user. The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span><span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of any information user is a goal (task, function, etc.) of work or socially significant activity that has to be <span>reached</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(solved, performed, etc.) with the help of information (among other means) (<a href="#kan67">Kancleris 1967</a>, <a href="#che98">Chernen'kij 1998</a>). Therefore, these types of collective and territorial users can have information needs (see <a href="#leo99">Leonchikov 1999</a>). </p>

<p>According to Sokolov (<a href="#sok96">1996</a>), an information user (or a carrier of communication need, in his terms) may be a biological <span>entity</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> an individual human being, a group of people, or a society. The needs of an individual and of a social group or a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>will differ in content, but their types will be analogous.</p>

<h4>Definition of information need</h4>

<p>During the first decade of the research on information needs the authors were concerned with separation of readers' interests and needs for special information (or information needs). Over time various terms were used in different works without any significant difference in meaning (need for library and bibliographic resources, documentary needs, need for <span>reading</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> communication needs) but 'information need' was the most widespread.</p> 

<p>In 1967 information need was defined as 'an <span>expression</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of the deficit of <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>information by an individual (collective or territorial) user <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>a certain scientific or technical problem' (<a href="#kan67">Kancleris 1967</a>: 2). The narrowness of definition was evident and soon it was <span>reformulated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>as follows: 'Information need is a necessity to acquire information about (or from) the surrounding <span>environment</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> (<a href="#rak69">Rakipov 1969</a>: 3). Most authors treated information need as a <span>lack</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> deficit, gap, or difference between the knowledge required and knowledge possessed.</p>

<p>The definition of the information need was closely related to its nature and <span>origin</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> When and how information need emerges was a subject of many <span>discussions</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> During the 1960s the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>outcome of the <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>was sorting out the confusion between needs, interests, requests, and queries. Many authors were looking <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>into the process of formulation and <span>expression</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of information need, rather than into its occurrence. Shekhurin had a great influence on the later developments in the field of information needs. According to his theory, information need emerges under the influence of objective and subjective factors. The objective factors are the goals of the development of the society, tasks of various economic sectors, directions of development of science and technology, etc. These objective factors generate 'objective information needs' of society and social groups. On the other hand, the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>problems are <span>solved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>by people - scientists and specialists - who have to find the best  <span>solutions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> Their <span>psychological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span><span>features</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> knowledge, <span>values</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> etc. are the subjective factors generating subjective needs for information. Objective and subjective information needs form a dialectic unity and can be separated only conditionally (<a href="#she68">Shekhurin 1968</a>, <a href="#she70">1970</a>).</p>

<p>During later years the notion of objective information need was criticised by the representatives of the 'psychological <span>school</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>, especially by Bliumenau (<a href="#bli86">1986</a>), who stressed the role of individual <span>expression</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and subjective <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in the process of originating information needs. According to his concept, information need is subjective and based on an objective need for cognition resting on unconditional reflex for orientation. Information need is a subjective reaction of the individual that provides a <span>mental</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>image of dissonance between required and <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>knowledge (<a href="#bli97">Bliumenau 1997</a>).</p>

<p>Kogotkov (<a href="#kog79">1979</a>, <a href="#kog86">1986</a>) developed and expressed this concept in the model shown in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>2:</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p256fig2.gif" width="728" height="323" alt="figure_2" /></div>
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 2: Composition of information need (<a href="#kog86">Kogotkov 1986
</a>)</strong></div>

<p>According to the author, information need includes the feeling of lacking something and wishing to fill the gap. Be0es that, some picture of the needed information also has to be present. In 2003 he defined information need as 'a necessary relation of a subject to information reflected in his consciousness and psyche' (<a href="#kog03">Kogotkov 2003</a>: 48). The representatives of this <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>saw information need as a result of human activity, which is the starting point of satisfying the cognition needs and, therefore, activity is both a starting point and a way of satisfying information need (<a href="#shc83">Shcherbitskij 1983</a>: 47). All activity of living organizms and especially human activity always generate need for information about the changing <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and the conditions of the tasks performed. The character of the human activity defines the character of information needs (<a href="#mot01">Motul'skij 2001</a>).</p>

<p>Finally, Sokolov (<a href="#sok96">1996</a>, <a href="#sok02">2002</a>) has rejected the idea of information need and suggested that it is only a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>case of a communication need, which he defines as a functional <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of a subject to react to a dissonance between the current and the normal state of consciousness by seeking meanings in knowledge, emotions, and <span>interactions</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Information need was recognised as a complex <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>generated by <span>complicated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>environments and peoples' <span>minds</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> The structure of information need was one of the topics discussed in various forums.</p>

<p>The earliest structures of information needs were related to problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(Figure 3):</p>

<p>Other authors suggested a more <span>universal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>model (Figure 4), which was summarised by Kancleris. It included undefined needs, <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>needs, and needs that have to be satisfied. Undefined needs <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>at the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of the work and <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span><span>intuitive</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>or experience-based <span>approaches</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> In the course of work the needs are consolidated and can be expressed more precisely. The needs expressed in the forms of request are handed over to information services or libraries to get answers. The author in this case uses the notion of a collective information need experienced by a group of specialists</p>

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 4: Structure of information need (<a href="#kan77">Kancleris 1977</a>)</strong></div>

<p>This structure remains more or less stable till present. Recently, Maksimov and Zabegaeva (<a href="#mak01">2001</a>) have defined similar four levels of information needs: internal, concious, formalised, and adapted to the information <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>language.</p>
 
<p>Once again, among the most <span>influential</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>structures of information need we find one suggested by Shekhurin (<a href="#she68">1968</a>, <a href="#she70">1970</a>). In this structure (Figure 5) he tries to unify the needs of various levels and to explain the relations between these levels. </p>

<div align="center"><img src="p256fig5.gif" width="702" height="431" alt="figure_5" /></div>
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 5: Structure of general information need (<a href="#she70">
Shekhurin 1970</a>)</strong></div>

<p>According to the author, the General Information Need is a need of a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>or any social <span>entity</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> It is an <span>abstraction</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of all lower level needs (societal, group, and individual). It is not a <span>sum</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of these lower level needs but includes the basic core that sets information need apart from all other needs. Societal and Group needs are <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>by Individual Needs and are expressed through individual needs</p>

<p>Five years later Korshunov used the concept of a general information need  to develop his functions of bibliographic information that were related to the general information (or documentary) needs: to locate a document, to receive a message about the  existence of a document, and to evaluate a document (<a href="#kor75">Korshunov 1975</a>).</p>

<p>Kogotkov (<a href="#kog86">1986</a>) also tried to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>a hierarchical structure of information needs but on a different foundation. He suggested that information need emerges as a state of discomfort, psychic tension, dissatisfaction when the barrier <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>on the way of reaching a goal or <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>a problem. This state leads to understanding that the dissatisfaction is caused by <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge how to remove the barrier. Once <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>the need may be satisfied in different ways: through getting information from another <span>person</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>experiment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> or otherwise. If an individual decides to turn to recorded information a documentary need emerges. If a <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>document is not at hand, the bibliographic information (or metadata) is required, thus bibliographic need is <span>formed</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Despite being far from resolved, the problem of structuring information needs dissapeared from the literature by 1989.</p>

<h4>Typologies of information needs and professional information needs</h4>

<p>The types of information needs were and are still usually related to the types of users or types of information resources. Popilova (<a href="#pop67">1967</a>) and Vysotskij (<a href="#vys68">1968</a>) were the first to <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>two ways of grouping information needs: according to how the required information would be used (theoretical, technological, organizational, methodological, scientific); or according to the type of required information (about subjects, about facts, about theories). The other popular division of information needs rests on the chronological criteria: need for retrospective information and need for current information (sometimes need for prospective information is included).</p>

<p>The most popular typologies of information needs <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>the classifications of professions in the Soviet Union. Professional information needs are most often researched in Russia and Lithuania.  Researchers devoted most <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to the needs of specialists in <span>chemistry</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> geology, medicine, and agriculture. Information needs of construction specialists, economists, or humanists attracted much less interest, though doctoral studies were also devoted to the needs of musicians (<a href="#gra96">Gradobojeva 1996</a>) and lecturers in the humanities (<a href="#kas02">Kasjanova 2002</a>). </p>

<p>Voverien&#279; (<a href="#vov96">1996</a>) has determined the attributes of professional information needs: dynamic character, dependence on the <span>discipline</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and type of research, dependence on performed functions, distinction between 'objective need' and the body of inquiries reflecting that need. Voverien&#279; also used the earlier suggested typology by Vysotskij to explain the structure of professional information need, which according to her includes the following elements: need for bibliographic information, need for factual information, and need for conceptual information. All of them can differ according to the width and depth of interests and chronological requirements. These needs form a foundation for <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of needs of the users for information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and services.</p>

<p>Another popular <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of information needs takes into account the function performed by a user: governing level, leader, lecturer, student, <span>scientist</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> etc. The group that was and is most explored is the group of scientists and researchers (<a href="#sob90">Soboleva &amp; Chistiakov 1990</a>; <a href="#kug96">Kugel' <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>).</p>

<p>Sokolov (<a href="#sok02">2002</a>) uses the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>'communication needs' and suggests a different approach to their <span>classification</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> He distinguishes a need for biological information (needed for normal biological activity), a need for social information (serving spiritual need), and a need for professional information. In spite of the change in terms he deals mainly with information needs. Sokolov still retains the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> 'information need' in his <span>complicated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>typology but it is applied only to a 'group communication need' for professional information.</p> 

<p>Finally, for the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of professional practice the variety of information needs is <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in several ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>collective information needs are <span>distinguished</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>according to the users' groups and their subject content reflects the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span><span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of work and tasks in various organizations;</li>
<li>individual information needs are <span>distinguished</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>according to the level of <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> age, experience, value orientations, styles of cognition (etc.), and competence of information work of individuals;</li>
<li>the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of required information, the <span>utility</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and benefits derived from it, and time of occurrence of a need as well as the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of its existence are important for both collective and individual information needs;</li>
<li>different information organizations and services operate to satisfy different information neeeds and look for different <span>expressions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of those for orientation: e.g., public libraries take into account the demand as an indicator or information needs while information support organizations take into account <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>fields of activity in the organization they serve. (<a href="#bre04">Brezhneva &amp; Minkina 2004</a>: 105-116).</li>
</ol>

<h4>Notion of information behaviour in Russia</h4>

<p>From the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of the 1990s the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span><em>information behaviour</em> ('informatsionnoje povedenije') emerges in Russian LIS literature. From the start it is closely related with information literacy: Ivankin (<a href="#iva91">1991</a>) suggested models <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to assist in choosing the best strategy and tactics in information <span>interactions</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> Other researchers directed their <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to the information behaviour of scientists as representatives of the scientific elite. This concept was defined as actions and efforts that a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>makes to get and use new knowledge or transfer and disseminate it in the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#kug95">Kugel' <em>et al.</em> 1995</a>: 12). It is not only closely related to the level of information literacy of a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>but also to social differentiation on the basis of competent orientation in information space (<a href="#bre03">Brezhneva 2003</a>, <a href="#dre05">Dresher <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>questionnaire for scientists in St. Petersburg was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to provide  <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>data on the sources and channels of information, intensiveness of informal professional communication, ways of disseminating new information in the <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> and self-evaluation of personal awareness (<a href="#kug95">Kugel' <em>et al.</em> 1995</a>). Thus, the <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>was following a wider concept than usual information need research, though still did not <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>away from the basic understanding of scholarly communication defined in the 1960s (<a href="#mik65">Mikhailov <em>et al.</em> 1965</a>). Recently, Maksimov and Zabegaeva (<a href="#mak01">2001</a>) have also <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>'information behaviour' in the sense of information <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>behaviour of the user in <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>with an information retrieval system. They <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>that users <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>into four types according to the activity and capability of reflection that influences their <span>action</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> affective, <span>cognitive</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> situational and decision states. In turn, these states affect their intentions, actions, <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and evaluations. However, the authors try to <span>derive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>the data about this complex behaviour indirectly: from the logs of queries and statistics of the users of databases in ISIS RAS (The Institute of Scientific Information for <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>Sciences of the Russian Academy of Science).</p>

<h2>Discussion and conclusion</h2>

<p>Research into information needs in Russia and Lithuania closely follows the developments in the library and information science fields and rests on the common conceptual and theoretical foundations and <span>approaches</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> Mostly, information needs were <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in relation to the development of <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and services of information provision in the Soviet Union. Therefore, the greatest number of researchers was, and still is, engaged in the <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of professional information needs of various specialists, or different categories of managers and leaders in industry, science, higher <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> etc. There is also a trend to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>the needs of a 'territorial' (regional) user. Theoretical developments <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>the needs of this type of research and also certain ideological restrictions. The underpinning concept of a human being as an information processing system did not change much in information use research. The notion of the hierarchy of needs from individual (on the lowest level) to societal (on the highest hierarchical level) underpinned by the concepts of objectivity and subjectivity is retained up to the present <span>day</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> Professional information needs occupy the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>part in this hierarchy.</p>

<p>The Lithuanian studies on information needs not only <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>the patterns of similar research in Russia: two Lithuanian authors - Voverien&#279; and Kancleris - gained authority in the field and led the creation of new concepts and understanding of information needs.</p>

<p>Despite this general trend, determined by the applied <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of information needs research, the development of theoretical concepts did not stagnate, and a variety of <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of thought or directions, such as <span>psychological</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> based on the concept of activity, or communicational, have emerged and contributed to the overall understanding of the problem. </p>

<p>It is interesting to compare the development of the concept of information needs between two broad and deep <span>traditions</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> the Eastern and the Western.  How do these two <span>traditions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>relate to each other? The easiest way to explore this would be, of course, to check the citations of the Eastern authors in the works of the Western writers and vice versa. We have put a <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>effort to trace these <span>mutual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>citations and have found that these two <span>traditions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>were developing in virtual isolation. Several studies of information needs conducted in East European countries were reported in the <em>Annual Review of Information Science and Technology</em> in the 1970s. Several articles from a leading Russian journal <em>Naucho-tekhnicheskaja informatsiya</em> found their way into these reviews by Allen (<a href="#all69">1969</a>) and Lipetz (<a href="#lip70">1970</a>). One big Russian study (conducted in 1969-1970) even found its way into the <em>International <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>Science Journal</em> (<a href="#gol71">Goldberg 1971</a>). We have <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>detect</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>any other references to the East European research in the literature on information behaviour in the West. Even the most recent comprehensive research guide  (<a href="#fis05">Fisher <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>) including the strong but much smaller Scandinavian research tradition fails to <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>any East European name, except Vygotsky and Volosinov who never did any information behaviour research and <span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>as the authors of broad theoretical frameworks in the social sciences. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the Western research tradition in information behaviour and needs research was never cited by East Europeans until recently. Two reviews of ISIC conferences (<a href="#mac97">Macevi&#269;i&#363;t&#279; 1997</a>; <a href="#mac00">2000</a>) have <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>this tradition to Lithuanian researchers and one to Slovenian ones (<a href="#vil05">Vilar 2005</a>). There was also a paper by Gaslikova (<a href="#gas99">1999</a>) reviewing the ISIC 1998 papers in the light of the creation of computerised information <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> but it was published in <em>Information Research</em>, not in any Russian journal. Two articles in <em>Information Research</em> show that Estonian (<a href="#tib00">Tibar 2000</a>) and Polish (<a href="#nie03">Nied&#378;wiedzka 2003</a>) researchers are applying Western <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in their research. The first mention of Western authors <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>on information behaviour - Ingwersen, Belkin and some others - has <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in Russia quite recently(<a href="#mak01">Maksimov &amp; Zabegaeva 2001</a>).</p>

<p>Despite the invisible walls separating those two <span>traditions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>along the borders of the previous 'socialist camp', one can see either <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>development of some concepts and <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>or emergence of similar ideas during different periods of time. </p>

<p>First, it seems that the factors directing the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>or researchers to information needs were similar during the 1960s and 1970s in both <span>traditions</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> According to Menzel (<a href="#men66">1966</a>), <span style="font-style: italic;">'the end of 1963 seems to have been something of a take off point for <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>research on the information needs and uses of scientists and technologists'</span>. The research of this <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in the West is concentrated on information needs of this group in the course of their professional activities and in relation to provision of information services or <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>evaluation of information <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> One of the most important <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>for information needs research is scientists' communication. The same trend is common to the information needs research in Russia and surrounding countries. Moreover, Paisley  expresses the urgent need for <span style="font-style: italic;">'...theories for information-processing behaviour that will generate propositions concerning channel selection; amount of seeking; effects on productivity of information <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> quantity, currency and diversity...'</span> (<a href="#pai68">Paisley 1968</a>: 3). He proposes a conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of 'the <span>scientist</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>within <span>systems</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>, such as culture, political system, legal/economic system, membership group, <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>group, invisible college, a formal organization, a work team, and a formal information system. To some extent this <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>echoes the concept of a human being as information processing tool and the hierarchy of information needs by Shekhurin.</p>

<p>In the 1970s a discussion emerges in <em>Aslib Proceedings</em> on how to <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>information needs, wants, demands, use, and requirements (<a href="#lin74">Line 1974</a>; <a href="#rob75">Roberts 1975</a>). In fact, it follows the same pattern as the <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of 1960s and 1970s in Russia and has the same purpose: to <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>out the <span>terminological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>confusion.</p>

<p>The <span>origin</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of information needs also was in the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of Anglo-American researchers. The concept <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>here by Kogotkov's model is an interesting case as it can be compared to several models and theories in this tradition. First, a <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>can be <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>between Kogotkov's <span>origin</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of information need (<a href="#kog86">1986</a>) and Wilson's suggestion (<a href="#wil81">1981</a>) that 'information need' is a <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>order need, which is caused by desire to satisfy <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>needs. In pointing out the <span>origin</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of information need from the understanding of a gap between possessed information and <span>unknown</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>information, the representatives of 'psychological <span>school</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> use an approach similar to Belkin's 'anomalous states of knowledge' (<a href="#bel80">Belkin 1980</a>). Kogotkov's process of seeking information for satisfaction of the need follows similar steps and involves similar decisions as Taylor's pre-negotiation decisions by the inquirer (<a href="#tay68">Taylor 1968</a>). I would also note that though Kogotkov describes the state of information need in <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>terms, there is a definite similarity to Dervin's sense-making approach (<a href="#der83">Dervin 1983</a>; <a href="#der03">Dervin &amp; Foreman-Wernet 2003</a>). However, Sokolov's concept of communication need as a need for seeking meaning to eliminate the dissonance in <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>consciousness is the one closest to Dervin's ideas, at least on the surface. </p>

<p>The structure of information need as generalised by Kancleris is comparable to Taylor's levels of information need, though described in other words:</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p256fig6.gif" width="614" height="251" alt="figure_6" /></div>
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 6: Comparison of the structure of information need by Taylor (<a href="#tay68">1968</a>) and Kancleris (<a href="#kan77">1977</a>)</strong></div>

<p>There is a clear <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>between the two models following the logic of the library <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>service. There is also a certain resemblance between the early structure of information need based on the stages of problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>by Bernshtein (<a href="#ber67">1967</a>) and Wilson's uncertainty <span>resolution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>within the problem <span>resolution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span><span>chain</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#wil99">Wilson 1999</a>), though they are used in different ways and for different <span>purposes</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> The place of stress as an activating <span>mechanism</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>for information seeking in Wilson's model (<a href="#wil96">Wilson &amp; Walsh 1996</a>) is similar to psychic tension and dissatisfaction in Kogotkov's concept (<a href="#kog86">1986</a>) where they play a similar role.</p> 

<p>In 1983, Derr analysed information need as an objective <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>almost in the same sense as Shekhurin in 1968. He suggested that, <span style="font-style: italic;">'...an information need is a <span>condition</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in which certain information contributes to the achievement of a genuine or legitimate information purpose' and that, '...[i]t is an objective <span>condition</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>rather than a <span>psychological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>state'</span>. As a consequence, <span style="font-style: italic;">if the researchers are to determine the information needs of <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>users of information <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> they first must identify the latter's information purposes Intensive <span>psychological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>study of users is not required to identify information needs</span>. (<a href="#derr83">Derr 1983</a>: 276). </blockquote>

<p>The issue of objective and subjective information of the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of 1980s to some extent mirrors the same problem in a reversed order (<a href="#der86">Dervin &amp; Nilan 1986</a>: 13).</p>

<p>Some criteria for the definition of information needs were described by Lin and Garvey. They propose that needs differ according to the type of work the user is engaged which is almost <span>identical</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to the <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>according to the function that user performs in Russia. They also <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span style="font-style: italic;">'categorisation according to the substance-versus-channel dimension'</span> (<a href="#lin72">Lin &amp; Garvey 1972</a>: 10-11), which roughly coincides with that based on types of required information by Voverien&#279; (<a href="#vov96">1996</a>) and Vysockij (<a href="#vys68">1968</a>).</p>

<p>Most <span>probably</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> one can find more and closer <span>parallels</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>between two <span>traditions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of information needs research; however, Russian and East European researchers were not much concerned with information seeking <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>the working, professional, or research context.  Students and youth are the only exception. The <span>rest</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>were treated usually as 'territorial users' to be served by local or regional libraries and information services. One can also see a clear difference from the recent research in the West: the <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of everyday life information behaviour is non-existent. On the other hand, a huge body of <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>studies covers, to some extent, the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of everyday life information seeking.</p> 

<p>There are also no <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>studies in information use or seeking that would result in the development of new,  wider theories and change of the old concepts, though applied studies of various user groups (professional, regional, organizational, etc.) are carried out regularly.</p>

<p>The differences and similarities between the Anglo-American and Russian tradition of information needs research can be roughly mapped on a time scale. The time gap between different developments varies from four years to twenty-one years. Four out of six ideas mentioned in this article occurred earlier in Anglo-American literature and two first originated in Russia.</p> 

<p>It is quite clear that the same object of <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and the needs of professional practice as well as similarities in research process lead the researchers to the discussion of similar issues. Though it is most probable that, following their own tradition, they will find different answers and <span>solutions</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> some of them may have common dimensions and even coincide entirely. This <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>is well known to science. However, in each <span>discipline</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and area of research the similarities and differences are unique. I am sure that I have only scratched the surface in comparing the development of information needs research between two <span>bodies</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of research. </p>

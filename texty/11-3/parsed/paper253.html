<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Despite the long-standing interest in online or virtual communities in the western world, particularly in Australia, there is a paucity of successful virtual communities or models of 'best practice' for persons with long-term, severe physical disabilities. The purpose of this <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>study was to develop a theoretical <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or model for a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for this specific group of people</p>

<p>The key <span>findings</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> model and theory for this study parallelled and <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>general <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>elaborated by Beamish (<a href="#Beamish">1995</a>). They also upheld the five necessary multi-disciplinary <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that Whittaker <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#Whittaker">1997</a>: 137) found <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to a virtual <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Beamish (<a href="#Beamish">1995</a>) described <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>networks as sharing the following three <span>characteristics</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> also integral to the theoretical <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for Queenslanders with long-term physical disabilities in the present study:</p> 

<ul>
<li>a <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on local issues in addition to information services, <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>networks provide forums for discussion of local issues; for example, in this study, the participants focused on their shared 'interests,' that is, in disability rights;</li>
<li>access&mdash;the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is concerned to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and include all members of the community; for example, in this study, the participants accessed information on assistive technology;</li> 
<li>social change and <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>development&mdash;there is a belief that the system with its communication and information can strengthen and vitalise the community; for example, the participants were empowered to pursue aspects of capacity building as part of strengthening and vitalising their <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></li> 
</ul>

<p>The first generation of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>developers originated from the <span>industrial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>world, but subsequently were joined by numerous others from all sectors. Schuler (<a href="#Schuler">1996</a>), a founding member of the Seattle Community Network, is one of the <span>prime</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>movers in questioning what these developers are trying to accomplish with these <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> There are certain <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of answers that were <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>at the first 'Ties that Bind' community-networking conference in 1994, sponsored by <a href="http://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">
Apple Corporation</a> and the <a href="http://www.morino.org/" target="_blank">Morino Institute</a>. They include the following: rebuilding civil society, securing access to information to disadvantaged or disabled people, <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>economic development, improving access to health care and health care information, providing forums for minority and alternative voices, improving communication among civic groups and improving literacy (Morino <a href="#Morino">1994</a>). This earlier work, affecting all stakeholders, needs to be reviewed in the context of experience. Rheingold (<a href="#Rehingold">1994</a>) and Schuler (<a href="#Schuler">1996</a>) were the front runners in visioning and implementing online communities through the 1990s. Preece also has written extensively on usability and human <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(HCI), but not with a view to developing a specific online <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> However, in Preece (<a href="#Preece2000">2000</a>) she correlates the key themes of sociability and usability, creating the link between knowledge about human behaviour and appropriate social planning, policies and <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to carry virtual communities well into the new millenium. usability has been identified repeatedly as an important component of human-computer <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(Preece <a href="#Preece1993">1993</a>; Nielsen &amp; Mack <a href="#Nielsen">1994</a>; Preece <em>et al.</em> <a href="#Preece1994">1994</a>; Hackos &amp; Redish <a href="#Hackos">1998</a>; Shneiderman, <a href="#Shneiderman">1998</a>; Mayhew <a href="#Mayhew">1999</a>; Preece, <em>et al.</em> <a href="#Preece2001">2001</a>; Hirose <a href="#Hirose">2001</a> and Carroll <a href="#Carroll">2001</a>) and sociability with social <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> usability is primarily concerned with developing <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to support rapid learning, high skill retention and minimal <span>error</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>rates. Such <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>support high productivity, are consistent, controllable and predictable, making them pleasant and effective to use (Shneiderman <a href="#Shneiderman">1998</a>). The implications for online communities is that users are able to communicate with each other, find information and navigate the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>software with ease (Preece <a href="#Preece2000">2000</a>).</p>

<p>While the literature abounds with <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for virtual communities, they all include the idea that these virtual communities or electronic communities are social aggregations of a critical mass of people on the Internet. They engage in public <span>discussions</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>interactions</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> and information exchanges with <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>human feeling on matters of common interest to form webs of personal relationships. It is <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>noting that the types of <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>members have, the type of content they provide to the <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> the <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of benefits they <span>derive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>from the communities, and the types of exchanges communities have with other interest groups vary greatly from <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(Chang, <em>et al.</em> <a href="#Chang">1999</a>: 1). </p>

<p>The ability of virtual communities to provide emotional support for their participants is well documented. In fact, communities have been <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>expressly to provide such support for precisely defined groups of users, such as parents of <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with special needs (Mickelson 1997, cited in Burnett, <a href="#Burnett">2000</a>) and people with particular health problems (Preece 1999, cited in Burnett, <a href="#Burnett">2000</a>). Even in virtual communities that are not explicitly <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>as such support groups, the development of interpersonal relationships is common (Parks &amp; Floyd 1995, cited in Burnett <a href="#Burnett">2000</a>). Such relationships, even though they may be, in some cases, closely tied to the specific subject domains of the communities in which they <span>occur</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> can be both intimate and supportive (Rosson 1999, cited in Burnett <a href="#Burnett">2000</a>); Wellman &amp; Gulia 1999, cited in Burnett <a href="#Burnett">2000</a>). According to Burnett, little specific research has been conducted into the types of <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or whether they are linked with information exchange within virtual communities that may be used to provide such emotional support (Burnett, <a href="#Burnett">2000</a>). However, Preece asserts that emotional support and information sharing are likely to be closely linked in such situations (Preece, <a href="#Preece1993">1993</a>). </p>


<p>Preece has found the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>online <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> or virtual <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> difficult to define and prefers a working definition of an online <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that says it consists of four <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>components: people, purpose, policies and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(Preece <a href="#Preece2000">2000</a>: 10). She finds this working definition sufficiently general to apply to a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of different communities, avoiding defining 'community' only as an <span>entity</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>rather than a process. Communities develop and continuously evolve and it is only the <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>supporting them that is <span>designed</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>  not the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>itself. Preece's general or working definition also includes physical communities that have become networked (Schuler <a href="#Schuler">1996</a>; Lazar &amp; Preece <a href="#Lazar">1998</a>), communities <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by a single bulletin board, list-server or chat <span>software</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> However, it is the first three components of Preece's definition that relate to the complexities and unpredictability that comprise human behaviour and link back into Preece's notion of sociability. For Preece, (<a href="#Preece">2000</a>: 26), sociability is concerned with planning and developing social policies that are understandable and acceptable to members, to support the <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>s purpose. Understanding a <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>s needs is <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for developing communities with good sociability and usability and Preece has <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>these close dynamic relationships in a way that is very useful to a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>developer (Preece, <a href="#Preece">2000</a>: 27).</p>

<p>Preece's model of 'designing usability and supporting sociability' with 'lifelong learning as their <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>focus</span>' <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> is exemplified by Britain's Learning Cities and <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>a powerful model for Queensland, and Australian, virtual communities for people with long-term, severe physical disabilities to emulate.</p>

<h3>Online communities for the physically disabled: the state of the art</h3>

<p>While internationally there are a significant number of web sites dedicated to disability issues, the Queensland Centre of National Research on Disability and Rehabilitation Medicine (CONROD) 'Disability Lifestyles' project validates this study. The CONROD project <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>an online <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in 2004 for the provision and sharing of information about everyday life for people who were completing, or had recently completed, rehabilitation after a traumatic spinal injury. This '<a href="http://www.disabilitylifestyles.org.au/" target="_blank">Disability Lifestyle</a>' Web site was an online stepping-stone between rehabilitation services and full <span>adjustment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>back into the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> It also may be seen to meet the needs of the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the disability 'life cycle', whereas the theoretical model that emerged from this study represents the needs some thirty years into the disability 'life cycle'.</p>

<h2>Towards <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>a theory about virtual communities for disabled persons</h2>

<h3>Aims, goals of the research</h3>

<p>The research has focused on the needs of one group of participants in virtual communities; persons with long-term, severe physical disabilities; and <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to develop understandings of one such <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to inform how virtual communities for disabled persons might best be facilitated.</p>

<h3>Use of the grounded theory approach</h3>

<p>Grounded theory was employed for this study. This approach allowed for exploration of virtual communities as required by persons with physical disabilities engaged in a 'community of practice'. The substantive theory and conceptual model were developed using this approach and were grounded in the real world experiences of persons with disabilities as they described engaging with information and communication technologies. Grounding this study in real life engagement within the disability community:</p> 

<ul>
<li>broadens our understanding of how virtual communities are experienced;</li>
<li>enables the development of a baseline study for further research into virtual communities; and</li>
<li>provides facilitators with a conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that will inform <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Denzin and Lincoln (<a href="#Denzin">1994</a>) have conveniently <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the history of <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>research into five 'moments,' some of which <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>simultaneously. The formulation of the grounded theory method was in the second of these 'moments' and was <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and published by Glaser and Strauss in <a href="#Glaser">1967</a>. However, it was Strauss and Corbin in <a href="#Strauss">1990</a>, who presented a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>reformulation of the method, which was further developed and refined by them in 1998.  Glaser <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>refuted Strauss and Corbin's efforts and maintained that they <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to present the reasons for their changes to the method as originally described by Glaser and Strauss (Glaser, <a href="#Glaser1978">1978</a>, <a href="#Glaser1992">1992</a>; Glaser &amp; Strauss, <a href="#Glaser167">1967</a>; Strauss &amp; Corbin, <a href="#Strauss1990">1990</a>, <a href="#Glaser1998">1998</a>). There are similarities and differences between these two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to grounded theory research; however, the controversy seems to stem from their different uses of axial coding (Kendall, <a href="#Kendall">1999</a>: 746-748). The grounded theory method has evolved into three <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>variations including Glaserian; Strauss and Corbin's objectivist version; and constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, <a href="#Charmaz">2003</a>; Goulding, <a href="#Goulding">2002</a>).</p>

<p>Several con0erations were necessary before deciding to use a <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>research methodology for this  study. Strauss &amp; Corbin, (<a href="#Strauss">1990</a>) claimed that <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>methods were used to  understand better any <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>about which little was yet known. Additionally, such methods could be used to gain new perspectives on topics about which much was already known; or, to gain more in-depth information that would be difficult to convey quantitatively. Therefore, the Strauss and Corbin method was <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>as most appropriate to this study because while information about many aspects of virtual communities has been available during the past decade, there is no recorded understanding about the needs of particular communities such as persons with physical disabilities. </p>

<h3>The participants</h3>

<p>The twelve persons with disabilities ranged in age from twenty-four years to sixty years with a mean age of forty-four years. There were four females and eight males interviewed: nine persons re0ed in Brisbane, the capital of the state of Queensland, and the other threepersons were from a large town west of Brisbane, Capricornia and Far North Queensland. Eight people suffered from traumatic spinal injuries resulting in quadriplegia1, two persons were paraplegic2, while one <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>had had poliomyelitis and another had a muscle wasting <span>condition</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Two people were extremely severely affected physically and disabled as a result of their injuries. Six quadriplegic people were regarded as very affected, while the remaining four persons were not as severely affected. In fact, the greater the severity of the injury and consequent disability, the greater the potential dependence on technology of these people for their 'independence' and the resumption of their 'sense of control' over their lives. The diversity of educational attainment of the group interviewed was consistent with the wide ranging nature of most of their other distinguishing criteria. Two persons had <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>education, three  TAFE <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and seventertiary <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with six others who had completed higher degrees. The <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of disability onset was from the age of 13 to 51 and the average onset time of disability was twenty-seven and a half years ago. All participants were categorised as persons with long-term disabilities. Consequently, the participant group had primarily dealt with all the rehabilitation, personal care and basic lifestyle survival issues that would inevitably preoccupy <span>newly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>disabled people. </p>

<h3>The interviewer-researcher</h3>

<p>In this study we used 'identification' as a methodological principle and the study may be con0ered 'subjective'. The <span>principal</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>researcher and interviewer in this <span>investigation</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> reflects below on her experience of the interview:</p>

<blockquote>I am a Queenslander, a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with a severe, long-term physical disability. I had no need to disclose these facts about myself to the interviewees, as the majority of them know me. However, I argue that my identification is a strength rather than a weakness, as the interviewees identify with my efforts to determine how virtual communities are best facilitated for persons with disabilities and they recognise the relevance of my study. In some of my interviewing situations, I was aware of the enormous pain it brought to some of the interviewees to recall the trauma of their accident and then to recount the nature of their ongoing disability. I began the study knowing there could be difficult and sad aspects, but not realising the depth of it, and how it would sometimes affect me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Personal experience can increase sensitivity if used correctly' (Strauss &amp; Corbin, <a href="#Strauss">1998</a>: 48). I would like to believe that my personal experience of deep identification with my interviewees contributed to my sensitivity in the interview <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and later during the data analysis stage in that it sometimes assisted me 'to make sense out of the previously unexplainable data' (ibid.). Reinharz says: 'The value in identifying lies in the enhanced understanding one can develop and assistance one can give. The drawback is the pain that comes from identifying with people who are suffering. We may gradually turn away to protect our equilibrium and continue our work'. (Reinharz, <a href="#Reinharz">1992</a>: 234).</blockquote>

<p>The subjective researcher seeks to know the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>through the eyes of the interviewee. This use of the traditional 'object's' viewpoint is asserted by Chatman (<a href="#Chatman">1986</a>), Mellon (<a href="#Mellon">1990</a>), Fidel (<a href="#Fidel">1993</a>) and by Sutton (<a href="#Sutton">1993</a>).</p>

<h3>Data gathering and analysis: forming the grounded theory</h3>

<p>As with other grounded theory research the process of data gathering and analysis in this study were closely interwoven. As the interviewer conversed with interviewees, the analysis process began and <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the course of <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>interviews, and also the interviewees selected.</p>

<p>For this research, a single interview question was used, derived from working with interviewees during the pilot phase. 'What can you tell me about your experience with virtual communities and how you use ICT (information and communications technology) both personally and professionally?' Through the resultant conversations with interviewees, their experience was made known to the interviewer, Each interview took approximately one hour. More time was allocated if the interviewee was distressed. The number of persons interviewed <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>until 'theoretical saturation' of content occurred and no new content was emerging from the interviews. Each interview explored in detail the elements and any barriers behind the usage of information and communication technologies  and/or assistive technology.</p>

<p>Finally, the coding and the analysis were performed. The participants' <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>were analysed using the grounded theory <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>comparison methodology. The relationship of the analysis to the literature was also con0ered repeatedly, as part of the necessary iterative process. Personal responses and narratives of both the people with disabilities who use the technology and the allied health care professionals were analysed and interpreted for meaning. All transcripts were returned to participants for validation. These de-constructed meanings were then compared and contrasted with those in the current literature.</p>

<p>The <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>theme to emerge from these narratives was how the use of ICT towards an online <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by persons with long-term disabilities allowed them to regain a sense of control and independence in their lives. Other <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>themes emerged; being online tended to break down isolation and also had the potential to change the work paradigm, both vexing issues for people with disabilities. These outcomes are increasingly seen as offering ways to enhance people with disabilities' inclusion, participation and empowerment in our society.</p>

<p>According to the grounded theory research methodology (Strauss &amp; Corbin, <a href="#Strauss">1998</a>: 101) 'phenomena' are the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>ideas in the data <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>as concepts. <span>Concepts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are the building blocks of the theory. Categories are concepts that stand for phenomena. <span>Properties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of a category, the delineation of which defines and gives it meaning. For example, for the category 'transaction' described later, the properties were 'e-commerce' and 'employment' (see <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>1 below). Dimensions are the ranges along which general properties of a category vary, giving specification to a category and <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to the theory. For example, some of the dimensions of the category 'transaction' were 'investments', 'shopping', 'ordering', and 'bill paying' (see <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>1 below). And sub-categories are the concepts that pertain to a category, giving it further clarification and specification: in this case, they are 'tele-working' and 'tele-marketing'. The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>objective of grounded theory was the discovery of theoretically comprehensive <span>explanations</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>about particular <span>phenomenon</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> The techniques and analytical procedures such as described above, allow the development of a substantive theory that is significant, theory-observation compatible, able to be generalised from, reproducible and <span>rigorous</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Grounded theory methodology is both <span>deductive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and inductive. Inductively, theory emerged from the interviews and generated data. This theory can than be empirically tested to develop forecasts or <span>predictions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>from the general principles.</p>

<p>Strauss and Corbin acknowledge that developing theory is a complex activity. They say that 'we use the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>'theorising' to denote this activity because developing theory is a process and often is a long one' (Strauss &amp; Corbin, <a href="#Strauss">1998</a>: 21-22). According to them, theorising is work that entails not only conceiving or intuiting ideas [concepts] but also formulating them into a logical, systematic, and <span>explanatory</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>scheme. They argue that at the heart of theorising lies the interplay of making inductions [deriving concepts, their properties, and dimensions from data] and deductions. Deductions are the hypothesising about the relationships between concepts, the relationships also are derived from data, but data that have been abstracted by the analyst from the raw data.</p>

<h2>Results: a model of virtual communities for persons with disabilities</h2>

<div align="center"><img src="p253fig1.jpg" width="662" height="751" alt="figure1" /></div>

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 1: The six types of E-Communities that constitute a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or the cornerstones for a Virtual Community model for persons with long-term physical disabilities. (Note that Access and Barriers relate to all situations - not just those depicted left and right of the diagram.)</strong></div>

<p>The model for a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for persons with long-term, severe physical disabilities that emerged was a meld of six types of electronic communities (see <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>1). The types of e-communities or sets of well-developed discreet categories (e.g., themes and concepts) that the data from this study revealed were the following, depending on the types of consumer needs they met:</p>

<ul>
<li>education; </li>
<li>fantasy-oriented; </li>
<li>information-oriented;</li>
<li>interest-oriented; </li>
<li>relationship-oriented; and </li>
<li>transaction-oriented. </li>
</ul>

<p>The e-communities or categories are systematically interrelated through <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of relationship to form the theoretical <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that explains the relevant social <span>phenomenon</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> although they are presented here as <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>units for the sake of graphical <span>representation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of relationship between these categories allows for objectification and explains who (relationship), what (information), when (interest), where (transaction), why (education and empowerment), how (fantasy), and with what <span>consequences</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(access and barriers) an event <span>occurs</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> For the model to be truly generalisable and transformational, all six types of virtual communities needed to be <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>as potential portals to be developed for persons with disabilities. It is also possible that the model for a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for persons with long-term severe physical disabilities, in fact, meets several, if not all, of the above needs, <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or orientations simultaneously. In the end, it must be emphasised that if any one of these types of e-communities were ignored, then the full virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>experience will not be available to persons with disabilities.</p>

<h3>A sense-of-control: the foundation stone of the model</h3>

<p>The need to gain a sense of control appears as a <span>foundational</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>element of disabled persons' interest in and commitment to virtual communities. The <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>theme or idea that emerged slowly, but <span>strongly</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> from the open coding <span>analytic</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>process that all eighteen in-depth interviews were subjected to, was that persons with long-term physical disabilities desired to regain 'a sense of control' over their lives. Increasingly, they found that this 'sense of control' was <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by their use of information and communication technologies and the professionals were as unanimous in their enthusiasm for the technology for their clientele as were the persons with disabilities. Access afforded 'a sense of control' and the barriers that are con0ered later militate against this control. </p>

<blockquote>There is a body of research that has created <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>between the concept that information and power means 'control' over <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>life. This control is 'denied' to people with disabilities in the initial stages of their coming to terms with their disability. The concept of power that grows from persons with a disability being able to access information, as required, leads to their <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>rehabilitation and their regaining their sense of well-being. First, they must regain this sense of 'control', which may partially be <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>through the ability to access and share information (Bar-tal 1994; Folkman 1984 both cited in Tilley <em>et al.</em> <a href="#Tilley">2002</a>: 508).</blockquote>

<h3>Contexts for virtual communities - potential portals</h3>

<p>The other particularly significant themes or concepts that emerged from these interviews were the importance of empowerment, the seeking of 'fantasy' or virtual reality, the need and use of information, 'interest', relationship and transactions. The identification of these six phenomena or concepts were the building blocks of the theoretical model or <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that was useful to the users - Queenslanders with long-term physical disabilities - and the facilitators of such a virtual <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> They <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>potential portals.</p>

<p>If any one or more of these types of e-communities were to be ignored, then only fragments of the potential virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>experience would be available to persons with disabilities. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>also indicated that information and technological literacy enhanced access to the notion of a virtual <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> while costs of connecting and various physical and technological aspects caused barriers to a successful virtual <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> They included, for example, connection problems for rural and remote people, the 'isolation' double-edged sword issue and, the inaccessibility of chat rooms to people with physical disabilities.</p>

<p>The first type of e-community was the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or empowerment that created an <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for capacity building (or social capital) and bridged information literacy and the digital divide and tackled inequities and so forth. For this type of virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to be information literate, it had to provide the prerequisites for 'participating effectively in the Information Society, and is part of the basic human right of life long learning' (The Prague Declaration, <a href="#IMILE">2003</a>).</p>

<p>The second type of e-community was fantasy-oriented where users created new environments, personalities, stories and role-play and were <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to virtual reality 'activities' because of access and mobility issues. This had not emerged from the data as <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>relevant to the interviewees of this study, but nonetheless, it was a <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>under the guise of the double-edged sword; that is, access to particular experiences versus total isolation from such experience. I commented in a chat room that I was doing research into virtual communities for persons with physical disabilities and that I would like ideas about the following:</p>

<blockquote>'What is your secret wish? Assume that the Telecommunications and Information Technology industry is going to grant one wish to the disability sector. What should it be? It could be <span>hardware</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or <span>software</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>.. Any wish, no matter how way-out. Just as long as it relates to telephones, computers, the Internet and so on'. I asked for some background and for the respondent to be explicit about how this would benefit themselves or others in a similar <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></blockquote>

<p>One <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>was:</p>

<blockquote>I'd like to try cyber sex with one of those full body suits. I'd also give cyber-sky-diving a go, deep-sea diving, mountain climbing, body surfing - the lot. Stuff I can't do in real life. Virtual reality would bring my wildest fantasies to life.</blockquote>

<p>The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>type of e-community that emerged from the data was the information-oriented <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> The information-oriented <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> for example, <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>a personal understanding of the availability and applicability of assistive technology, specific health information for persons with disabilities, as well as information about accessible travel and <span>accommodation</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> in addition to all the other general informational needs that any <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>might exhibit. In this study, sometimes this <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>type of e-community overlapped with the fourth type of e-community,  the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of interest, but invariably it <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to be more 'personal'. Burnett contributed to the debate on virtual communities as information-oriented social <span>spaces</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and developed a model of information exchange in virtual communities and a typology of the varieties of information behaviour to be found in virtual communities. He also drew <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to the fact that virtual communities can function as forums for both information and social-emotional activities. He lamented the fact that little research had been undertaken to determine the relationship between these activities. He <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that it may be possible that social activities, however trivial, were used in online environments to exchange information of various <span>sorts</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> and that information sharing itself was a fundamentally social act (Burnett, <a href="#Burnett">2000</a>). Effectively, this study into a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for people with physical disabilities substantiated Burnett's thinking about virtual communities functioning as forums for both information and social-emotional activities, and as a means of accessing relatively <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>a wealth of information: the Internet may well excel.</p>

<p>It was the fourth type of <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> that is, the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of interest that was particularly relevant to the model developed for persons with physical disabilities. This was where members had a significantly higher <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>than in the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information and usually on the topics of their interest that were especially relevant to the more general group interests of the interviewees in this study. These communities usually had chat rooms, message boards, and discussion groups for <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>member <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Thus, they were characterised by a significant amount of user-generated content on topics of moral purpose, disability rights, bioethics and such specific issues.</p>

<p>The fifth type of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>'relationship' was built around certain life experiences that were usually very intense and led to personal bonding between members. Again, when asked the same question about a secret wish, one <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>responded: 'It's not really a secret wish - <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>Internet Service Provider access for all people with disabilities'. She clarified:</p>

<blockquote>This is not really a secret wish but a very <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>one and one that has the potential to impact on people with disabilities in all areas of Australia. Today, people can use voice-activated programs to communicate, where once this was not possible. So let's hear it for a push to energise and empower the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for e-mail and Internet provision for people with disabilities in Australia and provided <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>as a service to those who otherwise could not access the world.</blockquote>

<p>The sixth and what may be described as the transaction-oriented communities primarily facilitated the buying and selling of products and services and delivered information that was related to fulfilling those transactions. These communities did not address the member's social needs in any manner. Indeed, there was little, or no <span>interaction</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> between members, the communities  existed solely either to transact <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or to provide informational leads or consultations about other possible participants in financial transactions.</p>

<h3>Barriers and enablers for virtual communities for the disabled</h3>

<p>The interviewees identified four <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>types of barriers to people with disabilities forming successful virtual communities, costs, physical, technological and social barriers. The diversity and <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of barriers identified by interviewees <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>their successful use of information and communication technologies. Most of the interviewees were aware of barriers such as connection problems for rural and remote people, the 'isolation' double-edged sword issue and the inaccessibility of chat rooms to people with physical disabilities. Other barriers included costs because most people with disabilities have <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>economic resources. Some of the cost barriers identified included the set-up costs for the <span>hardware</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(for example, voice recognition), assistive technology, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) and the on-going telecommunication cost, which may include broadband. On the other hand, they suggested some <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to the cost barriers such as cheap, recycled 'green' computers.</p>

<p>Information literacy skills are fundamental to the success of a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for persons with long-term, severe, physical disabilities. Information literacy can contribute to participative citizenship, social inclusion, <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of skills, innovation and enterprise, the creation of new knowledge, personal, vocational, corporate and organisational empowerment and learning for life (<a href="#ALIA">ALIA 2003</a>). While this definition of information literacy affords an insight into the notions encompassed by the <span>term</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> there are several 'faces' of information literacy <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>embracing (<a href="#Bruce">Bruce 1997</a>.

The Council of Australian University Librarians (CAUL) adopted the Australian School Library Association (ASLA) Statement on Information Literacy in 1994. The Australian Library and Information Association (ALIA) adopted their policy statement on 'information literacy' for all Australians in 2001 and amended it in 2003 (ALIA, <a href="#ALIA">2003</a>). Information literacy promotes the <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>flow of information and ideas in the interest of all Australians and a thriving culture, economy and democracy. ALIA <span>believes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that a thriving national and global culture, economy and democracy, will be <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>best by the people who recognise their need for information. They also need to be able to identify, locate, access, evaluate and apply that information. The interviewees in this study were intuitively aware of their need for information and to be information and technologically literate as deemed desirable according to the 'Thematic Debate on Information Literacy' (UNESCO, <a href="#UNESCO">2005</a>).</p>

<p>Some of the more serious telecommunications issues and barriers for consumers with disabilities highlighted by the interviewees were the fact that the telecommunications product market was inaccessible, complex and confusing. Frequently, there was a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge on the part of staff about the telecommunications products they sold.

<h2>Discussion and conclusions</h2>

<p>This study is unique in that a conceptual model was developed that would provide the platform for building a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that met the specific needs of persons with long-term, severe physical disabilities. The model is innovative, sustainable and, if used to help guide the development and implementation of environments that support virtual communities it would be likely to lead to reduced social isolation for people with physical disabilities and would be transferable across communities to some other disability types and timeframes. It was <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that this theoretical model of 'best practice' also contributed to the <span>reduction</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of social isolation of other population groups, for example, older people.</p>

<p>The Association for <span>Computing</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>Machinery - Computer-Human Interaction Conference (ACM-CHI) in 1997 identified the five necessary multi-disciplinary <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of a virtual <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> These <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are compared, below, with the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>from this study:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>ACM-HCI:</strong> members have a shared goal, interest, need, or activity that provides the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>reason for belonging to the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> <br />
<strong>This study:</strong>  it became apparent that the shared goal, interest, need, or activity for Queenslanders with long-term, severe, physical disabilities derived from the grounded theory 'phenomena' that featured in all their interviews to regain 'a sense of control' over their lives.</li> 

<li><strong>ACM-HCI:</strong> members engage in repeated, active participation; often, intense <span>interactions</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> strong emotional ties, and shared activities <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>among participants.<br /> 
<strong>This study:</strong> it is likely that members of that virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>would engage in repeated, active participation accessing their shared online communities that support sociability through shared areas of need and interest (Burnett <a href="#Burnett">2000</a>).</li> 

<li><strong>ACM-HCI:</strong> members have access to shared resources, and policies determine the access to those resources.<br /> 
<strong>This study:</strong> the members would have access to shared resources through the portals, and they would monitor the policies that governed access to those resources. According to grounded theory, the policies would be described or determined by the 'properties'.</li> 

<li><strong>ACM-HCI:</strong> reciprocity of information, support, and services among members is important.<br /> 
<strong>This study:</strong> indicated that members they would reciprocate information, support and services through discussion groups. The 'sub-categories' of grounded theory would define the nature of the information exchanged.</li> 

<li><strong>ACM-HCI:</strong> there is a shared context of social conventions, language, and protocols.<br /> 
<strong>This study:</strong> confirmed that there would be a shared context of social conventions, language, and protocols based on shared experiences pertaining to technology, disability, and so forth (Whittaker, <em>et al.</em> <a href="#Whittaker">1997</a>). It would be the 'dimensions' of grounded theory that would outline their social conventions, language, and protocols. </li></ul>

<p>The model outlined above upholds the five necessary multi-disciplinary <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>as defined at the ACM-CHI Conference. It highlighted that access, equity, participation and self-empowerment were <span>absolutely</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to any virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for persons with disabilities.</p>

<p>Schuler presented core <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and their attributes for <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>networks as democracy, <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> health, equality, information exchange and communication. He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>They must <span>rest</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <span>solid</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>foundations of principles and <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and be flexible and adaptable, intelligent, and creative. They must be inclusive. Everyone must be allowed to participate. They will have to engage both governments and <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>because they both exist to provide services for people. These institutions must be accountable to the people, and not the reverse (Schuler, <a href="#Schuler">1996</a>: xi).</blockquote>

<p>In this study into the needs or <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or communities for Queenslanders with a physical disability, the six <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>characteristics or concepts were identified as <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or empowerment, fantasy or virtual activity, information, interest, relationship and transaction. Thus, the needs or <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for Queenslanders with a physical disability <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>lined up with the core <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that Schuler identified for building <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>networks.</p>

<p>The <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of virtual communities provided by Burnett (<a href="#burnett">2000</a>) and Chang, <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#chang">1999</a>) are not, in fact, challenged or modified by the conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or model for a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>presented here. In the process of developing the model, it was demonstrated how access to information and communications technology, information literacy development, telecommunications and bridging the digital divide, were all <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>components of a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for people with physical disabilities. Indeed, for many such persons all these components were equally vital to their social and economic life. Additional to the general information and communications technology <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that enabled the formation of such a successful virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>were a variety of <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of particular interest to those with mobility restrictions, for example, the elderly. These included alternate <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of communication and information access and <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and the opportunity to undertake activities and transactions from the home and remote access to care and other support services. Information services, tele-shopping, transactions like tele-banking and remote access to entertainment and other leisure pursuits, such as, video-on-demand <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>new possibilities.</p>

<p>The outcomes are general and applicable to other groups. The adaptation of many of these <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on information and communications technology in this specific area also indicated wider application. Sectors within a global <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>needed to be served particularly and many of the <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>identified in this study have served as guideposts for a <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>serving all types of groups. However, some of the investigations undertaken in this study highlighted a number of serious telecommunications issues or barriers for consumers with disabilities that warranted addressing. We believe that it is <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that the Commonwealth Government, individual carriers and carriage service providers, and the Australian Communications Industry Forum continue to work closely with Telecommunications Disability Advisory Bodies to address and act to resolve these issues.</p>

<p>In <span>conclusion</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> on the basis of this theory, the study proposed <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for implementing a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>model based on user information needs for people with long-term physical or mobility disabilities. The <span>conclusion</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of this study was that the technology itself could provide <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for independence and thus facilitate self-empowerment. However, the process that gives 'a sense of control' and is empowering is also capable of being dis-empowering. Empowerment and dis-empowerment are intersecting processes because of digital divide and information literacy issues and the fact that virtual reality for people with physical disabilities may be a 'double-edged sword'. Based on the new knowledge and the theory as the outcomes of this study, a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of recommendations that have application in the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>were available.</p>

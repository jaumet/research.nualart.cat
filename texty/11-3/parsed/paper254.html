<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A diagnosis of cancer is a stressful life experience. The nature of the disease <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>patients to learn about the illness, make difficult decisions regarding ensuing treatment, and cope with the <span>consequences</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of the illness. It has been found that having relevant information not only helps cancer patients to understand the disease, but it also facilitates their decision-making and coping (<a href="#cassileth80">Cassileth <em>et al.</em> 1980</a>, <a href="#iconomou">Iconomou <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>). Graydon <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#graydon">1997</a>) have postulated five categories for information needs among breast cancer patients: 1) nature of disease, its process and prognosis, 2) cancer <span>treatments</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> 3) investigative <span>tests</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> 4) preventive, restorative, and maintenance physical care and 5) patient's or family's psychosocial <span>concerns</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> Degner <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#degner">1997</a>) developed nine categories of information needs among cancer patients: 1) spread of the disease, 2) likelihood of cure, 3) treatment options, 4) 0e-effects of treatment, 5) effect on family and friends, 6) risk of disease to family, 7) impact on work, daily activities, and social life, 8) self-care issues and 9) sexual <span>concerns</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> Similar categories have been developed by other researchers.</p>

<p>Where do these patients get this much-needed information? Only a <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>number of studies have examined the information sources that cancer patients use to seek needed information. For example, Rees and Bath (<a href="#rees">2000a</a>), in a review of the literature on the information behaviour of breast cancer patients and family members from 1988 to 1998, could only find four studies on the use of information sources by breast cancer patients. More studies are certainly required on this <span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> Understanding the <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use among cancer patients is important because interventions are needed to ensure that these patients are exposed to a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of information sources and are substantially informed about the management of this complex disease (<a href="#schapira">Schapira <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>).</p>

<p>More recent research indicates that cancer patients, during their illness, have a variety of information sources available to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the information needed to learn, decide, adjust and cope. Medical professionals, such as physicians, nurses, chemotherapy and radiotherapy staff, are <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to be <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and important sources of information for the patients. Although different medical professionals <span>possess</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>varying levels of medical knowledge, these sources are generally well-informed and well-placed to provide information to patients while caring for them. In addition to conveying oral information during <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>with patients, health care professionals present their knowledge to consumers through pamphlets, Web sites, medical books and articles in journals. Research shows that patients diagnosed with cancer may supplement the information obtained from these sources with that from various non-medical information sources: family and/or friends, fellow cancer patients, support groups, magazines, television, radio and newspapers.</p>

<p>More recent research (<a href="#mills">Mills &amp; <span>Davidson</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>2002</a>; <a href="#raupach">Raupach and Hiller 2002</a>) indicates that cancer patients, during their illness, have a variety of information sources available to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the information needed to learn, decide, adjust and cope. Medical professionals, such as physicians, nurses, chemotherapy and radiotherapy staff, are <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to be <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and important sources of information for the patients (<a href="#luker">Luker <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>; <a href="#mills">Mills and <span>Davidson</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>2002</a>). Although different medical professionals <span>possess</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>varying levels of medical knowledge, these sources are generally well-informed and well-placed to provide information to patients while caring for them. In addition to conveying oral information during <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>with patients, health care professionals present their knowledge to consumers through pamphlets (<a href="#davison">Davison <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>), Web sites (<a href="#katz"> Katz <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>), medical books (<a href="#ameXX">American Cancer Society n.d.</a>) and articles in journals (<a href="#amedXX">American Medical Association n.d.</a>). Research shows (<a href="#carlsson">
Carlsson 2000</a>, <a href="#mills">Mills and <span>Davidson</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>2002</a>, <a href="#raupach">Raupach and Hiller 2002</a>, <a href="#turk-charles">Turk-Charles <em>et al.</em> 1997</a>) that patients diagnosed with cancer may supplement the information obtained from these sources with that from various non-medical information sources: family and/or friends, fellow cancer patients, support groups, magazines, television, radio and newspapers.</p>

<p>Among these sources, the mass media sources&mdash;magazines, television, radio, newspapers, books, journals, pamphlets, and Web sites&mdash;in particular, allow for <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>passive information reception in addition to active information seeking (<a href="#carlsson">Carlsson 2000</a>). For instance, there is greater chance of passive information reception from magazines, newspapers, television, and radio. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>patient could be watching the news on television and may receive cancer-related information without making a conscious effort to find the information. In <span>comparison</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> the information seeking from Web sites is often active; that is, the patients have to make a conscious effort to find cancer-related information, as they also would when they read books, refer to narratives (accounts of patient experience), peruse pamphlets, or contact telephone helplines. These alternate <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>facilitate greater access.</p>

<p>Mass media sources vary in <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>because of the differences in <span>rigour</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of dissemination processes which they undergo. Content presented through magazines, television, radio, newspapers, and Web sites, especially that produced <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>health care settings, may convey misleading and inaccurate information (<a href="#seidman">
Seidman <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>). More <span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>are mass media sources, such as medical books, journals, and pamphlets, which are often geared towards specific audiences and are communicated by health care professionals through more <span>rigorous</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>dissemination processes. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>caveat is that medical books and journals may be difficult for some patients to read. Even educational pamphlets, which are <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>targeted toward patients, have often been criticized for being pitched at the <span>wrong</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>educational level (<a href="#folz">Foltz and Sullivan 1996</a>). All written materials, however, have the advantage of allowing the patient to review and <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the material in the <span>future</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Interpersonal sources, on the other hand, have the potential to be more effective in communication. For instance, family and friends, although lay sources, are trusted information sources readily available to the patients and are <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in the coping process (<a href="#luker">Luker <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>). Similarly, other cancer patients can provide comfort through sharing personal experiences although these may sometimes be outdated experiences (<a href="schapirahtml.html">Schapira <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>). Also, support groups, like family and friends, can be instrumental in helping patients cope with the illness (<a href="#edgar">Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>).</p>

<p>Current research literature indicates that cancer patients, through the stages of diagnosis, treatment, and post-treatment, tend to use a <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of these information sources (<a href="#mills">Mills and <span>Davidson</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>2002</a>), both medical and non-medical, including mass media and interpersonal, each of which present different advantages for use; that is, the patients do not simply receive information from one or two sources. In addition, cancer patients' use of these information sources has been known to vary based on individual patient <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and the situations patients find themselves in during the illness (<a href="#mills">Mills and <span>Davidson</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>2002</a>; <a href="#raupach">Raupach and Hiller 2002</a>). According to the literature, age, gender, and <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>are patient <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>which can affect use of information sources by this patient group (<a href="#bil96">
Bilodeau and Degner 1996</a>; <a href="#mills">Mills and <span>Davidson</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>2002</a>). Similarly, according to the literature (<a href="#bil96">Bilodeau and Degner 1996</a>; <a href="#raupach">Raupach and Hiller 2002</a>), these patients' use of information sources can be <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>by situational variables, such as stage of cancer at diagnosis, time passed since being diagnosed with cancer, their preference for a role in decision-making related to illness, and the type of treatment that they are undergoing.</p>

<p>In this study, the author conducted a systematic review of existing studies on information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use by cancer patients. The systematic review, although underutilized in library and information science, is a widely applied method in medicine, <span>psychology</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> and <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>among other disciplines to synthesize and summarize existing quantitative data related to a research problem. When mathematical <span>computation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>is employed to synthesize data, a systematic review is con0ered a meta-analysis. <span>Mathematical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>amalgamation, however, is not a requirement for systematic reviews. Systematic reviews can be conducted, as in this study, by summarizing the quantitative results of existing studies and by drawings conclusions about what the results mean as a body of literature.</p>

<p>The method was applied to: 1) gather existing data on use of information sources and variations in use of information sources according to patient demographics and patient situational variables and to, 2) summarize the frequency of use of specific information sources, perceived helpfulness of specific information sources, and relationships between demographic and situational variables and information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use across studies in the literature. <span>Quantitative</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>data representative of the above were gathered from individual studies across the literature. Subsequently, data were summarized to show what the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>related to different research questions from independent studies mean as a body of literature. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>synthesis of the results will, as <span>intended</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> provide guidance for interventions <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to ensure that patients are exposed to a number of information sources set in place to impart much needed information in the management of a complex disease. For instance, the review will tell us whether or not individual <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>should be taken into con0eration in directing patients to information sources, or whether or not situations during the illness should lead to context-based <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of information sources for patients. Do the information sources which are preferred by patients <span>possess</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>certain <span>qualities</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>that we can understand and emulate in information provision? Is there something we can do about important information sources that are underutilized? Most importantly, perhaps we can understand what patients <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>helpful and incorporate these <span>qualities</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in information delivery.</p>

<p>The following research questions guided the probe for gathering and summarizing data:</p>

<ol>
<li>Which information sources are most used by cancer patients in seeking information? 
<li>Which information sources are least used by cancer patients in seeking information? 
<li>Which information sources do cancer patients find helpful? 
<li>What is the influence of patient demographics, such as age, sex, and <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> on cancer patients' <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of information sources? 
<li>What is the influence of patient situational variables – stage of illness at diagnosis, time elapsed since diagnosis, role preferred in decision-making regarding illness, and type of treatment being received – on cancer patients' <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of information sources?</li></ol>

<h2>Procedures</h2>

<p>A systematic review was conducted to synthesize results from previous studies on the use of information sources by cancer patients. It is the first of its kind in analysing the concepts covered herein. As discussed above, the systematic review as a method is an organized approach where <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>results from related studies that already exist on a <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>are combined to reach conclusions. When the results are mathematically combined, the systematic review is called a meta-analysis (<a href="#ankem">Ankem 2005</a>); however, a mathematical amalgamation is not a requirement for a systematic review. In this study, a systematic review was conducted by analysing and presenting the analytics in synthesis; that is, without the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>mathematical <span>combination</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of systematic review as a research method can be found in an article by Carr (<a href="#carr">2002</a>). In addition to Carr's article, several <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of the method can be retrieved from the <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/index0.htm" target="_blank">Cochrane Collaboration</a> database which is dedicated to providing access to systematic reviews. One such review of a different aspect of information provision&mdash;methods of information giving&mdash;was <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to ensure procedural <span>accuracy</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in conducting a systematic review (<a href="#mcpherson">McPherson <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>).</p>

<p>This author embarked on a sizeable project to synthesize literature on cancer patients' information needs, information seeking, and information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>meta-analysis of factors affecting cancer patients' level of information needs and a systematic review of their need for specific types of information have been completed. In the project, this article is a paper which probes the use of information sources by cancer patients. As in one of the other papers, given the number of studies available and the nature of existing <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>results related to the research questions examined in this paper, a systematic review was deemed to be a more <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>method than a meta-analysis.</p>

<p>To commence review, online databases, Medline and CINAHL, were searched. The first <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in Medline and CINAHL was with the subject heading neoplasm (with the explode function) which was combined using the <span>Boolean</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>'OR' with the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>cancer patients (in the title, <span>abstract</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> MESH subject heading, and CAS registry and EC number word) to retrieve studies on cancer patients. This <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>was combined with several <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>searches using the following terms: information need(s), information seeking, information seeking behaviour, information source(s), and information resource(s) (in the title, <span>abstract</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> Mesh subject heading, and CAS registry/EC number word) to retrieve studies only on cancer patients’ information needs, seeking, and use. The final <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>was <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>language, adults, and the years 1993-2003. Additionally, the final <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in CINAHL was <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to research studies. These final searches produced 196 articles in Medline and 283 articles in CINAHL which included studies conducted in countries other than the United States. The reasons for <span>limiting</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the literature <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to a ten-year <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>from 1993 to 2003 were (1) the development of new information sources, such as web sites, within the past decade and 2) the consequential change in information behaviour among consumers who want more information.</p>

<p>Based on this author’s prior knowledge, Medline and CINAHL are the only databases that point to information seeking studies that were conducted with <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>cancer patients and that were published during 1993-2003. However, searches similar to those conducted in Medline and CINAHL were carried in <span>LISA</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to find research on the topics of interest published during 1993-2003. The <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>cancer patients (in the title, <span>abstract</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> and descriptors) was combined separately with searches on the terms information need(s), information seeking, information seeking behaviur, information source(s), and information resource(s) (all in the title, <span>abstract</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> and descriptors). These searches did not produce any publications of studies on information needs, seeking, or use with <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>cancer patients. To have an idea of the coverage of research on the topics of interest generally in <span>LISA</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>  the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>was broadened to only the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>cancer patients (in the title, <span>abstract</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> and descriptors) to retrieve all studies related to cancer patients published during 1993-2003. This broader <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>produced 38 publications. Several of these studies, however, focused on the information sources <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>for cancer patients without <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>cancer patients in the studies. Only three studies included cancer patients as participants, and in two of the three, patients' <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of information technology in health care delivery were examined. Only one study (<a href="#reesb">
Rees and Bath, 2000b</a>) was somewhat related to the topics of interest in this author’s project. Rees and Bath’s article examines advantages and disadvantages of various information sources as viewed by <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>cancer  patients participating in the study. It was determined that even this study does not <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>with information needs, seeking, or use among cancer patients.</p>

<p>The process of identifying results is the most painstaking and time-consuming part of conducting a systematic review. To identify studies on the <span>topic</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> the titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles were perused. This led to the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of 110 publications on information needs and information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use. As the present study was part of a <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>study, literature on information needs was included in the review at an early stage, but was separated later. In a systematic review, several criteria are <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><em>a priori</em> to find specific studies that will provide pertinent data for the review. At this point, the general criteria <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>for the inclusion of studies were: (1) examination of information needs of cancer patients or information sources used by cancer patients, (2) inclusion of adults as subjects in the study (the age restriction in searching had retrieved a study with 17-year olds), and (3) application of quantitative research methods and statistics: any statistic to convey need for information or use of an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>inferential</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>statistics, in particular, to convey a relationship between a demographic or situational <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and need for information or use of an information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> Demographic <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>con0ered relevant were age, <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> and sex while situational <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>con0ered relevant were: time since diagnosis, stage of cancer, type of treatment received, and patient's preferred role in making illness-related decisions. The above review led to the elimination of thirty-five more papers that dealt with <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>studies on information needs, evaluation of general communication channels or site specific cancer information-oriented programmes, breast cancer risk, hereditary breast cancer and genetic <span>testing</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> prevention and screening, symptoms before diagnosis, information needs before breast biopsy, <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of life during cancer, coping during cancer, and impact of a particular information provider, such as the Cancer Information Service (CIS).</p>

<p>Most systematic reviews analyse quantitative results from clinical <span>trials</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> This is not to say that <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>results must be excluded as they can be <span>synthesized</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>separately. This study, in the popular approach, is <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to synthesis of quantitative results.</p>

<p>The remaining seventy-five articles were critically read for specific data on the use of information sources by cancer patients and the relationship, if any, between their demographics and situations and their use of a certain information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> From these remaining articles, twelve were selected. All of the papers that dealt solely with information needs were separated for other research studies. One article was removed because the information sources analysed were too few and all the sources covered were within health care which would not allow for meaningful <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>with the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of information sources covered in other papers. To include studies on patient information seeking activities&mdash;both for facts and advice&mdash;from several information sources that are the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>here, a careful distinction was made to <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and remove studies on patient educational activities which are often about a specific educational programme from a provider <span>perspective</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><p>

<p>Also, in the pool of sixty-three papers removed were those that dealt with the following topics, which were not <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>relevant to the present systematic review:</p>

</ul>

<p>In the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of the twelve studies for the systematic review, no distinction was made between types of cancer. The <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>pool of studies retrieved through the literature <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>examined patients diagnosed with heterogeneous types of cancer. The publications selected were all peer-reviewed journal articles authored by researchers in medicine, nursing, public health, pharmacy, <span>psychology</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> psychiatry, and physical therapy. Sample sizes in individual studies ranged from 75 to 334. The majority of <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>sizes, however, ranged from 105 to 160.</p>

<h3>Measurement of use of information sources, demographics, and situations</h3>

<p>A discussion of measurement of variables follows to justify the inclusion of the twelve studies in the systematic review, as it is important in such a review that variables of interest to a research question are comparable across studies. Most questionnaires that captured information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use were <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>specifically for a study; thus, they were not standardized <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>but were based on earlier psychometric literature. For instance, <span>Dunn</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><em>et al.</em>'s (<a href="#dunn">1999</a>) <span>instrument</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>was based on work by Cassileth <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#Cassileth85">1985</a>), and Mills and <span>Davidson</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>s (<a href="#mills">2002</a>) <span>instrument</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>titled Information Sources Questionnaire was based on work by Luker <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#luker">1996</a>). Face or content validity of these <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>is discussed in the articles. Overall, <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>instruments in <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>different studies were tested, and the researchers (<a href="#biley">Biley <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>; <a href="#bosompra">Bosompra <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>; <a href="#mills">Mills and <span>Davidson</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>2002</a>; <a href="#raupach">Raupach and Hiller 2002</a>; <a href="#schapira">Schapira <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>; <a href="#steginga">Steginga <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>; <a href="#turk-charles">Turk-Charles <em>et al.</em> 1997</a>) report reliability for three of these: the two <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>administered by Bosompra et al. (2001) and Steginga <em>et al.</em> (2002) and the <span>instrument</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>administered by Turk-Charles <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#turk-charles">1997</a>) to gather data on non-medical information seeking by cancer patients. The <span>instrument</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>appearing in the Turk-Charles <em>et al.</em> study to measure non-medical information seeking was a counterpart to another <span>instrument</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>that they employed to gather data on patients’ medical establishment information seeking. The latter of the two <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>employed by Turk-Charles <em>et al.</em> was based on the Krantz Health Opinion Survey for which reliability has been widely reported in the literature.</p>

<p>All <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>focused on the frequency of use of specific information sources. Usually, respondents are provided with a <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of sources and asked to <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>whether they had used the sources. Turk-Charles <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#turk-charles">1997</a>), <span>instead</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> tapped into the frequency of use using "...a Likert scale for each type of non-medical information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>(newspaper, television, and friends) and medical information sources
(physicians and nurses).". The data thus gathered were applied only towards examining a relationship between demographic variables and use of information sources, not for ranking use of information sources.<p>

<p>While a more in-depth approach to the study of use can certainly be facilitated by <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>research, administering predetermined lists is an acceptable approach in the quantitative research tradition. In a different approach to the common listing of information sources submitted to patients, Steginga <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#steginga">2002</a>), <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of giving a <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of information sources, asked the patients to provide information sources that they had used in making treatment decisions. Although quantitative, this approach was deemed different from all others, and the Steginga <em>et al.</em> study was included in the systematic review for summarizing most used but not for summarizing least used information sources because it is possible that patients may not think of mentioning an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>used infrequently or used only once.</p>

<p>In tapping the helpfulness of information sources, one approach to measurement was gathering the frequency with which patients attached usefulness to information sources, gained satisfaction through information sources, or attached importance to information sources. Another way to measure this concept was on a Likert scale of helpfulness for various information sources (<a href="#schapira">Schapira <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>). As the above concepts were all con0ered to be closely identified with helpfulness, the results from the studies examining any of these concepts within the context of information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use were to be included in the systematic review for the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of ranking most helpful information sources. Perceived <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>was not con0ered a similar concept because the idea of <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>can be somewhat removed from the relevance that an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>has for an individual. An individual can think of an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to be of high <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>without ever using it or having any intention to use it. Alternatively, an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>thought to be important to an individual has more chance of use, thus, being useful or helpful.</p>

<p>The following is a <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of the measurement of variables found in examining relationships between patient demographics and situations and use of information sources. Age was <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>either as a categorical variable (age ranges provided for the patient to select from) or a continuous variable (the <span>exact</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>age of the patient).  Education and sex were <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>as categorical variables. Educational categories were <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>school, upper <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>school, and university <span>degree</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> Sex was categorized as either male or female. Among situational variables, 'time since diagnosis' was <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>as a categorical variable in intervals of time. Raupach and Hiller (<a href="#raupach">2002</a>) <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>time since diagnosis in six-month intervals ranging, in total, from six months  to thirty months. The researchers gathered the frequency of use of various information sources for each time <span>period</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> Certain situational variables&mdash;stage of illness, patient preference for role in decision-making, and type of treatment&mdash;were discovered to be overlooked in relation to use of information sources in the literature. Actually, of the demographic and situational determinants of information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use, only the relationship of age to information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use was examined in more than one study.</p>

<h3>Data extraction</h3>

<p>Before data were extracted and categorized from individual studies for ranking, a <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of information sources was developed to collate information sources that were too specific into a broader category that would be sufficiently <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>from other categories and be meaningful for ranking <span>purposes</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> The eleven categories developed were:</p>

<ol>
<li>health care professionals;</li>
<li>professionals in areas allied with health care, such as social work and psychology; </li>
<li>broadcast and print journalism media, such as television, radio, newspapers, and magazines; </li>
<li>books and journals; </li>
<li>medical patient educational materials in various formats, including pamphlets; </li>
<li>support groups; </li>
<li>family and/or friends; </li>
<li>other cancer patients; </li>
<li>Internet; </li>
<li>library; and </li>
<li>all other information sources.</li>
</ol> 

<p>The first ten categories were all derived from the literature on cancer patients' information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use. The eleventh category 'other information sources' was included in this systematic review to accommodate information sources infrequently examined in the literature.</p>

<p>Frequency of use was usually <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in percentages in individual studies. In conjunction with the <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of eleven information sources mentioned in the previous paragraph, these percentages were employed to arrive at the three most used information sources noted by patients from each study. The procedure was as follows. Taking Schapira <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#schapira">1999</a>) as an example, this study ranked 'urologist' as first in information sources used, so 'urologist' was ranked first in the systematic review as well (<a href="#tab1">
see Table 1</a>).  'Written pamphlets' was ranked second in information sources used, which fell under our broader 'medical patient educational materials' and was different from 'urologist' which fell under our 'health care professionals,' so the 'written pamphlets' were placed in the second column as second in ranking in this systematic review. 'Radiation oncologist' was ranked <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in information sources used, but this fell under our broader 'health care professionals' which had already been ranked first; guided by the fact that one of the health care professionals was ranked first in the study, 'radiation oncologist' was also included as first in ranking in this systematic review. To show the researcher's original ranking in the individual study to the reader, the ranking from the study was entered next to each information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in parentheses. Hence, while 'urologist' and 'radiation oncologist' were  entered as first in ranking in this review, the researcher's original ranks (1) and (3), <span>respectively</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> are included in parentheses next to the items (<a href="#tab1">Table 1</a>).</p>

<p>The next <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in the Schapira <em>et al.</em> study was 'family' which fell under our broader 'family and friends' and was different from the other information sources already entered. Therefore, 'family' was entered in the <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>column for ranking as <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in this review (Table 1). The approach allowed the collation of, for instance, 'urologist' and 'radiation oncologist' into 'health care professionals', a more identifiable information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>that was <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>from the other information sources, 'medical patient educational materials' and 'family', that were ranked second and <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in use in this study. This process was <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>until the three most used information sources were extracted from each study for the systematic review. The idea was to synthesize what already exists in the literature in terms of use. Hence, the result will be a reflection of what has already been found, and no presumption is made that a certain <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of information sources, or one <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>complemented by other sources, is the best in providing information to cancer patients. Also, no distinction was made as to whether facts or advice were received from an information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Similar techniques were applied to extract data from articles and to organize data for ranking <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>so that the two least used information sources (by working in the <span>opposite</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of frequency of use and ranking from the bottom-up) and the three most helpful information sources as perceived by cancer patients who participated in the studies could be determined. Again, the idea was not to find that a particular <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>was less used than generally expected: the intention was to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>what the literature says about information sources that have been less used by cancer patients. In this case, the aim was to identify two information sources least used by less than 30% of the participants, which was the cutoff point based on percentages of low use in the studies.</p> 

<p>For example, pamphlets and the Internet <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>as <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>sources, and that is how they were categorized for analysis. The latter was assumed to be general cancer information sites on the Internet and the former a medical pamphlet in print distributed by health care organizations. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>support group was thought to be an <span>entity</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>established to assist patients in coping, but was also capable of providing helpful information in any format.</p>

<p>In addition, as Tables 1-3 show, data concerning the type of information <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>by patients, the time of information seeking during their illness (if available), cancer diagnosis of participating patients, and statistics of information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use were also extracted from each study. The type of information patients <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and the time element of information seeking, especially, add an important dimension to information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use which will be revisited in the results and <span>conclusion</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in providing suggestions for <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>research.</p>

<p>To extract data on factors affecting use of information sources, any relationship between demographics and situational variables&mdash;age, <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> sex, stage of disease, patient's decision-making <span>style</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> time since diagnosis, and type of treatment received&mdash;and use of an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>among cancer patients, if available, was recorded. Relationships between factors and information use <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>only in <span>inferential</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>statistics were entered (see Tables 4-5). Again, to provide a context for the use of information sources, data concerning cancer diagnosis of participating patients was extracted and entered. Also, it was deemed important to show the measurement and analysis within individual studies. Therefore, descriptions of <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>administered for gathering data on frequency of information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use (when available) and statistics employed to analyse relationships of patient demographics and/or situations to information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use within studies were also extracted and entered.</p>

<p>The synthesis was guided by the data within each <span>table</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> which summarizes results from related studies relating to a research question. The three most used information sources extracted from each study are presented in Table 1. In addition, Table 1 includes the type of information patients needed or <span>sought</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> the point in time during illness at which they needed or <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the information as covered in the study, and the type of cancer with which the patients were diagnosed. The first two variables, in particular, provide a context for information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use by patients. Tables 2 and 3 are similar, but present, <span>respectively</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> the lesser used information sources and the most helpful information sources.</p>

<p>Table 4 illustrates the effect of demographics&mdash;age, <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and sex&mdash;on use of an information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> Again, along with pertinent results from each study, the <span>table</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>presents the cancer diagnosis of patients within each study. Also, the <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>administered for measurement and data gathering and the <span>inferential</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>statistic applied to study the effect of demographics on information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use are included. Age is the only demographic to have been analysed in more than one study. The last <span>table</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> Table 5, is similar to Table 4 but shows the effect of situations on information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use. As can be seen, 'time since diagnosis' is the only variable to have been covered in the literature and in only one study. The type of information patients needed or <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and the time during which they needed or <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the information, which provide context for patients' use of information sources, in studies appearing in Tables 4-5, can be found in earlier <span>tables</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>when the studies provide such data. Both Table 4 and Table 5, summarize results, across studies, pertinent to a research question and illustrate what the results mean as a body of literature.</p>

<h3>The three most used information sources among cancer patients</h3>

<p>As <span>expected</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> health care professionals were the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>source of information for most cancer patients (Table 1) (<a href="#bosompra">Bosompra <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>, <a href="#carlsson">Carlsson 2000</a>, <a href="#mills">Mills and <span>Davidson</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>2002</a>, <a href="#nair">Nair <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>, <a href="#raupach">Raupach and Hiller 2002</a>, <a href="#schapira">Schapira <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>, <a href="#steginga">Steginga <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>).

<p>After health care professionals, medical pamphlets, which are <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to educate cancer patients and are provided to patients in health care settings were the most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>used information sources (<a href="#biley">Biley <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>, <a href="#davison">Davison <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>, <a href="#schapira">Schapira <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>). The ranking was based on patients' reported use of medical pamphlets in three individual studies. In the review these were taken to be more specific than 'readings' (reported in the study by <a href="#nair">Nair <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>),  which could have covered more diverse written materials. Similarly, the 'leaflets' reported in the study by Biley <em>et al.</em>, were taken to be more specific written materials.</p>


<p>In the analysis of the studies, family and friends were ranked <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in use as an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>by cancer patients (<a href="#carlsson">Carlsson 2000</a>, <a href="#nair">Nair <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>, <a href="#schapira">Schapira <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>, <a href="#steginga">Steginga <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>). The studies show that family and friends are a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>for information for these patients and not simply a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of support. Thus, overall, in descending order of use, health care professionals, medical pamphlets, and family and friends were found to be the three information sources patients diagnosed with cancer most often consult for information.</p>

<p>The number of patients who received information from health care professionals was rather high, ranging from 86% to 100%. One study (<a href="#bosompra">Bosompra <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>), which had a slightly different <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>on the time of <span>interaction</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> reported that 35% received information from health care professionals. The proportion of patients who used pamphlets to get information ranged from 34% to 79%. The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>category, those who rely on family and friends for information, <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>close behind, with the scores ranging from 46% to 55%. One exception was a study which showed 32% had received information from people in their lives (<a href="#steginga">Steginga <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>).</p>

<p>Table 1 also provides the context for each study that examined the use of information sources by cancer patients. Only five studies examined type of information needed or <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>by cancer patients. Of these, researchers of three studies <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves to one to three types of information to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>on whereas the researchers of the other two studies categorized all information <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>by cancer patients into several types as they conceived them. Details of types of information in all five studies can be found in Table 1. It is important to note that no study tied the types of information needed or <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to varying information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use; that is, there was no probing of which information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>is used for which type of information. As for time during illness, different studies focused on different points ranging from diagnosis to post-treatment. All points of illness, such as diagnosis, pre-treatment, initial stage of treatment, mid stage of treatment, latter stage of treatment, and post-treatment, were never covered in any one study. The use of information sources at different times during illness was examined in only one study, discussed later in this systematic review in the section on the impact of <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>on information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use. </p>

<h3>Information sources least used by cancer patients</h3>

<p>The Internet was clearly cancer patients' least-used information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>(Table 2) (<a href="#carlsson">Carlsson 2000</a>, <a href="#mills">Mills and <span>Davidson</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>2002</a>, <a href="#raupach">Raupach and Hiller 2002</a>). The reader must keep in mind that although the literature reviewed was published between 1993 and 2003, the only some of the studies included the Internet as an option on the <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>provided to participants to probe how <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>it was used by patients. Table 2 shows the year of publication of the articles from which these results were extracted. Secondly, even though the Internet was not as much in use and certainly the Web, in particular, was not in use, by the general public in the early nineties, there were still Internet <span>tools</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> such as gopher, files on ftp <span>servers</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> and bulletin boards, which were used by a substantial number of people. By the mid-nineties, Internet use had certainly increased, and by the end of the decade, it had become prevalent. Regardless of these developments, in this review, a more recent article indicates that the elderly cancer patients did not use this information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>(Table 2).</p>

<p>Somewhat more in use than the Internet, but still in the bottom rank in use by cancer patients, were support groups (<a href="#edgar">Edgar <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>, <a href="#mills">Mills and <span>Davidson</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>2002</a>, <a href="#raupach">Raupach and Hiller 2002</a>) which can help patients cope with their illness. Again, this rating is very interesting because support groups were cited as the most helpful information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>(see below) by the few cancer patients who reported using them in one study (<a href="#raupach">Raupach and Hiller 2002</a>).</p>

<p>The number of patients who had used the Internet for information was very low, ranging from 4% to 10%, and the number that turned to support groups for information was higher, ranging from 5% to 28%. This leads us to question why the Internet and support groups, both important information sources, were not being used by cancer patients: this is addressed in the discussion section.</p>

<p>The context in which the individual studies of use of information sources were conducted, is also provided in Table 2. This has similar data to that presented in Table 1 because many of the same studies were used in analysing the most-used and least-used information sources. Table 2 shows that few studies focused on any particular type of information. Also, although many studies focused on some point in time during illness ranging from pre-treatment through treatment to post-treatment, almost none probed the connection between time periods and information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use.</p>

<h3>The most helpful information sources</h3>

<p>Both medical and other cancer-related books were cited as the most helpful (Table 3) (<a href="#carlsson">Carlsson 2000</a>, <a href="#schapira">Schapira <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>). Interestingly, books were not frequently-used information sources, and the most used information sources, the health care professionals, were not cited as most helpful (Table 1 and Table 3). Health care professionals, however, were ranked second in helpfulness (<a href="#luker">Luker <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>, <a href="#schapira">Schapira <em>et al.</em> 1999</a>) along with medical pamphlets (Table 3) (<a href="#luker">Luker <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>, <a href="#raupach">Raupach and Hiller 2002</a>). Medical pamphlets were, also, like health care professionals, among highly-used information sources (Table 1). Among health care professionals, those found to be helpful by patients were the radiation oncologist, the nurse, the urologist, the hospital consultant, and the general practitioner, but no one type of health care professional was cited as helpful in more than one study leading to uncertainty as to which health care professional is viewed as the most helpful.</p>

<p>Nearly 68% of the patients in the Carlsson (<a href="#carlsson">2000</a>) study con0ered books to be the most important <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>for information and 32% of patients in the Schapira <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#schapira">1999</a>) study, who had <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>used books for information, gave these sources the highest rating of helpfulness (4.4 on a scale of 5). Patients who con0ered the health care professional and pamphlets also to be  useful ranged from 42% to 69%. About 48% of the patients in the Schapira <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#schapira">1999</a>) study, who <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>reported to have received information from the radiation oncologist, rated these professionals the second most helpful (4.3 on a scale of 5).</p>

<h3>Influence of patient <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>on use of information sources</h3>

<p>The systematic review indicates that age may play a role in the use of information sources. Younger patients consulted health care professionals and forms of written materials more than older patients did. Table 4 shows the age groups of patients studied by the three researchers who explored the effect of age on sources patients chose for information.</p>

<p>The three studies conducted by Carlsson (<a href="#carlsson">2000</a>), Mills and <span>Davidson</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#mills">2002</a>), and Turk-Charles <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#turk-charles">1997</a>) point to somewhat different results, but when taken together they support the above <span>conclusion</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> Carlsson's (<a href="#carlsson">2000</a>) study, which <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>only written sources, found that younger patients used newspapers and narratives more than older patients did. Mills and <span>Davidson</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#mills">2002</a>) report that younger patients used health care professionals and written sources more. These sources were only part of many other sources that they found younger patients to use more. According to them, younger patients also used other mass media sources, such as television, radio, and the Internet, and interpersonal sources <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of the medical establishment, and most importantly, family and friends and support groups more than older patients did. They go on to say that use by older patients, as their age increased, that is, those in the over-65 group, <span>actually</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> made poor use of not only written information sources but also television, radio, and support groups.</p>

In a different approach, in which they separated non-medical establishment information seeking (using newspapers, television, and friends) from medical establishment information seeking (using physicians and nurses), they found that there was no difference, between younger and older patients, in use of non-medical information sources&mdash;newspapers, television, and friends&mdash; (<a href="#turk-charles">Turk-Charles <em>et al.</em> 1997</a>). That is not to say that Turk-Charles and colleagues contradict use of all written sources by younger patients found by the others. Their approach is different, and they did not study written sources available within the medical establishment.</p>

<p>Education and sex were explored in only one study for the impact that they may have on information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use (Table 4).

Thus, the relationship between <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and sex and use of information sources calls for more research.</p>

<h3>Influence of patient situations on use of information sources</h3>

<p>Among patient situations deemed relevant to this systematic review, only 'time elapsed since a patient was diagnosed with cancer' was examined for its effect on information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use and in only one study. According to the researchers in this study, the use of the surgeon, the cancer specialist, the breast care nurse, the peer support programme volunteer, books, brochures, and friends decreased with increasing time since diagnosis (Table 5) which spanned different treatment stages and post-treatment (<a href="#raupach">Raupach and Hiller 2002</a>).

<h2>Discussion and Conclusions</h2>

<p>Cancer patients consulted health care professionals, medical pamphlets, and family and friends most often for information. The use of health care professionals and written materials from the medical establishment was <span>expected</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> Most striking, is the reliance on family and friends as information sources for information, not just for support. It shows that family and friends are instrumental in the process of managing a complex disease when the patient's ability to comprehend all the information they receive may be impaired due to the stress of illness. </p>

<p>Interestingly, patients were not using the Internet and support groups for information as much as the other sources. The Internet, as an information resource, has existed since the early nineties, and the Web since the mid-nineties, and the support groups are important sources that can be instrumental in coping. It is possible that use of the Internet among elderly cancer patients has increased since the studies cited in this systematic review were conducted. Alternatively, it could be that these elderly patients need assistance using the Internet because it has been developed after the active periods of their lives. Mills and <span>Davidson</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#mills">2002</a>) report that cancer patients rated the Internet as a high <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>source for information. Not all information on the Internet is of high <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> and it is a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>where the user must be more critical than when consulting many other sources.</p>

<p>Cancer patients found books, health professionals, and medical pamphlets to be the most helpful. The results do not tell us which particular books or specific health professionals are the most helpful to cancer patients. Information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use was found to vary among cancer patients only in relation to age; that is, younger patients were found to use health care professionals and certain forms (not always specified) of written materials more than older patients did. Time as an influence on <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>was dealt with in one study which showed that use of mass-media and interpersonal sources mainly within health care decreased over time.</p>

<p>In addition to the results presented above, this systematic review reveals that many questions of information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use by cancer patients either remain unanswered or <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>more research. An analysis of reasons behind the low use of the Internet and support groups&mdash;if the low use of the Internet still exists&mdash;can assist in increasing the awareness of these sources among patients. An in-depth <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis of the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of the most helpful sources can provide guidance in improving information provision. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of the specific written sources that are not used as much, and again, the reasons for less than <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use of both health care professionals and these written information sources by older patients, can be valuable in assisting older patients in making better use of these important sources. Also, an understanding of which sources patients use as time progresses during illness can provide guidance in selecting a channel for reaching patients after they leave the health care <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>As noted, some areas were found either to be completely neglected or barely analysed in the literature. How  patient's <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of information sources is affected by other situations, such as stage of illness at diagnosis, role preferred in decision-making regarding illness, and type of treatment being received <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>probing. Also, the types of information cancer patients need or seek and the information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>they use for a particular type of information <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis to guide <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of information sources based on patient needs. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>better understanding of these areas of information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>use can assist in developing successful interventions the better to inform cancer patients.</p>.

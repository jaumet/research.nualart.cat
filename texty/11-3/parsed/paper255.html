<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The electronic open access journal as a <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>emerged in the mid-1990s, enabled by the rapid development of the Internet. Open access means that scientific publications are made totally freely available on the Web, without any access restrictions. The open access movement was based on a realisation that the traditional subscription-based publishing model unnecessarily restricts access to research results, in a field which <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>is a public good. Most of the early open access journals were <span>founded</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>by single academics or groups of academics at a time when traditional subscription-based journals were still published on paper only. Thus, open access journals not only <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>availability of the articles, they also pioneered the use of the electronic <span>medium</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>Since those early days the whole scholarly publishing field has changed dramatically. Almost all <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>journals are also available in an electronic format, often <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>as <em>big package deals</em>, bundling huge numbers of titles from a single publisher. New, professionally managed, open access publishers (for exampel, BioMedCentral and Public Library of Science) have also entered the market, which finance their operations through author payments. Many big scientific publishers are experimenting with single open access journals or a <span>hybrid</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>form called <em>open choice</em>. Open <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>gives authors the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of having their papers made openly available in exchange for payment of a basic fee. At the same time there are many advocates of open access who believe that scholars should continue to <span>publish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>their articles in traditional subscription-based journals but should at the same time upload open access copies of the papers to subject-based or institutional e-print repositories (<a href="#Harnadetal2004">Harnad <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>). This alternative <span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of open access is often <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to as the <em>green route</em> as <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to the <em>gold route</em> of the journals themselves being open access. Currently, perhaps 4% of scholarly journal titles and 1-2% of articles are <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>published as open access, whereas it is estimated that some 10-20% or all scientific articles can be found openly in full text on the Web in some version, mostly as copies in e-print repositories or on the home pages of the authors (<a  href="#Harnadetal2004">Harnad et al. 2004</a>).</p>

<p>Having outlined the broad picture of the development of open access over the last ten years, this case study concentrates on the <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>experience of <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>up and running of the <em>Electronic Journal of Information Technology in Construction</em> (ITcon). The journal is now more than ten years old and is representative of the type of open access journal which is managed without a formal budget, employed staff and author payments, in the same spirit as many of the open <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>software projects. In addition to reporting on the hands-on experiences, the development of a benchmarking method for scientific journals, and its application to the case of ITcon is also reported. It is hoped that the sharing of experiences of this type of publishing could be of assistance for others in the process of initiating or running similar journals.</p>

<h3>Description of the research field</h3>

<p>The study of the application of information and communication technology in construction (architecture and civil engineering) is a relatively young field, with community-forming events going back to the 1970s and the first dedicated peer-reviewed journals to the mid-1980s. Researchers study areas such as the computer-aided <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of buildings, project management using IT-tools, <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of IT to logistics etc. Currently, there are <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>peer-reviewed journals specialising in the subject, two of which are open access, two society-published, subscription-based journals and three that are <span>purely</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>commercial. In 2004 these journals published 235 articles. Since the average acceptance rate is in the order of 40-50% this means that there about 500 submissions.  In addition to publishing in these specialised journals, scholars in this field can also <span>publish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in construction management journals and in <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>science and IT-specific journals. Since the technology develops rapidly, the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>is by nature such that it is important to get research results out quickly. Also, some of the papers could potentially <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>many readers from among practicing architects and civil engineers, if they were <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>available. </p>

<h3>Basic facts about ITcon</h3>

<p>ITcon has from the start been managed by a group of four editors, two of whom have carried the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>work burden and are the co-authors of this paper. The editor-in-chief (and first author of this paper) has led the work with the journal, negotiated with editors of guest issues and has managed a substantial part of incoming manuscripts through the review process. One co-editor (and co-author of this paper) has had, in particular, responsibility for creating the Web platform on which the journal operates. The Web site has from the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>re0ed on the <span>servers</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of his department. The other two co-editors have taken part in policy-setting <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and have also managed a share of the submissions. </p>

<p>Initially <em>ITcon</em> got a grant of some 30,000 Euros from the Swedish Council of Building Research. This helped in some promotional activities, such as printing paper versions of the first four year's <span>volumes</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> used for <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>promotional <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>at conferences etc. The journal could have been <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>also without this grant, since the time input by the editors and the computing costs are seen as an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>part of academic work and are absorbed by their <span>universities</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The number of papers published by <em>ITcon</em> over the years is shown in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>1.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p255fig1.jpg" alt="<span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>1" width="550" height="386" border="0" /></div>
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 1: Number of papers published by the <em>ITcon</em> journal over the past 
10 years. Individually submitted papers are shown in blue, special issues in yellow</strong></div>
  
<p>As can be seen from the <span>figure</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> the first five years of the journal were rather difficult in terms of attracting enough good submissions. The editors rather naively assumed that a good service and wide readership would promote the journal.  They underestimated the fierce competition for the manuscripts in this area as well as the high priority that academics place on publishing in journals that are <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>on the shortlist of their academic or funding agency's evaluation committees or indexed by institutions such as the ISI.</p>

<p>The decision to also start publishing special issues, which was triggered by a proposal from one of the editorial board members in 2001, <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to be a turning point, as clearly seen in the publication statistics. First, our experience is that it is easier to get potential authors to submit to special issues than as individual submissions. They value the better <span>exposure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that they get in a special issue and perhaps also the clearer publication schedule and promise of more specialised reviewers. Guest editors of special issue also have good networks which help in attracting submissions. Secondly, publishing in the form of special issues relieves the editors of some of the burden of assigning and managing reviews. Finally, based on the publication <span>figures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of 2005, the increased <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of papers that <em>ITcon</em> published also generated a greater interest in <span>spontaneous</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>submissions. However, part of the <span>rise</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in 2005 can also be explained by the merger with the <em>International Journal of IT in Architecture, Engineering and Construction</em> (IT-AEC). </p>

<p><em>IT-AEC</em> was a <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>journal of <em>ITcon</em> that started publishing in traditional format in 1999 but could never <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>a strong enough subscription base that would guarantee its survival. The two journals merged in 2005 adopting <em>ITcon</em>'s open access publication model that had <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to be more resilient. </p>

<p><em>ITcon</em> now seems to have stabilised on publishing around twenty-five papers per year, which is equivalent to a <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>quarterly scholarly journal. This can be compared to a study of open access journals (<a href="#Hedlund2004">Hedlund <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>) which indicated that the average number of articles
published yearly in open access journals was twenty and the median sixteen. </p>

<p>In our experience this number of papers is the upper <span>limit</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of what can be sustained using the current management and operation <span>mode</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> The total amount of working time that the editors and the editorial assistance devote to the journal is around six to eight months a year. To this should be <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>the time spent by guest editors and reviewers. If the <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of submissions was to increase significantly from the current level of around fifty a year, this would put too much strain on the editorial team. Either some paid work <span>force</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>would be needed, the active team would need to be enlarged, or some form of rotation of editors would need to be <span>established</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> In our field author payments are not a realistic option.</p>

<h2>Strategic choices made by <em>ITcon</em></h2>

<p>The Web has made possible new ways of organizing the review process; for instance, where manuscripts are published immediately and structured feedback from readers is used as a peer review, which, after a <span>period</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> promotes the better articles to <em>peer reviewed</em> <span>status</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> An example of such a journal is the <em>Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence</em> (<a href="#Sandewall">Sandewall 1997</a>). In the case of <em>ITcon</em> we decided to adopt a traditional blind, peer-review process. Because of the relatively small size of the research <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> double-blind review was not chosen, since masking the authors would often be very difficult. </p>

<p>In the planning stage there was a discussion whether the journal should adopt a more hypermedia-like layout in order to take advantage of the possibilities <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>by the Web. In the end we opted for a traditional look, so that a paper that is printed out looks <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>like any normal journal paper. This has also made the processing of the articles easier, in particular after we dropped the HTML-version, which was used in the first few years. This decision was based on a clear trend showing that practically each user who had a look at the <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>version of a paper also downloaded the PDF version but not vice versa. We believe that the readers were using PDF as the preferred format for printing, for the local archiving of the paper and for potential re-distribution of the paper to their colleagues or <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>One of the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>reasons for making rather conservative decisions regarding the review process, publication format and content itself was that, by conforming to existing conventions, it would be more likely that the journal would acquire comparable prestige and <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>competing</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> print journals. This policy, however, did not stop the journal from accepting rich multimedia content and <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>as appendices and, since the costs of <span>storage</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>are negligible, <em>ITcon</em> never made any limitations on the size of the articles or number of graphical elements.</p>

<p>We chose not to <span>publish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>issues, since we <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>one of the greatest advantages of electronic-only publishing was the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of publishing an article without any delay once it was ready. In hindsight it appears that the decision was correct since it has reduced the publication delay to the absolute minimum. Also, it could be claimed that the periodical e-mail messages we send to registered readers (more than 800 at present) form <em>virtual</em> issues, since we try to send them four to five times a year, rather than for each published
paper.</p>

<h3>Evolution of the publication platform</h3>

<p>The evolution of the <em>ITcon</em>'s technical platform <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>well the general evolution of providing content for the world wide Web. Since its inception in the early 1990s the Web was <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that it would allow anyone to <span>publish</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> bypassing the few professional publication channels and get their ideas out on the open. However, the early Web, made up of httpd <span>servers</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>code fell short of this promise. It was far from trivial to set up a Web server, create <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>pages and save them to proper folders on the server so that they could be read by the users on the internet. But at the time of <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>up the first <em>ITcon</em> <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in 1995/96 not much else was available.</p>

<p>The first generation <em>ITcon</em> pages were made with a text editor (e.g., <span>Microsoft</span>' <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>s Notepad, the <a href="http://thomer.com/vi/vi.html" target="_blank">Vi editor</a>, or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" target="_blank">Emacs</a>) and saved on the Web server. The papers were written in Word, converted to RTF, the RTF was then converted to <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>with a <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>tool, then the <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>was post processed by a script created specially for <em>ITcon</em>. The script made sure that the formatting was consistent, <span>checked</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>the internal citations and made hyperlinks to <span>figures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and references. The author of the script was also its sole user and due to a small number of papers published at the time, the <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>was also continuously updated. The technical part of the publishing had to be made by a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>very knowledgeable in the technical <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of http, <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and scripting <span>languages</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> Here too <em>ITcon</em> was quite conservative, typically asking users to have not the latest but a generation or two old Web browsers. Tables, for example, were <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>into the <em>ITcon</em> layout in 1997.</p>

 <div align="center"> <br /><strong>Figure 2: First generation <em>ITcon</em> page.</strong></div>
 <br />
 
<p>The second generation of <em>ITcon</em> came with the departure from Notepad and Vi and the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of the use of Web site editing suites such as <span>Microsoft</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>FrontPage and Macromedia Dreamweaver. These packages allowed users to create not only single Web pages but whole Web sites using a <span>visual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>editor and an interface similar to that of a word processor. After the <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>templates are generated, the work of <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>up pages could in principle be left to secretarial staff. It was still helpful, however, for the <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>setting up pages, to have some knowledge of <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and understanding of <span>servers</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> so an ideal profile for doing the technical tasks in <em>ITcon</em> would be a graduate level student with a <span>solid</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>background in Web technologies. At about this time the <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>version was dropped, because Word and the RTF that it was creating was less and less compatible with the RTF conversion tool and the <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>scripts. The in-built <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>output of Word was impractical to use, because the resulting <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>was polluted with formatting rather than the structural tags. The victim of the dropping of the <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>version and the script that created it was the strict, <span>computational</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>checking of the references and their integrity. This has been left to the human interpretation.</p>

<p>In 2002 the two organizations that were at the core of publishing <em>ITcon</em> and a handful of other partners were awarded an <a href="http://www.scix.net/" target="_blank">EU project called SciX
</a>. The project dealt with various issues related to open access. One of the results of this project was the SciX Open Publishing Platform (SOPS), which provides support for organizing conferences and publishing proceedings, various archives and also journals. At the core of the platform is a content management system that uses a database to store the information and scripts to display the information to the users. The system is initially set up by an IT expert but afterwards all publishing activities are made through a Web interface. Setting up papers, changing pages etc. becomes as easy as filling in a form. Most of day-day technical tasks for running the journal can now be entrusted to
a secretarial staff.</p>

<p>Since 2003 <em>ITcon</em> is increasingly using this system, not only to <span>publish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>papers but also to manage the workflow of submissions, reviewing and revising the manuscripts.</p>

<h2>Two studies of <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of academics and the <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of <em>ITcon</em></h2>

<p>At two stages we have tried to make systematic studies which help us in defining the strategy for <em>ITcon</em> as well as provide results that have a value in themselves. In 2000 we conducted a Web <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>with researchers in our <span>domain</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> to which 236 construction IT researchers responded (<a href="#BCBZT2000">Bj&ouml;rk and Turk 2000</a>). At that time these researchers already downloaded around 50% of all the material they read from the Web. </p>

<p>In the <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of the listed construction IT and general IT journals, <em>ITcon</em> shared second place in the answers to the question which journals the researchers <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>most (a non-construction-specific IT journal ranked highest). This confirmed that we had a readership on a par with the best <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>journals in our field.</p>

<p>The study also provided more robust evidence that researchers as readers heartily welcome Open Access journals but that they are reluctant to submit their best work to them, due to career advancement aspects. This we were already learning the hard way. Later studies have more or less confirmed this <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#">Swan and Brown 2002</a>, <a href="#Rowlands">Rowlands <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>).</p>

<p>In 2005 we carried out a benchmarking exercise, comparing <em>ITcon</em> with some of its competitors concerning <span>qualities</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>such as publishing delay, acceptance rate etc. The benchmarking methodology itself is more fully explained in a forthcoming article (<a href="#BCBJH2006">Bj&ouml;rk and Holmstr&ouml;m 2006</a>) and the more <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>results concerning <em>ITcon</em> have been reported earlier (<a href="#itcon2005">Bj&ouml;rk <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>).</p>

<p>Journals traditionally tend to be benchmarked only concerning prestige and using more objective methods <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>citation counting. We wanted also to bring out into the open factors such as publishing delay (from submission to publication), average acceptance rate, and number of readers. These are factors that authors would find very useful when deciding where to submit, but which seldom are publicly available. </p>

<p>One of the factors we could measure for all the <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>construction IT journals (of which all except one claim to be international) was the regional spread of authorship. This could be done through a rather tedious summation from author affiliations posted with the articles. The analysis revealed that <em>ITcon</em> had perhaps the most globally balanced <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of all the journals, with a clear leadership concerning North European authors. We also studied the compositions of the editorial boards of the journals, and found <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>overlap, with three of the journals, including <em>ITcon</em>, forming a clear cluster (IT-AEC, merged with <em>ITcon</em> in 2005 would have <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>part of the cluster).</p>

<p>Shortening the publishing delay was from the start one of the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>motivations for <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>an open access journal. The average delay of <em>ITcon</em> over its history has been 6.7 months, and this compares very favourably with the two other journal we were able to make calculations for (18.0 and 18.9 respectively). As a <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>Raney (<a href="#Raney">1998</a>) reported a 21.8 month delay for the <em>Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing</em>.</p>

<p>The overall acceptance rate of <em>ITcon</em> was 55%. We were able to get published statistics for one of the other construction IT journals (47%) and also for the most highly ranked construction management journal in our 2000 study (51%). These <span>figures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>can be compared with some recent <span>figures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>according to which the average acceptance rate for the subscription-based journals published by members of the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers was 42% (<a  href="#Kaufman">Kaufman-Wills Group 2005</a>). The average for DOAJ-indexed open access journals was 55%, if one excludes two large biomedical open access publishers (ISP and BioMed Central).</p> 

<p>It is very difficult to get <span>figures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>on readership. Journal paper circulation was in the old days a <span>reasonable</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>proxy, and the number of institutional and private subscriptions could give good hints. However, these are <span>figures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that publishers are reluctant to reveal for low-circulation journals (which most construction journals are), because they could make potential authors hesitate to submit their papers. </p>

<p>Of course, the best way of comparing readership would be to make a broad <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of researchers in the field, but this could be a study in its own right. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>way around the dilemma is to measure the relative subscription prices (institutional electronic subscriptions) for the different journals. The differences were quite staggering, a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>from <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to thirty-three Euros an article. There are only insignificant <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>differences between the journals, in fact the lowest priced one has the highest impact factor of the three that are indexed by the ISI. The conclusions we draw is that the higher the price, the lower the number of subscribers and hence readership, are
likely to be. </p>

<p>For the particular case of <em>ITcon</em> it was possible to get quite <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>figures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>based on our Web-server log files.This <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to be a non-trivial task. Since <em>ITcon</em> is a totally freely accessible Website that does not ask for user <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and passwords, it is not possible to get the <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>data that a subscription-based system could provide. Also, the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of this username and password barrier makes it quite hard to make a distinction between Web robots and genuine human users. Our experience would seem to <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that gross Web access statistics are very unreliable as indicators of real readership and greatly overestimate the number of readers. </p>

<p>We have found out that <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>log analysis <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>like Analog removes only about a <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of the robot accesses. The reason, we believe, is that, in addition to well known robots like Google, Yahoo! or Inktomi, there are also a number of local or domain-specific robots. These are not generally known and may also not behave as politely as the big ones. They had to be removed manually so that (1) all clients that reported a 'bot' as a user agent or their IP number or Web address is well known to be that of a robot were removed, (2) all clients that made a request to robots.txt were removed, (3) all clients that made a request to a robot trap <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to capture robots in SOPS were removed, (4) all requests that were just comparing their cached version with the version on our Website were removed. The latter also removed users <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>an article again or <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>an article from the same workstation.</p>

<p>The resulting statistics were discussed by the authors in a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>paper (<a href="#itcon2005">Bj&ouml;rk <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>). On average the journal delivers some 12,000 pages on a weekday and 7,500 on a weekend. The largest drivers of its traffic are the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>engines Google and Yahoo!. </p>

<h2>Conference papers on the Web</h2>

<p>In addition to journal articles, researchers in our <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>publish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>even more conference papers. According to our study of construction IT researchers, they <span>publish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>on the average 1.6 journal articles and 2.6 conference papers per year (<a href="#BCBZT2000">Bj&ouml;rk and Turk 2000</a>). Looking at it from a information management <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> getting access to these conference papers can be even more difficult than retrieving journal papers. Often, the conference proceedings are published by <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and the after-sales are minimal. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>researcher <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to an interesting conference paper often has great <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in retrieving it, unless he himself or a colleague next door who attended the conference has a copy of the paper proceedings on his bookshelf.</p>

<p>In order to do something about the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>some of the key <em>ITcon</em> team, together with other colleagues managed to get funding from the EU for an R&amp;D project (SciX) which had as <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>aim the <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>up a subject-based, e-print repository for construction IT papers (<a  href="#Martens">Martens <em>et al.</em> 2003</a>). This repository, <a href="http://itc.scix.net/" target="_blank">ITC Digital Library
</a>, which has been built on the same <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>platform as <em>ITcon</em>, is now functional and currently contains a little over 1000 papers. Some of the older papers have been scanned in from paper proceedings.</p>

<p>Setting up a self-sustainable process of continuously filling the repository with content, after the initial bulk input which could be done within the SciX project, was one of the aims of the project. In this respect the repository has not fully <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>its aims. The key reason for this has been the reluctance of a number of key conference organizers to allow the Open access posting of their proceedings, even after a delay, in the repository. This is for a number of reasons, such as smoothly running partnerships with commercial publishers, fear of losing membership and paying conference attendees if papers were made freely available, or copyright restrictions imposed by the professional societies under which sponsorship the conferences are organized. Thus, currently, the database contains all the papers of one <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>conference series since 1989 as well as the papers of a minor conference. Additionally there are individually uploaded papers but, on the whole, too few researchers upload their own papers on their own initiative. The lessons to be learnt from this is that strategic partnerships with conference organizers, marketing, and initial critical mass are <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to building a sustainable repository of this kind. </p>

<p>Currently the interest in publishing conference proceedings openly on the Web is on the <span>rise</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and ready <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>such as the ITC repository could <span>prove</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>very valuable as technical platforms.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Open access journals that operate using an open-source-like <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>model (where the costs are absorbed by the <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of the editors and other staff) can be successful, but only under quite restrictive border conditions. The <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>is thus partly the same as in the case of open <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>software projects, which seem to work well in areas which catch the interest of very skilled programmers and not at all in other areas. The type of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>model that <em>ITcon</em> uses works well for journals with a low to <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>number of submissions and published papers, and where the demands like copy-editing, graphical <span>art</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>work etc., which would necessitate paid workers, are not too stringent. It also works well for journals published in other <span>languages</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>than <span>English</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> which have <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in obtaining scattered paying subscribers abroad, and journals published in developing nations.</p>

<p>On the more technical level our experience is that readers are fully content with the PDF versions of papers that look like ordinary papers. One of the reasons might be that due to the rapid change-over from paper issues to electronic licenses also for subscription journals they are getting used to printouts as the standard <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>mode</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Open access journals as a whole have often been criticised for low standards of reviewing, low numbers of published papers etc. One way to answer such critiques would be to be more open about certain <span>parameters</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of our journals. This could for instance be done by publicly posting data about publications delays, acceptance rates, real Web downloads etc. on the journal Web sites. An indexing service such as the <a href="http://www.doaj.org/" target="_blank">Directory of Open Access Journals</a> could also start collecting and publishing standard measures, which would enable more comprehensive benchmarking. And perhaps some <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>certification <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>for peer-reviewed open access journals, which, among other things, would <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>openness about key <span>parameters</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> could be envisaged. </p>

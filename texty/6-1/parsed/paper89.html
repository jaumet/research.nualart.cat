<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Internet information resources are fast seeping into the common consciousness of academia, <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>their place along0e traditional academic resources in core research assignments. Instructors at all course levels incorporate the Internet through such techniques as posting course syllabi and readings on the Web, using interactive course <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>packages such as WebCT and FirstClass, and using communication <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>like chat <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and Web bulletin boards. The eagerness with which many instructors approach integrating Web research <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and technology into their courses provides a significant opportunity for collaboration with librarians. While many instructors are new to Internet searching and evaluation techniques, the library profession has already devoted significant time in investigating the pitfalls of Internet searching, and the nature of information found on the Web.</p>

<p>Librarians' expertise in the world of information can only go so far, however: &quot;it is the <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>faculty who <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>provide the incentive 
(assignments) for <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to use the skills of gathering, evaluating, and 
integrating information into their <span>writing</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot; (<a href="#ref1">Gauss &amp; King, 1998</a>) When <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>have a definite task at hand, the relevance of library instruction becomes readily apparent. Often, however, librarians only find out about assignments once <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>have started to arrive at the Reference desk with questions. The goal of this paper is to provide a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for librarians to interact with instructors, and prepare for three common types of research assignments which necessitate the incorporation of Internet research and evaluation skills.</p>

<p>We will first summarize some of the <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>pitfalls of Internet searching, 
and show how they relate to our three types of assignments. Next, we will describe some of the key points to communicate to both instructors and <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>about each type of assignment. Finally, we will provide <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>assignments, as <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for building collaborative efforts between course instructors and the library. The goal of these assignments is to show <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and instructors alike some basic tips for effectively exploring the Internet and evaluating Web sites.</p>

<h2>The Big Picture</h2>

<p>The use of Internet sites as sources for research is just a small part of the greater information literacy model. Often, we find that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and even faculty are facing this whole new ideology of information without the appropriate <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to discern facts from fictions. Without publishers and editors as filters, Web information can be served up quickly and often with an apparently validating beauty, with tabloids appearing on equal ground with encyclopedias. &quot;Don't believe everything you read&quot; has never rung truer. Though we will not attempt to tackle <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for the wide-spread need for information literacy, it is hoped that this <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for creating guides and assignments for college-level library and <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>paper assignments will serve as an <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and faculty alike to some of these concepts. The <span>explanations</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and examples included in this paper can be used as either pieces or modules of a broader library instruction programme, or as stand-alone assignments <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>around particular <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or curricula. </p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>Library literature includes much on the problems of using the Internet for academic research (<a href="#ref1">Cornell, 1999</a>; <a href="#ref1">Janes, 1999</a>) and the fallibility of current <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engine technology (<a href="#ref1">Notess, 2000</a>), as well as the importance of building strong librarian/instructor relationships (<a href="#ref1">Kotter, 1999</a>; <a href="#ref1">Stebelman, 1999</a>). Based on the issues addressed in the literature, as well as our own experiences with real library Internet-based assignments, our goal is to examine these <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>problems, and <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by way of <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>hands-on assignments that librarians and instructors can either use immediately, or <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>modify to suit their own particular needs.
</p>
 
	<p>Our approach to designing these assignments centered on defining appropriate goals - for both librarians, instructors, and <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>- for <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Internet research skills.  For librarians, the goals are three-fold: increase patron knowledge of how to retrieve and <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>information from Web sites, build a bridge to the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>faculty to make them aware of how the library can help raise the level of their <span>classes</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> critical thinking skills, and encourage participation on their part in developing Information Literacy.</p>

	<p>For instructors the goal we had in mind was to devise assignments that covered basic Internet research skills, yet provided flexibility in terms of the classroom assignments they might need to teach these skills.  Lastly, for <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the assignments needed to be easy to understand, and immediately relevant to <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>papers or other projects that their instructors were regularly assigning.
</p>

<h2>Common Internet Pitfalls</h2>

<p>The basic <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with using &quot;The Internet&quot; as a research tool are well 
known, and <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>roughly into two categories: defects and inconsistencies in the 
searching <span>tools</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and the complexity of interpreting and evaluating results. 
Well-constructed assignments will also address the <span>universal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that 
&quot;students and teachers need to recognize the current limitations of information 
found on the Internet.&quot; (<a href="#ref1">Schrock, 1999</a>) The first step towards building good Internet related assignments is to recognize relevant pitfalls in searching and evaluation.</p>

<h2>Pitfalls of Searching</h2>
<ul>
  <li><i>Students do not know where to start.</i> The first step to <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>a web 
  page is deciding how to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the web itself. Students often do not know the 
  difference between a directory (like Yahoo), a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engine (like Infoseek), 
  or a meta-search engine (like Dogpile).<i>
  
  <li><i>Search engines do not <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the whole web. </i>Once <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>have found a 
  <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>tool they like, they often do not realize that it only covers a small 
  portion of the whole Web, which may be different from other <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or 
  directories. Many studies have been done on the percentage of the web covered 
  by individual <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines and group <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines, and most show that less 
  than 50% of the web is covered by all of these <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>put together. (e.g., <a href="#ref1">Feldman, 1999</a>)</li> 
  
  <li><i>Users do not know how (or care how) to use an individual <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engine's 
  full searching syntax.</i> This problem is also common to OPAC and article 
  database searching patterns, where <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>either do not use <span>Boolean</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>
  operators, or do not understand their proper use. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>study of over 18,000 Excite 
  users performing over 50,000 searches showed that <span>Boolean</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Operators were used 
  in only 8% of <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>statements</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and +/- operators in only 7%. (<a href="#ref1">Jansen <i>et al.</i>, 1998</a>)</li> 
  
  <li><i>Search engines return irrelevant and multitudinous results.</i> Especially 
  for multi-keyword searches, the different ways <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>rank results often 
  means that the most scholarly or assignment-appropriate hits will not be 
  displayed first. Jansen's study also showed that 80% of users only looked at 
  the first two pages of results. (<a href="#ref1">Jansen <i>et al.</i>, 1998</a>)</li>  
  
  <li><i>Spam.</i> Many tricky or innovative (depending on your perspective) 
  Webmasters have discovered ways to spam <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines, loading their pages 
  with keywords in META tags or elsewhere so that their pages are returned for 
  searches totally irrelevant to the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>content of the site.</li></ul>

<h2>Pitfalls of Evaluation</h2>

<ul>
  <li><i>Authority</i>. Many pages do not have an author listed, or if one is 
  listed, there are no credentials or affiliations given to <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>whether the 
  <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is an expert, a journalist, or just an ordinary <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with a casual interest in the Enlightenment. </li>
  
  <li><i>Depth</i>. Internet sites often only provide an overview of a subject, 
  without the expanse of research found in academic journal articles or books.</li> 
  
  <li><i>Bias</i>. Many sites are often constructed with a specific agenda, and may 
  not attempt to present an objective assessment of their subject.</li> 
  
  <li><i>Currency</i>. Students often <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that because information is on the 
  <span>computer</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> it is the most current information available. For research topics 
  where currency is required, it is important to be aware of when a site was 
  mounted, and whether it has been updated since. </li>
  
  <li><i>Sources</i>. While some sites <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>references and have citations just like 
  scholarly books and articles, most provide information without mentioning its 
  <span>origin</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> </li>
  
  <li><i>Stability</i>. Web sites seem to disappear almost as fast as they appear.</li> 
  
  <li><i>Look and Feel</i>. Grammar and spelling errors, little ease of navigation, 
  broken <span>links</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> etc. all contribute to the probable <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of dependability of the 
  site.</li> 
  
  <li><i>Audience</i>. Often, Web pages will be targeted at a specific constituency 
  that might affect the writer's bias, the level of depth with which the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>
  is pursued, etc. Sites utilized as sources for academic papers should be 
  written at the appropriate level of scholarship required of all other sources 
  for the class and assignments. </li>
  </ul>

<h2>Defining the <span>Types</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of Assignments</h2>

<p>By <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>stock of Internet-related assignments that we regularly encounter 
in our library and the ones we have located from other institutions, we have 
grouped the assignments into three types. The Type I assignment involves basic 
Web searching skills. The Type II usually handles retrieval of information from 
pre-selected Internet sites. The Type III assignment is the one that we are all 
<span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>towards and hoping for: a complete <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of electronic information 
(including Web sources) into the standard <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>assignment.</p>
 
<p>These three often <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the various levels of instructor Internet knowledge, 
and/or a difference in educational goals. Also, because student levels of 
technology and information literacy vary between <span>schools</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> libraries may see more 
of the introductory Type I and II, than Type III assignments. In the past year, we have seen significant increase in the Net-awareness of our incoming <span>classes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> usually reflecting their increased access to technology in the high <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>setting. Because of this, we expect to see many more of the integrated Type III assignments in the near <span>future</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h4>Type I - Searching for Sites</h4>

<p><a href="#TypeI">Type I assignments</a> are usually <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to introduce <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to searching on the Internet. They often ask <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to use the Web, find 
a site on a <span>topic</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and report back on how they found it. These assignments <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>
on web-searching skills, and tend toward an attitude of welcoming the Web as a 
<span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>source of information - perhaps advocating the idea of flea-market shopping: 
&quot;It's all there, you just have to find it!&quot; These assignments may include 
<span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to a few <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines and directories - though often there is not 
much distinction made between the two. With inexperienced <span>classes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> it is important to provide specific guidelines or worksheets to illustrate good <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> rather than just turning <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>loose and hoping for the best. We shall <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>how to encourage instructors along these <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the next section.</p>

<h4>Type II - Searching Sites for Information</h4>

<p>For <a href="#TypeII">Type II assignments</a>, faculty will often prepare a course-related <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of Web sites for their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to use to answer questions, or they may instruct them to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>a specific one for information - i.e., &quot;Visit the www.irs.gov and find information on the new <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>tax credits for <span>families</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot;</p>

<p>This second assignment goes a little further in depth. The instructor is 
aware of some of the <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>good information on the Internet, 
and <span>limits</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to certain sites, often resulting in the equivalent of a &quot;library scavenger hunt&quot; with these pages. Though this type of assignment can be good for introducing <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the concepts of site evaluation and what academic Web sites should look like, often it is little more than a lesson in navigating a page and sifting through information for answers, much as one would do with a traditional journal article handed out in class.</p>

<h4>Type III - Researching and Incorporating Internet Information</h4>

<p><a href="#TypeIII">This assignment</a> addresses what <span>Gauss</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and King call &quot;all three stages of true information literacy: gathering, evaluating, and integrating information.&quot; (<a href="#ref1">Gauss &amp; King, 1998</a>) Students are asked to first <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for sources for their <span>topic</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> often as part of a traditional <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>paper assignment, and then (often) evaluate the sources that they find. In the <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of allowed sources, electronic information and Web sites are permitted. This instructor realizes the value of electronic information, perhaps even uses e-journals in their own publications, and so desires to allow and encourage his or her <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to do the same. In the best cases, this is a good assignment, and something that we as forward-looking librarians would want to encourage. However, this is perhaps the most difficult one for the <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> with the pitfalls of both searching and evaluation to be concerned about.</p>

<h2>Developing Communication with Instructors</h2>

<p>If an instructor comes to you with one of these assignment types, and some of the before mentioned pitfalls are evident, how best can you guide them to surer footing? Some of the answers regarding collaboration with instructors are the same regardless of whether we are working with an Internet related piece or another traditional library assignment. Here we <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>common types of questions to ask instructors, and possible <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for improvement of their Internet-related assignments. </p>

<h4>Type I Assignment Guides</h4>

<p>For the individual giving an assignment like Type I, find out the state of their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>knowledge of the technology. Do they have a purpose in encouraging a &quot;free-grazing&quot; type of approach to the Web? If they are just introducing the technology, assist them in preparing a hand-out to point out the basic differences between <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines and directories. You also might give them some statistics regarding the percentage of the Web that is covered by any given <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engine (see <a href="http://www.searchenginewatch.com/">Search Engine Watch</a>) You also can attempt to get them to include a short evaluation form in their assignment. (See <a href="#TypeI">Examples of Type I assignments</a>.) This will encourage preliminary critical thinking in their <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> relationship with these Internet materials. </p>

<p>Ask the instructor if s/he plans to introduce the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the library's electronic resources that are not open to the general public - i.e., the article databases, or electronic journals. Do not cloud the assignment too much by expecting that the instructor will <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in-depth with either of these areas of evaluation or electronic resources. This is an entry-level assignment and one that many of our college freshmen would have no trouble with. However, the evaluation portion can get them thinking along relevant <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in advance of their need for electronic sources for a paper or project.</p>

<h4>Type II Assignment Guides</h4>

<p>For the second type of assignment, the instructor has done some independent research to prepare the material for their class. Again, make sure you know what the instructor wants to accomplish. Here you might <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that he or she adds some questions to their &quot;scavenger hunt&quot; that are more than simple regurgitation of information. </p>

<p>If the sites they are <span>limiting</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to for the assignment are well 
known government or <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>sites, <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>some other non-official sites to 
use for comparative exercises. This assignment is also very useful for comparing 
<span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and fee Internet resources, such as article databases to which libraries subscribe. Encourage the instructor to have his or her <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>locate a piece of information that looks questionable, or identify a discrepancy in information between two sites.</p>

<h4>Type III Assignment Guides</h4>

<p>The Type III assignment presents the most challenges. Here, we often find the 
instructor has either <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>too stringently, or has given no guidance and assumed the ability and knowledge of their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>includes all areas of site appropriateness and evaluation.</p>

<p>Take a look at the instructor's guidelines for the paper. Has he or she provided <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of acceptable sources? Are they <span>limiting</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to on-line scholarly journals? Government and <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>sites? This is a fairly quick way to weed out disreputable sites, but it does not hit all of them, and it <span>limits</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>from using other sources that might be very appropriate. Ultimately, it is up to the instructor to decide what they will and will not accept for <span>valid</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>sources in a paper or project. Careful diplomacy may be needed at times to make a point, or to <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that is out of the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of allowed information types.</p>

<p>For example, one assignment we have seen allows the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to use Internet sources for their papers as long as they have also been published in traditional print form. This kind of restriction avoids a basic analysis and evaluation of Internet 
resources. Although this is usually a safe strategy from the point of view of the dependability of sources, the instructor unknowingly robs <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of a wealth of information that is <i>only</i> published on the Web - electronic journal, <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> government, or otherwise.  Come to them with some examples of helpful sites in their subject area. If you are successful in getting them to allow original Internet sources, then give them a simple evaluation packet to pass on to their <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> such as the <a href="#WSheet">Term Paper Worksheet</a> included in our <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>assignments. Encourage them to edit it as they see fit, emphasizing what they find useful.</p>

<p>For the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>paper assignment with no <span>limits</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>regarding Internet resources, it 
is important to encourage the instructor to at least have a discussion with 
<span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>about the different types of information that they can access on the 
Web. Ask the instructor what types of Internet sources they will accept for the 
paper. Your library might provide a suggested handout or two, or perhaps a Web 
site that you have prepared with examples of scholarly journals your <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>pays 
for, <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>journals on the Web and educational, government and non-profit 
organization sites. Also include some personal sites that may be of interest - 
but point out the possible <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of trustworthiness. If you have the time, 
personalizing it to the subject area of the class will be the most helpful. 
Depending on the number of <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that you handle per year, even preparing a 
<span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>set of examples for the sciences and humanities will be valuable.</p>
 
<p>Lastly, make sure that both the instructor and the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>understand the 
difference in citation format for Internet resources. Many still cite electronic 
copies of traditionally printed journals as if they were citing the paper 
journal itself. Others do the same with on-line journals. Make it easy for them 
by giving them the sites for the <a href="http://www.mla.org/style/sources.htm">MLA 
</a> and <a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/webref.html">APA 
</a> specifications.</p>

<h2>Damage Control</h2>

<p>Often librarians do not have the opportunity to catch a &quot;bad&quot; Internet 
assignment before a student walks in with it in the middle of the semester. This 
results in another special function of librarians - damage control experts! The 
best way to meet these challenges is by some careful preparation. Here are some 
simple steps to aid you in your task.</p>

<h4>1. Be prepared. </h4>

<p>In the same way that you will be prepared to <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>assignments with 
instructors before the semester begins, prepare for the surprise assignments. 
Create a general web <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engine overview page for the Type I assignment. 
Have evaluation handouts printed out for assignment <span>Types</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>II and III. Mount a 
Web site for the Type III assignment suggesting ways to access scholarly 
material on the Web. </p>

<p>Additionally, prepare a more in-depth Internet Research Web-based tutorial to which you can refer any <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> For example, this <a href="http://www.library.uiuc.edu/rex/instruction/Internet/internetresearch.htm">University of Illinois site</a> includes basic a basic <span>introduction</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and then goes into more <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>material, suggesting <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and covering evaluation and citation in detail. As with anything on the subject of the Internet, the page can become dated rather quickly, so frequent updating is <span>essential</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> You will know best how to meet the needs of your student population - being prepared for the one assignment type that you see the most will save a lot of time down the road</p>

<h4>2. Recognize Assignment Types:</h4>

<p>As with most assignments encountered at the Reference Desk, a proper <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of questioning is the best starting point for analyzing assignments that may involve Internet resources. Perhaps an Internet related assignment will be very obvious - for Type I or II, this will most likely be the case. But paper assignments requiring Web sites can be more difficult to recognize. Often it  will not be readily apparent whether the student will be allowed to use Internet resources in their work. Even if they are at the Reference desk to find a traditional <span>source</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> be sure to ask to see a copy of their assignment. If the assignment utilizes or welcomes the Internet sources, check to see if the student has been given any evaluation or <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>from their instructor. Once you decide if it is a Type I, II or III (or a mixture) you will know what <span>sorts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of handouts and assistance are most appropriate to give the patron.</p>

<h4>3. Provide Patron Assistance:</h4>

<p>Chances are, the patrons will be at your Reference desk looking for help on 
another part of the assignment. As you assist them with <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the pertinent 
resources, particularly with <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>papers, be prepared to offer assistance for 
the Internet portion of their research. Make sure to communicate the value of 
electronic resources that the library subscribes to, emphasizing that <i>only 
</i>your <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>affiliates are permitted to use them. Show them your library's Web site evaluation sheet and <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>some of the pitfalls that we have mentioned in this 
article. Refer them to the helps that are appropriate for their type of 
assignment. After you have assisted them in <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>good <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> reputable 
sources, encourage them to refer their fellow <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the Reference desk for 
help with the Internet resources. Even if you are unable to <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the whole 
class, the assistance that you give the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that come into the library will 
go a long way. Remember: satisfied patrons are our best publicity!</p>

<h4>4. Make Instructor Contact:</h4>

<p>If it is early in the time-line of the assignment, attempt to contact the 
instructor. See if you can visit the class or <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>resources to them as a 
group. This <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is the same as one you would use for any unwieldy library 
related assignment that shows up at your door. If it is <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the semester, 
find out who the instructor is and contact them prior to the following semester 
with handouts, web helps, and general suggestions for improving the resource 
gathering experience of their <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<h4>5. Make Staff Contact:</h4>

<p>As with any unexpected library assignment, communicate with other staff. Make 
sure that no one is left to redo the work that you have just done by letting 
others know what type of assignment you have encountered, and what the needs are 
for the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that will be coming in to your library. Let other librarians 
know what "damage control" you have already taken, so that when they meet 
up with the same assignment, they are prepared to do the same.</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The use of Internet resources in the academic <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is only going to 
grow, as developments like <a href="javascript:openWindow('http://www.internet2.edu/')">Internet-2</a>,  
<a href="javascript:openWindow('http://www.ngi.gov/')">Next Generation Internet</a>,
and higher speed access for both homes and libraries make 
information dissemination faster and easier (see <a href="#ref1">Johnson, 2000</a>; <a href="#ref1">McLoughlin, 1999</a>; <a href="#ref1">Preston, 1999</a>; <a href="#ref1">Sheehan 1999</a>). Anticipation and preparation are 
the key elements for any collaborative efforts between librarians and course 
instructors. Hopefully these suggestions will enable you to prepare your own 
assignments (and addendum to instructors' assignments) with relative ease. With 
effective and relevant hands-on Internet assignments in hand, a library can have 
a package to present to departments and instructors to complement their own 
instruction missions.</p>

<h1>Appendix - Example Assignments</h1>

<h4>A Proviso</h4>
<p>The operating principle in the following assignments is that introductions to 
the Internet <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>need simple, clear instructions, not an in-depth 
&quot;library speak&quot; analysis of information skills. With this in mind, the 
assignments presented below use a "bare bones" approach, providing <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with 
basic instruction for getting started with searching and evaluating Internet 
resources, without overwhelming them with the accumulated knowledge of the field 
of librarianship.</p>

<h2><a name="TypeI"></a>Type I Assignment (A)</h2>
<p></p>
<p><b>"Introduction to Internet Searching"</b></p>
<p><b>Goal</b> - To learn how to use various <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to research a <span>topic</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and 
discern the differences in the results they return.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Step 1 - Choose Your Topic</b></p>
<p>Choose a current events related <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for. Possible topics include 
cloning, gun control, satanic cults, Serbia, alternative medicine, etc. Write 
your <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>here: ______________________________________________________</p>

<p><b>Step 2 - Searching</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Using what you <span>wrote</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in Step 1 as your <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>terms, try your <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in three

(<b><i>Google</i></b>), and a meta-search engine (<b><i>Metacrawler</i></b>). Find two sites that look appropriate to you from each tool and write down their URLs (the 
address written in the "Location" bar near the top of your browser) and a brief 
<span>description</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>Type I Assignment (B)</h2>
<p></p>
<p><b>"Difference in Searching Tools"</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Goal:</b> To understand the differences in electronic research <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and the 
types of material they retrieve.</p>

<p>In order to best undertake your research in the <span>future</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> it is important to 
understand what types of electronic resources you have access to and what they 
can do for you. </p>

<p>There are two basic types of <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the Web: the Search Engine and 
the Web Directory. There are also Electronic Databases that you have access to 
as a University student (in other words, the general public can get to the first 
two <span>tools</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> but not this last one.) Some of these databases will link you to the 
full text of a journal article while others will only give you information about 
the author and title of the article.</p>

<p>Using the <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of these three types of resources, choose one from each. As 
you browse the site, try to answer the following questions (hint: try some 
searches in each tool to get a feel for how they work, then visit their help or 
general information <span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to find out behind the scenes information.): 
<br>
<i>(Instructor: insert three lists of the <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>you prefer them to choose from)</i>
<p></p> 
<p>1. What is one difference between Search Engines and a Web Directories?</p>
<p>2. Is there a reason why I would choose to use one over the other?</p>
<p>3. When might it be helpful for me to use an Electronic Database as a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>
tool?</p>
<p>4. How could I get something that I had written into a Search Engine?</p>
<p>5. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Web directory?</p>
<p>6. An Electronic Database?</p>
<p>7. What does this tell me about the reputability of the information in these 
tools?</p>
<p>8. In your opinion, is it easy to find good information for a research paper 
using these tools? Which one would you use first? </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Extra Credit</b> 
<p></p>
<p>Find out from one of the librarians how much it costs the University a year 
to subscribe to the Electronic database that you used!</p>

<h2><a name="TypeII"></a>Type II Assignment (A)</h2>
<p></p>
<p><b>"The Internet Assignment"</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Goal:</b> To understand the basic principles for evaluating Web sites and 
determining their appropriateness for academic research, and their relation to 
traditional print resources.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Step 1</b> - Choose a <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>related to the history of France/Gaul in the time 
of the Roman Empire. Write your <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>here: ___________________________________</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Step 2</b> - Research your site using the <u>Internet Public Library</u> and 
a full-text library database, <b><i>SearchBank</i></b> (linked off of the library's 
home page). Choose one site from the Internet Public Library and one article 
from SearchBank and answer the following questions about each of them:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
  <li>Who is the work's author? Where is the author listed? What credentials are 
  given for the author? 
  <li>When was the work written? 
  <li>Are there references or citations in the work? Give examples, if possible. 
  <li>Is there a bias to the author's writing? 
  <li>Which work did you like better? Why?</li></ol>
  
<hr align=center width=500 color="maroon">


<h2>Type II Assignment (B)</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Page Comparisons</h3>
<p><b>Goal:</b> To compare assignment site with other sites on the Web.
<p>Now that you have finished working on the assignment using the pages that 
your instructor prepared for you ahead of time, use a Search Engine to find more 
Web sites on your <span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
 
<p>1. Use a Search Engine or Directory and locate three Web sites that <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>
your subject area.</p> 
<p>List them here:__________________________________<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_______________________________________<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_______________________________________<br></p>
<p>2. What kind of sites did you find? (i.e. .edu, .com, etc.) 
<p>3. Do any of the sites address the same issues that your assignment sites 
did? 
<p>4. Do they <span>agree</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the information? 
<p>5. Make a case to your instructor for including or not including one of your 
new sites in their assignment next time around. Use the following <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of 
con0erations as appropriate. 

<h3>Web Site Evaluation Suggestions</h3>

<p><b>A. Author</b>- Who <span>wrote</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the page? Can you tell? Is it easy to see if they 
are affiliated with a <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>institution? Does this make him/her qualified to 
write on the subject? Is there contact information for the author (e-mail as 
well as <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>mailing address)? <br>
<p><b>B. Publisher</b>- In the print world, the publisher's name can be an 
indication of the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information provided. Most people would be more 
willing to believe information in a book published by a university press than 
information found in a supermarket tabloid. In the Web world, the web server is 
the equivalent to a publisher. The web server's <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>can help in assessing the 
reliability of the information. Here are a few of them: <br><i>.edu</i> an 
educational or research institution <br><i>.com</i> a commercial enterprise, 
including companies, newspapers, commercial Internet Service Providers 
<br><i>.gov</i> a governmental body <br><i>.mil</i> a military body 
<br><i>.org</i> a not-for-profit organization<br>
<p><b>C. Intended Audience</b> - Is it apparent who the page was created for? 
For students? For scientists? For consumers? How might this affect the level 
and/or reliability of the information?<br>
<p><b>D. Background Sources</b>- Does the author cite any other material? Do 
they give full references for it? Would you have any way of checking to see if 
the things that they cite are indeed real articles or books?<br>
<p><b>E. Currency</b> - When was this page put up on the Web? Has it been 
updated since? Is the information current enough for your needs on this 
topic?<br>
<p><b>F. Accuracy</b> - Are there any <span>grammatical</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> spelling, or typographical 
errors? If there are, there may be problems with the dependability of the 
content of the page as well.

  of coverage, any <b>bias</b> you can <span>detect</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and the <b>audience</b> the site 
  was written for.</li></ul>
<p><i>Paper hint:</i> For your own sake, due to the rapid turnover of 
information on the Internet, you may want to print out and keep a copy of the 
Web information that you cite in your paper. Even good information can 
disappear due to problems with <span>servers</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or movement from one server to another.

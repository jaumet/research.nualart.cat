<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The epigraph indicates the value which has been historically attached to subtlety of <span>distinctions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>in the language or lexicon of information retrieval <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>  In this respect, the passage anticipates the principle formulated in <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span><span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of indexing and <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>that the value of an index <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>lies in its discriminatory power.  In this principle, and in its historical anticipation, there is a strong, although largely unnoticed, contrast with the <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of information retrieval research, particularly <span>experimental</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>information retrieval research, that the <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of an information retrieval system is to be <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>by its capacity to deliver relevant records in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>to deliberately articulated queries.</p>

<p>The <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>here is not, then, with the uses of <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>in information retrieval but with the broader question of whether the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>principle embodied in the practice and theory of <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and indexing can yield more satisfying <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and evaluative criteria for information retrieval <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>than those which have been characteristically assumed in information retrieval research.  Two <span>paradigms</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>have been <span>distinguished</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>in information retrieval research, the <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and the physical, but they share the <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of the value of delivering relevant records (<a href="#ref">Ellis 1996</a>: 19; <a href="#ref">Belkin and Vickery 1985</a>: 114).  For the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of the discussion here, they can be con0ered as a single, if heterogeneous, paradigm, linked if not united, by this common <span>assumption</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The contrasting paradigm implicitly embodied in <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and indexing may finally be incommensurable with that of information retrieval research, with disputes not logically resolvable within either paradigm.  The approach taken in this paper will be suggest: </p>


<ul>
<li>that an alternative principle <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>discriminatory power has been <span>held</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> implicitly and explicitly, in a number of largely <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>discourses;</li>
<li>that the cumulative effect of recognising this is to <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>more viable and productive criteria for designing, using and evaluating information retrieval systems;</li>
<li>and, finally, that the classical tradition of information retrieval research can itself be assimilated to the new model.</li>
</ul>


<p>In this final respect, the development proposed here is an exemplar of scientific development in which discarded <span>paradigms</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>are absorbed into developing ones, as special cases.</p>


<p>The discourses in which an alternative principle for the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and evaluation of information retrieval <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>can be discovered and which are to be covered here are:</p>


<ul>
<li>an emerging, although rather isolated and discontinuous, <span>strand</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of information retrieval research;</li>
<li>accepted <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of the principles of <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and indexing;</li>
<li>Giambattista Vico’s critique of Aristotelian principles and categories for classification;</li>
<li>and, most crucially, ordinary language discussion of information <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span></li>
</ul>


<p>The paper will review information retrieval research, <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>the liberty of conflating distinguishable aspects for the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of a higher level discussion, and then <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>that an alternative principle for evaluation can be found in the discourses identified.  The value of the alternative model developed will be explored.  In <span>conclusion</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> it will be suggested that the alternative principle and criteria developed can have liberating effect, allowing theory and practice to interact, and that a productive transformation of the field has been indicated.</p>

<h2>Alternative paradigms</h2>
<h3>Information retrieval research</h3>
 
<p>Information retrieval research, particularly in the <span>experimental</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>tradition emerging in the 1950s in Britain and North America, has taken as its founding <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>the principle that an ideal information system should deliver all (and possibly only all) the records relevant to a given information need.  In order to evaluate information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>in relation to this desired end, or variations on it, various steps were taken: relevance was stabilised and quantified, sometimes being reduced to a binary or dichotomous variable; and measures of precision and recall, which <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>on the prior stabilisation of relevance, were developed.  More recent research has questioned the validity of aspects of this paradigm, although more <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>with <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>to its sub0iary concepts (relevance and information need) and derived measures (precision and recall) than with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>to its founding <span>assumption</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The adequacy of the concept of relevance employed information retrieval research has been questioned.  <span>Experiments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>substitute a measurable <span>phenomenon</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> relevance as constructed under artificial conditions, for an unmeasurable one, relevance under operational conditions, but fail to demonstrate that there is an adequate correlation between the two.  Most disturbingly, it has been suggested that operational relevance is fluid, <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>by intention, context, and other <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>seen or read, and simply not amenable to stabilisation or, further, quantification (<a href="#ref">Ellis 1984; 1996</a>).</p>

<p>The classical measures of precision and recall are also rendered increasingly artificial by the high <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of interactivity enabled by recent information technology developments.  How, when searching a <span>CD-ROM</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>database, is the final set of records to be isolated except by a process whose very arbitrariness invalidates it as a component of a measure of system performance? (<a href="#ref">Warner, 1992</a>)  High interactivity, and unmediated searching, also reduce the need for a query to be fully articulated in advance of searching.  There has also been a realisation that a deliberately stated query (which can be <span>distinguished</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>from an information need or assertion of relevance) may be a methodological requirement for <span>controlled</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span><span>experiment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> but is not <span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>to the information seeking <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#ref">Heine, 1977</a>) and that it is possible to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>without verbalising an information need.</p>

<p>The classic information retrieval paradigm, and the concepts and measures associated with it, could be preserved but only at the cost of increasing its distance from more realistic information seeking situations.  It may be that not only are the classical concepts and measures both becoming and being recognised as increasingly artificial but that the founding <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>- that a system should deliver all (and only all) the relevant records should be re-examined.  What is required, then, is not questioning of concepts with the paradigm but of its founding <span>assumption</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> turning what has been received as a given into an object of enquiry.</p>

<p>To some extent, this has begun to <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>within information retrieval research.  The subtlety and complexity of information retrieval has been recognised (Swanson 1988).  Most specifically, the principle of exploratory capability, the ability to explore and make discriminations between <span>representations</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of objects, has been suggested as the fundamental <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>principle for information retrieval <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#ref">Ellis 1984; 1996</a>).</p>

<p>On a subjective level, this can be <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>by introspection: that what I desire from an information retrieval <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>is not a possibly mysterious transformation of a query into a set of records, but a means of enlarging my capacity for informed <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>between the <span>representation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of objects within the given <span>universe</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of discourse.  Such an enhanced capacity for informed <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>broadly corresponds to exploratory capability.  It could also be regarded as analogous to a sense of <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>control over, or ability to discriminate between, <span>representations</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of objects.</p>

<p>One example (which may be fictional in a double sense) can be given of the need for enhanced discriminatory power.  At one point in time, a researcher might wish to <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>the private individual, Samuel Langhorne Clemens, from the author, Mark Twain, (perhaps out of interest in his copyright disputes or in his brother’s, Orion Clemens, activities as Secretary to Nevada Territory).  What would be valuable for this purpose would be a system which did not conflate these two distinguishable aspects of the individual but enabled them to be <span>differentiated</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>  At a later point in time, the same researcher might be interested in information on Mark Twain and Samuel Clemens con0ered as single <span>entity</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>  An information retrieval system should then be able to differentiate and to link together the occurrences of these different <span>names</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> as required.</p>

<p>In <span>conclusion</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> the <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>that it is desirable to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>all, and possibly only all, the records relevant to a given query can be rejected in favour of the alternative principle of exploratory capability or enhanced capacity for informed <span>choice</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>  Introspection <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>the value of exploratory capability.  Its appeal as an alternative to the <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>information retrieval paradigm could be strengthened if it could be found, even if only implicitly or in analogous forms, in other, <span>independently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>developed, discourses.</p>

<h3>Principle of indexing and classification</h3>

<p>An acknowledged principle of indexing and <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>is that the value of a <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>is its discriminatory power.  By discriminatory power is <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>the ability to partition and select from the objects <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>within the given <span>universe</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of discourse.  What particular terms or methods of <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>are appropriate will vary with the area of discourse and the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of interest: most obviously, a factor which differentiates one set of objects from another will not serve to discriminate within either set of objects.  Discriminatory power is again analogous to exploratory capability, or, more accurately, a critical factor in enabling progressive and <span>controlled</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>exploration.</p>

<h3>Vico’s critique of Aristotelian classification</h3>

<p>A strong, and highly significant, analogue to exploratory capability can be found in Vico’s critique of Aristotle.  Aristotle’s philosophy, as well as being a <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and indirect <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>understandings of <span>genus</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>species</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> specific difference, synonymy and <span>equivalence</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> involved, in some of its aspects, a systematic method of enquiry in order to classify an object.  An enquirer was required to ask a series of questions: Does the thing exist?  What is it?  How big is it? What is its quality? and the like.  This method of enquiry was subjected to an incisive critique by Vico:</p>

<blockquote>Aristotle's <i>Categories</i> and <i>Topics</i> are completely useless if one wants to find something new in them.  One turns out to be a Llull or Kircher and becomes like a man who knows the alphabet, but cannot arrange the letters to read the great book of nature.  But if these <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>were con0ered the indices and ABC's of inquiries about our problem [of certain knowledge] so that we might have it fully surveyed, nothing would be more fertile for research. (<a href="#ref">Vico 1988</a>: 100-101)</blockquote>

<p>The last clause of that critique deserves <span>emphasis</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> ‘nothing would be more fertile for research.’  The rigidity of the method is avoided, while some of its techniques are retained, and it is transformed into a systematic and effective means for enhancing knowledge of an object.  Analogously, while rejecting the rigid transformation of a query into a set of records assumed as desirable in information retrieval research, similar techniques can be used to explore the <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of discourse covered by the information retrieval system.</p>

<p>A further supporting analogue can be found in the fictional rather than discursive treatment of rigid classifications in Dickens’ <i>Hard Times</i>.  The logical <span>distinctions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>exemplified in Bitzer’s definition of a horse - ‘Quadruped.  Graminivorous. Forty teeth, <span>namely</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>twenty-four grinders, four eye-teeth, and twelve incisive ...  Age known by marks in mouth.’ (Dickens 1989: 6) - which does resemble 19th century taxonomies for the horse, themselves <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>by the Aristotelian method of definition by <span>genus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>species</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> are presented as harsh (<a href="#ref">Warner 1994</a>: 106-108).  Out0e the restricting enclosure of the town, a different metaphor for knowledge is discernible:</p>

<blockquote>They walked on across the fields and down the shady lanes, sometimes getting over a fragment of a fence so rotten that it dropped at a touch of the foot, sometimes passing near a wreck of bricks and beams overgrown with grass, marking the site of deserted works.  They <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>paths and tracks, however slight. (<a href="#ref">Dickens 1989</a>: 353)</blockquote>

<p>The value of an information system could then be the ability it <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>discriminatingly to follow ‘paths and tracks, however slight’.  Classification schemes themselves (and their analogues in thesaural relations among indexing terms) can then be received not as <span>fixed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>models of stable entities but as valuable exploratory <span>devices</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>Ordinary discourse</h3>

<p>Ordinary, particularly informal spoken, discussion of information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>is simultaneously highly significant and difficult to produce as evidence.  Evaluative criteria may be implied rather than explicitly articulated.  Yet when a searcher complains that it is difficult to control the number of records retrieved, a principle of discriminatory power is being invoked.  More explicitly, one spoken <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>to an earlier version of this paper was: ‘that’s the basis [an enhanced capacity for informed choice] on which people use <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>anyway’.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Similarities in themes and principles enunciated or implied have been revealed in largely <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>discourses, emerging in information retrieval research, implied in <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of principles of indexing and <span>classification</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> made explicit in Vico’s critique of Aristotelian methods of <span>investigation</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> and present, in partly unarticulated form, in ordinary discourse.  The <span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>expression</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>varies, but an enhanced capacity for informed <span>choice</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> for effective discrimination, or for <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>control was discovered to be valued in all the discourses adduced.  Independent agreement with an emerging and rather isolated theme in information retrieval research, of exploratory capability, <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>supports for replacing the <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>emphasis on the delivery of relevant records with such a principle for the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and use of information <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>  In some respects, possibly through the influence of concepts of <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and of ordinary discourse understandings, working <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>may offer exploratory capability and productive <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>  In Vico’s terms, <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>understanding has been in advance of theoretical articulation.</p>

<h2>Evaluative model</h2>

<p>Endorsing the principle of enhanced capacity for informed <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>can have a liberating effect, revealing the intra-theoretic nature of many disputes within the classic tradition of information retrieval research: it <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of a deeper understanding of relevance; enables a mutually informing relation between practice and theory; restores man as artificer as a designer and user of information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>rather the cipher of information retrieval research; and can enable the development of more satisfying evaluative criteria.</p>

<p>Disputes over the validity of constructs demanded for retrieval system evaluation in the classic tradition of information retrieval research, for instance whether deliberately contrived relevance judgements are adequately correlative with real world judgements, can now be regarded as intra-theoretic, connected with the theoretical <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>imposed, not <span>inherent</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>in the process of information retrieval and not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>contributing to an understanding of those processes.  In some respects, the construction imposed by the research paradigm may even have inhibited development of understanding of its chosen <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of study.  For instance, the methodological need to reduced relevance to assessments, possibly open to quantification, and stable over time, may have inhibited exploration of its many possible dimensions.  Some dissenting <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>have insisted on its complex and multi-faceted nature (<a href="#ref">Wilson 1973</a>; <a href="#ref">Watson, <i>et al.</i>, 1973</a>).</p>

<p>A mutually informing and productive relation between theory and practice can be developed.  For instance, the <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>experience of those indexing procedures or retrieval <span>algorithms</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>which enhance exploratory capability in specified circumstances can inform theoretical development and system <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and modification.  The divorce of information retrieval research from practice has been noted and sometimes regretted, although less often explained.  Now the <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>understanding embodied in working <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>can be recognised and theoretically developed.</p>

<p>The further question then also arises as to whether accepting the principle of exploratory capability has <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>implications in terms of the indexing procedures or <span>algorithms</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>for searching to be adopted.  An immediate <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>would be that it does not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>have unambiguous <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>implications: That the particular indexing procedures and <span>algorithms</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>to be used will be critically dependent on the purpose and context of retrieval, including the cost of indexing and retrieval.  Crucially for continuity of <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>development, techniques <span>identical</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>with or analogous to those currently developed may be used to different ends.  It should also be noted that the <span>Boolean</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>logic used in many retrieval <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> does, under conditions, have the advantage of relative transparency to the searcher.  The objection that it is an ineffective way of transforming an information need into a set of relevant records is no longer tenable.  It could still be objected that is some <span>applications</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> for instance with heterogeneous textual material without humanly assigned index terms, it gives inadequate control over the <span>representations</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>within the <span>universe</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of discourse.</p>

<p>A deeper effect is to restore man as an artificer and to recognise the subtlety of the processes involved information retrieval.  Rather than being subjected to retrieval process beyond immediate control, the searcher is presented with an enhanced capacity for <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and for making recalled sets.  The new, and historically unprecedented, potential for enhanced forms of knowing of existing textual material can then productively explored.  For instance, the unrivalled opportunity <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>by full text database for exploring the <span>semantic</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>mutability of written word forms with different <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>can be pursued.</p>

<p>More <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>evaluative criteria could be developed from the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>evaluative principle of enhanced <span>choice</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> partly by drawing on the understandings already developed in <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>classification</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>  Yet it should be recognised that quantitative comparative measures are unlikely to result.  Once the diversity of <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>for information retrieval is recognised, the idea of a single, generally applicable approach to system <span>design</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> or a single comparative measure of system <span>performance</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> becomes severely questionable.  The best outcome which can reasonably be <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>from research and from reflection on practice is a better understanding of the process of information retrieval, which can then be used either to <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>better information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>or to maker more effective use of existing <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Replacing the <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>on the delivery of relevant records with a stress on exploratory capability or <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>control as a <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and use principle for information retrieval can have a liberating effect.  It <span>yields</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>more satisfying evaluative criteria while preserving a strong continuity with previous work, particularly in recognising the <span>utility</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of developed information retrieval techniques.  Theory and practice, rather than being <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>or even antagonistic, are enabled to inform each other.  The discourses, of philosophy, <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and ordinary discussion, from which the new principle has been <span>drawn</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> can be brought further to bear upon information retrieval, transforming it into a human science and recognising its subtlety and <span>significance</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>minor, although significant, relief, is liberation from the obligation to read work in the classic information retrieval paradigm, except for the emerging signs of self-questioning.</p>

<p>The transformation advocated in this paper resembles, in some respects, a mathematical <span>revolution</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and can also be seen as an example of scientific progress.  Classically fundamental <span>transformations</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of mathematics have preserved the form while modifying the interpretation (<a href="#ref">Ramsey 1990</a>); analogously, information retrieval techniques have been preserved but adapted to a new end.  More broadly, it has been argued that a <span>discipline</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>exhibits the history of a true science if its earlier stages can be seen as special cases, from the <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of its <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>development (<a href="#ref">Roberts 1982</a>): in this context, the automatic transformation of a query into a set of records can be seen as a possible support for informed <span>choice</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> valuable in certain sets of circumstances.  Rather than, as <a href="#ref">Swanson</a> (1988) indicated, ‘Waiting for Godot [while failing] to grasp what is now within reach’, we can begin to explore the potential for improving human <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>with recorded knowledge.</p>

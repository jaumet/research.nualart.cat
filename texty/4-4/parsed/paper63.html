<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The number of commercial organizations with a World Wide Web presence has increased phenomenally in the last five years. From being an element of the Internet it has now come to dominate and for many people the Web is the Internet.  The <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>is <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to continue for a number of reasons: </p>

<ul>
<li>personal computers are becoming cheaper and more people are using computers in their work place; </li>
<li>in the USA and Europe de-regulation of the telecommunications market is resulting in cheaper phone calls and increased competition; </li>
<li>the telecommunications industry is investing a great <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in infrastructures and in fast fibre optic backbones; </li>
<li>last year AT&amp;T and BT announced a <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>for the creation of a large transatlantic telecommunications and Internet provision service as a result of which it is hoped that the price of long distance calls can be reduced (<i><a href="#refs">Yahoo! Daily News,</i> 1998</a>); </li>
<li>the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of digital television <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>the world is likely to boost access to the World Wide Web and make it more popular, allowing for access through a relatively cheap set-top box (making ownership of a <span>PC</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>not a prerequisite for using the Web); </li>
<li>research by a consultancy agency predicts that cable television will increasingly incorporate the World Wide Web and provide access for many currently under-represented groups, such as women (<a href="#refs">Cane, 1998</a>). </li></ul>


<p>Once a large enough number of people globally have access to the World Wide Web it is con0ered by many analysts that electronic commerce will come of age. </p>

<p>Recently there has been a frenzy of investment in Internet based companies with their flotation on stock markets producing highly-priced shares. <i>Netscape</i> was one of the first companies to make successful debut in the marketplace from small beginnings. <i>Yahoo!</i> and other ‘portal’ sites have been the latest companies to attract big investment, largely because such gateway sites are <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to be strategically placed to attract new users. However,  many of the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>sites, such as <i>Yahoo!</i>, are not making any substantial profits at present, consequently much of the interest in such sites is based on the perceived <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the Web. The confidence displayed by the financial world is clear evidence of the strong belief in the potential of the Web for the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span><span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>One problem encountered when trying to do research on the World Wide Web is that there is a mass of statistics and reports, some of which are contradictory. There is, for example, a significant difference between the statistics from different research firms regarding traffic <span>figures</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> The research firms, in addition, use different methodologies to arrive at their numbers with the result that it is not possible to gauge <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>how much the World Wide Web is being used; this has an effect on how <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>views the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of using the Web, ‘The Association of National Advertisers did a survey… and they said that a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>measurement was the No.1 reason why they didn’t buy on the Internet’ (Stone, 1998). Therefore, more research is needed on some of the basic use made of the World Wide Web and this paper is a part of an ongoing exploration of that issue.</p>

<h2>Aims and Methodology</h2>

<p>This research is part on a continuing <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>which was begun in 1995 (<a href="#refs">Cockburn &amp; Wilson, 1997</a>) and <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in 1996 and 1997 (<a href="#refs">Ng <i>et al.,</i> 1998</a>) into the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>use of the World Wide. The general <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>that continues that work is reported elsewhere (<a href="#refs">Greaves <i>et al.</i>,  in press</a>).</p>

<p>A second aim was to study how a specific <span>industrial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>sector, publishing and bookselling, was using the World Wide Web. Samples were <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>from the bookselling and publishing categories in the <i>Yahoo!</i> directory and a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the sites chosen was conducted. In addition, a questionnaire was sent to the companies. It was hoped that by doing so it would be possible to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>how these industries were using the Web and, by comparing the data with the results from the re-examination of the 1997 sites, to be able to see how similar, or dissimilar, the book trades’ use of the World Wide Web is to other sectors.</p>

<p>The heading ‘publishing’ is broken down into 57 sub-headings, in <i>Yahoo!</i> and included, in mid-1998, 3,336 companies. It was decided to draw a stratified <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> so that the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>would <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>the structure of the population. <i>Yahoo!’s</i> booksellers’ category, on the other hand, is an alphabetical <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of businesses with no structure. As a result, it was decided to draw a <span>purely</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>random <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>for booksellers. This was done with the aid of a <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(written in Qbasic) which gave a set of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>generated random numbers. For each random number, the corresponding bookstore on the <i>Yahoo!</i> <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>was chosen. As a result of these <span>sampling</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>procedures, 270 publishers and 30 booksellers were selected for the <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Some of the companies in the <i>Yahoo!</i> directory, chosen in the <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> could not be located. In this instance, the next site was chosen.</p>

<h2>Creation of a Typology of Business Use of the World Wide Web by Publishers</h2>


<p>In previous studies the sites to be surveyed have been classified using the <span>Standard</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>Industrial Classification, but this Classification is insufficiently fine to categorise booksellers. In addition, the <i>Yahoo!</i> directory does not attempt to breakdown the bookselling category; <span>instead</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>  companies are listed alphabetically. This is <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>because, even though there are specialised bookstores, many, in fact, sell a large variety of books for different customers. In other words, bookselling is a difficult industry to classify. As regards publishers, it was decided to follow the <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in use by the <i>Yahoo!</i> directory, shown in Table 1.</p>

<p>The unclassified section included companies that had not been placed elsewhere. ‘Maps’ and ‘Music’ were linked to other parts of <i>Yahoo!’s</i> overall directory. It was noticed that some companies <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in more than one of the above categories, but without doing a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>on each company, it is not possible to know how many <span>duplicate</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>entries there are.</p>

<h2>Booksellers’ and Publishers’ Sites on the World Wide Web</h2>

<p>Booksellers and publishers often have large sites on the World Wide Web, with a host of services on offer. Generally, booksellers tend to have <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>sites and more <span>features</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> but this <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>on the individual company. The kind of <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>that appear on booksellers and publishers sites include: </p>

<ul>
<li>General company publicity - ranging from <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of intent and goals to factual information such as location of stores with <span>maps</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> contact <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>etc. <span>Sometimes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>there are author profiles and <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>about members of staff.</li>
<li>Alerting services for new titles, author events (such as book signings).</li>
<li>Book exchanges for swapping books and for second-hand books</li>
<li>Chat rooms for customers to engage in <span>discussions</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> Some are for general chat, others for more focussed discussion. These <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>are an attempt to build a book ‘community’. Other <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>include quizzes or competitions. </li>
<li>Order tracking: an interactive service whereby a customer can monitor the progress of an order. This can be a member of the general public, checking to see when he book will arrive, or business-to-business, for example, a bookseller checking on the progress of an order from a wholesaler. </li>
<li>Customer-written reviews of books. <span>Sometimes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>a customer’s own stories are published on the site. </li>
<li>News: from general news to specific book news. Newspapers often have <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>free news coverage on their sites.</li>
<li>On-line ordering. Customers or other businesses can order publications <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>from the Web site. Often, ordering is by a form which can be filled in by the customer, including credit card <span>details</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> Sites often have secure <span>servers</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to ensure the safety of information exchange. More <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>sites have ‘shopping cart’ facilities, allowing a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to order multiple items at once and change items at the last moment. </li>
<li>Searching facilities. Many sites, especially booksellers, have <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>databases on their sites, enabling visitors to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>for publication in a number of different ways, for example, by author, title, or subject. Often the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>can be presented as a natural language query. </li></ul>


<p>Many of the <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>highlighted above are <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>exploit the interactive elements of the Internet and to personalise service. Alerting services seem to be a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>marketing <span>technique</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>employed at booksellers’ and publishers’ sites. Some of these services allow a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to create of profile of interests and, when a new title appears on that <span>topic</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> they will be automatically informed by e-mail. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, sees this as an important development: &quot;In the <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>we’re going to have books <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>readers rather than readers <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>books&quot; (<a href="#refs"><i>Bookseller</i>, 1997</a>). </p>

<p>It is not surprising that the booksellers’ and publishers’ sites that have these <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>can be very expensive to set-up and <span>maintain</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> Edwards calculated that top of the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>site would cost up to £500,000 and a basic <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>engine would cost about £30,000, so clearly significant investment is required to build such sites (Edwards 1997).  This contrasts with the general <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in other work in this series that the <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>cost of development and maintenance of sites is $10,000 or less (<a href="#refs">Cockburn &amp; Wilson, 1997</a>; <a href="#refs">Ng <i>et al.</i>, 1998</a>)</p>

<p>There are no hard and fast rules as to what a booksellers’ or publishers’ site should contain, but <a href="#refs">Edwards</a> (1997) identifies key ingredients for successful sites:</p>


<ul>

<ul>
<li>Something new or unique.</li>
<li>High level of customer service.</li>
<li>Swift and personal e-mail <span>response</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span></li>
<li>High <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>products at <span>reasonable</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>prices.</li>
<li>Excellent product <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and selection/recommendation.</li>
<li>Huge searchable database, <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>by a strong PR message.</li>
<li>Effective promotion on the Internet via newsgroups and so on.</li>
<li>Effective advertising in traditional media, e.g., magazines.</li>
<li>The site should be updated very <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>.</li>
<li>It should offer club-type membership.</li>
<li>It should provide <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to other sites and encourage other to link to it.</li>
<li>The Web pages should be quick to down-load, and compatible with all browsers and <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in common use.</li></ul>
</ul>

<h3>Typology of Use of the World Wide Web by Publishers</h3>

<p>The <i>Yahoo! </i>classification of publishers was used and a stratified <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of companies surveyed was draw from this <span>classification</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>is shown below, with the percentages of companies in each category. </p>

<p>As Table 1 shows, a wide variety of types of publishers is <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in the <i>Yahoo!</i> directory. The <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>was sufficiently large for the <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to be representative of the different types of publishers using the Web for <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span><span>purposes</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> The largest category is the &quot;unclassified section&quot; (21%). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>closer inspection of these sites showed that many of them could have been placed in some of the other categories above, and it is not known why <i>Yahoo!</i> did not do so. The second largest category is &quot;education&quot;, and observations of some of these sites showed that they targeted their sites for different age groups (i.e., infant to adult). People often use the Internet for information gathering and research so therefore, it is likely that educational publishers feel that there is an <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>Internet audience. Surprisingly, given that Cockburn &amp; Wilson (1996), found that <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>companies were constituted the largest category of businesses on the World Wide Web, publishers of <i>computer literature</i> constitute only 2.19% of publishers in the <i>Yahoo!</i> directory. Later work by <a href="#refs">Ng <i>et al.</i></a> (1998) showed that whilst other sectors were catching up <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>related industries were still dominant. </p>



<h3>Publishers’ Use of World Wide Web Sites
</h3>
<p>The same scheme was used to classify the publishers' use of Web sites, as was used in the previous studies. </p>

<div align="CENTER"><img src="p63fig1.gif" width=507 height=328></div>

<div align="CENTER">Figure 1: Publishers’ use of World Wide Web sites</div>

<p>It can be seen from <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>1 that very few publishers are using their sites for supplying only basic information about themselves. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span><span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span><span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(22%) are giving product information but no price information. 23% are giving price information about their products but are not encouraging potential customers to buy on-line. On-line shopping (36%) and e-mail ordering (15%) are much higher percentages than in the general <span>survey</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> carried out in 1997 and 1998. This shows that publishers are using the Web to try to sell products, in spite of suggestions in the trade publication <i>The Bookseller</i> that publishers are wary of selling on-line because they are concerned not to alienate bookstores. The results of this <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>seem to <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>that this is a reducing problem and that publishers are increasingly going into retail. Registration of credit card <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>as a form of selling is not very popular (1%), and sites offering <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>products are rare (1%). </p>

<h3>Publishers’ Use of E-mail</h3>

<p>The same categories for <span>classifying</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>sites were used for publishers as had been used for the general <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#refs">Greaves, <i>et al.</i>, in press</a>), with one addition, the use of e-mail to send catalogues to potential customers. </p>

<div align="CENTER"><img src="p63fig2.gif" width=523 height=300></div>

<div align="CENTER">Figure 2: Publishers’ Use of E-mail</div>

<p>Figure 2 shows how publishers in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>are using e-mail. 9% of the sites had no e-mail, which is a <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>proportion than for the general <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(4.2%), however, whilst studying the sites it became clear that the reason for this was the replacement of traditional e-mail facilities by forms, to be filled in by the site users. Queries that encouraged users to evaluate a company’s Web site were higher at 9% than for the general <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(6.5%). It is possible to speculate that this is the case because publishers, who are clearly involved in more on-line selling than in other sectors, are aware that how much they sell could be determined by the layout of their web site; therefore they are keen to elicit customer’s opinions. Information queries as in the general <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>was the highest category for uses (58%). The chance to order by e-mail was available at 15% of sites, which is roughly the same as in the general <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(14.6%). The ability to order and send credit card <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>by e-mail (3%) is lower than in the general <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(12.6%), this is <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>due to the fact that more companies are engaged in on-line selling through forms which have boxes for credit card <span>details</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> 6% of publishers were using e-mail to send customers a catalogue of their publications and this often occurred at sites that had no <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>facilities. The probable intention is to send the customer a catalogue that they can browse through at their leisure, without having to go on-line. Also, some sites <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to send catalogues by e-mail because <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of all their publications were not available on the Web. </p>

<h3>Publishers’ Use of Multimedia</h3>

<p>&#9;The same <span>classification</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> previously mentioned, for sites’ use of multimedia was used.</p>


<div align="CENTER"><img src="p63fig3.gif" width=404 height=252></div>

<div align="CENTER">Figure 3: Publishers’ Use of Multimedia</div>

<p> &#9;Figure 3 shows the results of the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of use of multimedia on publishers’ sites. The written word does not dominate as the <span>technique</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>for presenting publishers’ sites. Even though most of their products are text based, only 1% of sites use text only. Text and graphics are used by roughly a quarter of sites (26%); sites for comics, on the whole, were <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to have very high <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>graphics, with the use of animated GIFs being popular. By far the largest percentage of companies use a <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of text and graphics and <span>photographs</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(67%). Many were book covers (presumably scanned, and not always of the best quality). Commentators on the publishing industry have always emphasised the importance of book covers to attract customers’ <span>attention</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> Sites using sound and video constituted a small percentage (6%), some publishers use sound for readings from books, and among comic publishers the use of video clips seemed fairly popular. </p>

<h3>Publisher’s Use of Links</h3>

<p>&#9;The use of <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>within publishers’ sites were examined following the same <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>as previously mentioned.</p>

<table align="center" border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=3 width=367>
<tr><th valign="TOP">Type of Link</td><th width="22%" valign="TOP">Number</th>
<th valign="TOP">Percentage</b></th></tr>

</table>


<div align="CENTER">Table 2: Publishers’ Use of Links within World Wide Web Sites</div>

<p>&#9;Links to sites of relevance are higher among the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of publishers (33.7%) than among the general <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of companies (12.7%). Sites of relevance for publishers are other publishers’ sites, but also, sites that <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>with the subject matter concerning the publisher. For instance, a legal publisher may have <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to sites that contain legal information. It can be argued that this is an attempt to provide the most useful service to customers; in other words, the user may view the site, as a good overall informative site (and perhaps be book-marked for this reason). Links to ‘hot’ sites in the publishing <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>were lower (13.3%) than in the general <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(25.4%), this may be because, by selling, most publishers’ sites are engaged in serious commercial activity and fun sites could be seen as being superfluous to their <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>activity. 53% of the sites <span>contained</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>no <span>links</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> virtually the same as in the general <span>survey</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<h3>Other Features of Publishers’ Sites</h3>

<p>&#9;Sites were categorised using the same <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>as in previous studies, with the addition of 3 new elements, which are discussed in the methodology. These were:</p>

<p>&#9;The results of the <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of other <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of publisher’s Web sites can be seen in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>4. About 10% of publishers in the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>use their site for recruitment information. This is significantly lower than the numbers who do the same in the general <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(16.9%). This may be due to the fact that publishers generally employ few people and is a specialised field with their own trade journals being used for recruitment. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>quarter of the sites were engaged in some form of advertising, possibly an indication of the commercial nature of such sites. Nearly a quarter of the sites have searching facilities which is higher than for the general <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(15.8%). This is logical, as publishers’ sites may contain many items and people often want to locate a specific publication, which would be very hard if the stock was <span>represented</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> say, as an alphabetical <span>list</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> The sites without <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>facilities were often those of smaller publishers with a small number of publications. 13% of sites have <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>products or demonstrations (book reviews and extracts were not included as they are not complete products nor complete enough to be labelled demonstrations). The availability of discounts on items sold over the Web was included, as much of the literature suggests that discounting is an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>element of bookselling on the Web. Discounts are perceived as the means by which Web publishers and booksellers can compete with non-Web companies and, moreover, it is often emphasised that a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>advantage of the Internet is that it saves costs, allowing for these savings to be passed on to customers. The interesting result of this <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>is that only 11% of publishers clearly advertise discounts on their stock. Many non-Internet publishers who have adopted the Web are not willing to discount stock in case it affects their high street sales. This low percentage of sites advertising discounts could call into question some of the theories espoused in the literature about the Web allowing cheaper prices for people. 10% of companies in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>provided users with the chance of receiving newsletters or being included on mailing lists. Information for authors varied: some provided submission guidelines or a statement of publishing policy, others <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>pages of advice on how to write, or <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to other sites about general authoring. Other facilities available on sites were things like an e-mail alerting service, telling customers about new items <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to the stock, more <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>versions of such alerting services involved a user creating a personal profile of interests and automatically being mailed when items in those areas became available. </p>

<h2>Booksellers’ Use of World Wide Web Sites</h2>


<p>&#9;Booksellers’ use of sites was classified following the criteria laid out in previous studies</p>

<div align="CENTER"><img src="p63fig5.gif" width=502 height=342></div>
<p align="CENTER"></p>
<div align="CENTER">Figure 5: Booksellers Use of World Wide Web Sites</div>

<p>&#9;The results are shown in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>5. Most noticeable is the very high <span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>for on-line selling: 80% of companies are using the Web to sell books, which is more than double that for publishers (36%) and is much higher than that for the general <span>survey</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> It was <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>that many of the sites used more than just an on-line form for their on-line selling, shopping carts were common, especially on big sites. The second largest category was for e-mail ordering (9%), showing that a combined 89% of the sites surveyed were attempting to use their sites for <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>ordering of items. This supports the claims made in the press that bookselling has <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>itself as an <i>avant-gard</i> Web <span>business</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
<b><i><p>Booksellers’ Use of E-mail</p>
</b></i>
<p>&#9;The same categories were used to classify booksellers use of e-mail, on their sites, as was used for publishers. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div align="center"><img src="p63fig6.gif" width=480 height=307></div>
<p align="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
<div align="CENTER">Figure 6: Booksellers Use of E-mail</div>

<p>&#9;7% of booksellers have no e-mail presence on their site. However, as stated earlier, a number of sites had on-line forms to be filled in by the user. As with the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of publishing sites and the general <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> the majority of uses for e-mail were general information enquiries. Similarly, a protocol seems to be in place whereby the Webmaster should be contacted mainly on technical <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in using the site. 9% of booksellers surveyed are allowing orders to be sent by e-mail but none is allowing credit card <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to be sent by e-mail. At these sites, the on-line selling, whereby an <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>purchase is made, is all done through forms.  </p>

<h3>Booksellers’ Use of Multimedia</h3>

<p>&#9;The same criteria for <span>classifying</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>booksellers’ use of multimedia was employed as for previous studies.</p>

<p>&#9;As with publishers, the vast majority of booksellers’ sites use text and <span>photographs</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(70%), and, as with publishers, many are of book covers. Some sites have readings from books presented as sound files. Text-only sites are very uncommon (4%) and seemed to be those of mainly smaller booksellers with small stocks. </p>

Sites that have no <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>constitute 45%, which is lower than for the same category for publishers and in the general <span>survey</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<h3>Other Features of Booksellers’ Sites</h3>


<p>&#9;Other <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of booksellers’ sites were categorised using the same <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>as was used for publishers.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p63fig8.gif" width=543 height=330></div>
<p align="CENTER"></p>
<div align="center">Figure 8: Booksellers’ Use of Other Features</div>

<p>&#9;Figure 8 shows the results of the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>into other <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>at booksellers’ sites. Search facilities are available on 64% of sites, nearly triple that of publishers. This can <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>be accounted for by the fact that many booksellers have large stocks of books and if each book had a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>Web page, this would make it very time consuming for a customer to find the book he is looking for. Many of the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>engines available at sites were very <span>advanced</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> allowing, for instance, natural language queries. 38% of companies had some form of advertising on their site. Free products or demonstrations were included on 13% of sites, and 9% of sites had information for potential authors. Some sites allow book reviews to be written and submitted by users. 19% of sites were willing to let users sign up for <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>newsletters or mailing services. 35% of sites advertise some form of discounts, compared with 11% of publishers. This clearly shows that discounting strategy plays a part in booksellers’ use of the Web. </p>



<h2>Conclusions</h2> 

<p>&#9;Publishers and booksellers are clearly committed to on-line selling. Interestingly, over a <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of publishers are selling on-line, which calls into question claims that they are unwilling to alienate the middleman (the bookstores) by selling <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to customers. The majority of the booksellers surveyed are actively engaging in on-line selling. As a general observation it was noted that many of these bookstores used shopping carts; publishers, on the other hand, tended to use on-line forms. Only about 15% of both groups’ sites have e-mail ordering. It was <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>that e-mail ordering appears to be increasingly replaced by on-line forms. Likewise, a number of sites are using forms as a way for customers to contact them <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of e-mail. The forms normally consist of standard boxes whereby the user fills in <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(such as his name, e-mail address, and sometimes his postal address). Most of these forms end with a large text box for comments. The use of forms in this way <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>has a number of benefits, in that the organisation is assured of receiving the information they desire (unless the user leaves the box blank), set out in way that may mean the information can be dealt with in an automated way. When a customer fills in an e-mail for an order or an enquiry, it is up to them as to how they present the information, meaning that the e-mail has to be processed by humans. The use of forms is therefore, <span>probably</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> of benefit for companies. </p>

<p>&#9;Many booksellers and publishers are using <span>photographs</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(often of book covers) on their sites, thereby making the site feel more like a real bookstore. Sound and video are only available on a small number of sites (6%). Part of the reason for this could be that plug-ins are often required to view or listen to an extract, and the browser needs to be the most up-to-date.</p>

<p>&#9;Booksellers’ and publishers’ Web sites have other <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>that are interesting. Like other companies they use the Web for recruitment and advertise on their sites. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span><span>extension</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of this is the inclusion of information for potential authors. As in the real world, some publishers stated on their sites that they do not accept unsolicited manuscripts, but others seemed keen to find new writers, and are using the Web for this purpose. Searching facilities are common on the sites and 10% of publishers and 19% of booksellers appear to try and inform customers of new items in stock, through mailing lists or newsletters. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>very interesting <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>is that discounting, although not uncommon, is not practised on the majority of publishers’ and booksellers’ sites. </p>

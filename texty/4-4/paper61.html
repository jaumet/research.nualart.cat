<div>Abstract</div>

<blockquote>Information Technology ('IT') has made a prolific impact,
both in sociological and commercial terms. In the business world, the
pursuit of new technology and working practices has often been at the
expense of equal regard for the correct methods to manage the new
technology. Contemporary IT techniques and methods include Management
Information Systems ('MIS') which are normally implemented on a
company-wide basis. However, MIS implementation has major cultural and
organisational implications which will form the main focus of this paper. A
conceptual model is proposed for successful MIS implementation which
combines established research findings with ethnographically-informed data
from a small, UK-based, business.</blockquote>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Definitions of
culture are widespread and the difficulty in refining down to a single
definition is exacerbated when it is considered that over 150 different
definitions of the term "culture" have been formed [<a href="#ref">Kroeber &amp;
Kluckhohn, 1952</a>]. For the purposes of this paper, the most cited definition
of Culture as being the collective programming of the human mind which
distinguishes members of one group from another [<a href="#ref">Hofstede, 1994a</a>] will be
used. </p> 

<p>Extending the notion of culture into an
organisation leads us to the definition of Organisational Culture which is
the pattern of basic assumptions [<a href="#ref">Schein, 1990</a>] used by individuals and
groups to deal with an organisation's personality and feel. It is this same
organisational culture which defines behaviour, motivates its individuals
and affects the way in which the organisation processes information. </p>

<p>Researchers are generally agreed [<a href="#ref">Schultheis &amp;
Sumner, 1995</a>; <a href="#ref">Sherman, 1985</a>; <a href="#ref">Lucey, 1991</a>] that organisational IT
implementations occur for the following reasons (either individually or in
combination): to improve efficiency, to improve effectiveness and to bring
about transformation. A Management Information System can be defined as an
integrated structure of databases and information embracing all
organisation levels of a company [<a href="#ref">Lucey, 1991</a>] which facilitates the
optimum transfer of information to meet corporate objectives.</p> 

<p>Researchers and authors have analogised organisations to an
iceberg [<a href="#ref">Gibson et al, 1994</a>; <a href="#ref">Gummesson, 1988</a>] which shows only 10-15
percent of its total mass above the surface water [Gummesson, 1988] and is
thus a suitable analogy to show the visible and non-visible facets to an
organisation's culture. This analogy demonstrates the importance of deeper
research in an organisation in order to gain access to the submerged 85-90
percent of the organisation's value and belief system.</p> 

<p>Several factors can combine to form the basis of an
organisation's culture, examples of which include: reports, letters, memos,
emails, health &amp; safety regulations and rulebooks. Some examples of
protocols of a more-verbalised nature include forms of addresses, repeated
stories/myths, "in"-jokes, rumours and speculation. Factors such as
dressing styles/requirements and programmed organisational career paths can
also contribute to an organisation's culture. </p> 

<h2>The justification for a new approach</h2>

<p>Although several established culture-change models exist (<a href="#ref">Hofstede 1994b</a>], <a href="#ref">Lundberg</a> [1985], <a href="#ref">Schein</a> [1985, 1990], <a href="#ref">Dyer</a> [1985], <a href="#ref">Gagliardi</a> [1986] and <a href="#ref">Lewin</a> [1952]), they are often more suitable for some organisations and less suitable for others. A review of the inherent issues involved in these established frameworks demonstrates the different cultural basis that established researchers and practitioners have used. The suitability of these models is generally for circumstances and situations of relevance at the time of their inception. The ideal cultural change model may well be a skilful blend of the most pertinent tools and techniques from the existing range of cultural and organisational change models. </p> 

<p>The proliferation of IT during the 1980s [<a href="#ref">Sherman, 1985</a>] impacted strongly on the perceptions of business managers. Researchers and Authors [<a href="#ref">Hirschheim, 1985</a>; <a href="#ref">Sherman</a>, 1985; <a href="#ref">Noori</a>, 1988] have confirmed that, throughout the 1980s, technically-oriented staff employed by organisations recognised the severe gap in their organisational recommendations and the perceptions and expectations of non-technical managers. </p> 

<p>The cultural gulf between management and IT staff [<a href="#ref">Ward &amp; Peppard, 1995</a>] encompasses the notion of sub-cultures and the traditional IT function has been often regarded as just another department within the evolving organisation. In reality, the culture of the IT department is often specifically geared towards achieving strategic growth through the use of contemporary IT techniques. Conversely, management, privy to (and perhaps governed by) financial constraints, are often content to expand on existing legacy systems which are ill-suited to achieving contemporary corporate goals.</p> 

<p>It is issues such as these
which necessitate a new Organisational Culture-IT framework, a framework
which, although having its foundations in established cultural models,
embodies recent and novel findings. The coterminous constraints of
established theoretical models can be fused with new endemic elements to
produce an exploratory and explanatory conceptualisation of a contemporary
Small Business. In this paper, new data for the new framework contains
significant input and findings from an extended ethnographic case
study.</p> 

<h2>Ethnographically-informed data</h2>

<p>The ethnographic study examines the
organisational culture at Thermo-X, a pseudonym for a Derbyshire-based
owner-managed company. The company employs about 30 people on two sites in
the design, manufacture and calibration of thermocouples, resistance
thermometers and special purpose instruments. The Managing Director ('MD')
is also the owner of the business and has substantively set up the
operational procedures and established systems.</p>

<p>Thermo-X has been involved in a Teaching Company Scheme
('TCS') with Sheffield Hallam University for a three year period. The
primary objectives of the Scheme were to improve manufacturing performance
by the introduction of stock-control software, to introduce manufacturing
resource planning (MRPII) and to improve existing operational procedures
and control. A secondary objective, and an integral part of the primary
aims, was the introduction and demonstration of contemporary IT methods and
techniques.</p> 

<h2>Resistance to Change</h2>

<p>Researchers ranging from <a href="#ref">Earl</a> [1993] to <a href="#ref">Zmud</a>
[1984] agree that organisations attempt to change their culture in order to
bring about a strategic change such as the introduction of a Management
Information System. Confirmed by <a href="#ref">Brown</a> [1995], established culture-change
researchers have put forward several cultural change models with no
framework in clear dominance. </p> 

<p>Due to the numerous and varied definitions of culture, it may be apparent that attempting to
change organisational culture according to one researcher's model may be
significantly easier than using another researcher's framework. The very
diversity of the culture-change models contributes to illustrate their
respective weaknesses in addition to their intended strengths. Given that
the various models have provided great insights into the culture change
process, the highlighted concerns should be explored further. </p> 

<p>A literature review of the culture-change frameworks has
shown that different researchers vary in their preference of a basis for
culture. None of these models or frameworks is necessarily wrong as each
possesses its own advantages and disadvantages and the ideal cultural
change model may well be a skilful blend of the most pertinent tools and
techniques from this range. The ethnographically-informed data has
confirmed that organisational culture change and a successful change
programme possesses several common precepts: the existence of an initial
crisis, the importance of a strong leadership, emphasising the importance
of success and relaying news of the success and the importance of
supporting change. </p> 

<p>Several exercises were carried
out in an effort to change the organisational culture in order to
successfully accommodate the impending IT implementation. The Model
incorporates the various culture-directed activities carried out at
Thermo-X in order to stylise the culture in preparation for the impending
IT overhaul.</p> 

<h2>The MISCO Model: Validation and Common Themes</h2>

<p>Specific issues highlighted from the ethnographic study will now be discussed, including
which techniques are of particular relevance, whether certain facets are be
actioned in a particular order and whether elements are etic or emic in
their applicability to a UK-based SME. The issues highlighted suggest that
the ideal solution cannot be purist or dogmatic in its nature or outlook.
The factors involved are not just characteristic to the disciplines of
Management and Information Technology but are also induced from and
informed by areas as diverse as Psychology, Politics and Sociology.
Recognising that the new approach encroaches on seemingly dissimilar,
non-homogenous, subjects will be an integral part to its acceptance and
subsequent usefulness. </p> 

<p>The MISCO Model was "walked
though" with key personnel at several external organisations in order to
test its suitability to the organisation. Validation revolved around key
questions; the feedback of participants was both constuctive and useful. It
was the purpose of these organisational experiences to support or
contradict the constructs put forward in the MISCO Conceptual Model.
Analysis of the interviews at the four SMEs revealed a commonality of
interests and experience in a number of different areas, the most important
of which will now be discussed. </p> 

<p>All of the
interviewed SMEs, including Thermo-X, carried out an evolutionary IT route,
expanding on legacy systems in order to further company ambitions. Prior to
the implementation of the new MIS, no formalised or recognised IT
Implementation Plan had been used. Hence, duplication of several data
processes and procedures was commonplace (for example, involving Accounts
and Order Processing).</p> 

<p>For all of the interviewed
companies, moving to the new MIS has required the replacement of obsolete
equipment and the subsequent procurement of new hardware, software and
network infrastructure. Management involvement in the definition of new
requirements, both on an historical basis and for the new MIS, has allowed
experienced users to participate in the Requirements Definition phase of
implementation.</p> 

<p>Reliance on legacy systems has often
been indicative of the organisation's culture (a reluctance to replace
ineffective and outdated information systems). Disparate development and
installation of stand-alone software packages in some departments has not
facilitated central co-ordination of IT activities. This individual
technical approach is mirrored by the existence of departmental
"sub-cultures" in all of the visited SMEs (for example, people in a Service
department carrying out procedures in a vastly different manner to people
in a Manufacturing department).</p> 

<p>Provision of proper
IT Training has often had minimalist presence at the SMEs. Interviews have
revealed that even the legacy system were not used to their full potential.
Recognition of this, and emphasising its importance for the new MIS, is a
key element of the MISCO framework. Transfer of data has often been on a
non-standard basis with no reference to Best Practice or recognised IT
procedures. A simple example would be data transfer by disk rather than via
a secure network connection. The risks to data integrity, reliability and
exposure to viruses are all too apparent.</p> 


<h2>MISCO Model: Introduction</h2>

<p>The MISCO (Management Information System
Culture-Organisation) Model comprises a set of activities and techniques to
prepare SME organisations for MIS implementation. MISCO has six main
stages. Stage 1 is recognition, followed by Stage 2 consisting of IT
Training and Education. Stage 3 consists of the following activities: pilot
schemes, communication, education, facilitation, dissemination and
mentoring. The analysis and evaluation stage (Stage 4) incorporates a
feedback loop. Stage 5 breaks down into an acceptance activity leading to
the final stage (Stage 6), stability. This final stage also incorporates a
feedback loop back to Stage 2. A "cause-effect" relationship exists between
activities, where the outputs of an activity become inputs for the next
MISCO activity.</p>  

<h2>MISCO Stages</h2>

<p>MISCO comprises a group process for UK-based SMEs and, in this context, can be regarded as
both a methodology and a process. MISCO can be broken down into six main
stages, some of which can be broken down into several component activities.
All stages consist of several multifarious, yet interrelated,
activities.</p> <p>Identification of the activities within
these six stages, in addition to guidelines, tools and techniques to be
used, is important in the interests of correct understanding and
application. Identifying the personnel involved in all stages will also be
of paramount importance. The activities involved in each of the stages can
be summarised as follows:</p>



<ul><li>Stage 1: Recognition
<li>Stage 2: IT Training and Education
Stage 3: Cultural and Organisational Change
<ul>
<li>Step 1 - PS:&#9;Pilot Schemes
<li>Step 2 - CM:&#9;Communication
<li>Step 3 - ED:&#9;Education
<li>Step 4 - FC:&#9;Facilitation
<li>Step 5 - DS:&#9;Dissemination
<li>Step 6 - MN:&#9;Mentoring</ul> 

<li>Stage 4: Analysis &amp; Evaluation
<li>Stage 5: Acceptance
<li>Stage 6: Stability</ul>


<p>Detailed descriptions of the above activities are
provided in the section titled "MISCO Stages and Activities", together with
a discussion of the personnel involved. A schematic illustrating the MISCO
constructs is provided in Figure 1.</p> 

 <p>From Figure 1, it would appear that the MISCO model is a
relatively simple process. Stages and Activities are linked in an
"input-output" relationship. The relationships can be described as
"input-output" as they are carried out in sequence. The relationships exist
as inputs and outputs of their respective predecessors (ie. an output from
one process or stage becomes an input for another). These same
relationships may or may not be carried out by the same group of
people.</p> 

<p>The schematic, Figure 1, aims to
conceptualise the change process. The aims and objectives of the schematic
are to provide a clear and concise view of the MISCO change process.
Feedback loops are shown where applicable. For example, whilst performing
out the activities in Stage 3, SME members (after evaluation of progress
made) may decide to return to Stage 2. Returning to Stage 2 at this point
indicates ineffective or insufficient progress being made during Stage 3
(Pilot Scheme, Communication, Education, Facilitation, Dissemination and
Mentoring).</p>

<p>Figure 1: MISCO constructs</p>
<p><img align="left" src="p61fig1.jpg"></p>

<p>Emulating established methodologies, such as PRINCE, it
is recommended that the MISCO change process be split into two groups: the
MISCO Support Team (consisting of at least one member, the facilitator) and the
MISCO Management Committee. The MISCO Management Committee is a group of
senior personnel (at the company and perhaps from external support
organisations) who co-ordinate, support and oversee implementation and
progression of the MISCO framework. </p> 

<p>The MISCO
Management Committee is a body set up to control the development of the
MISCO change process. The Committee has representation from various
interested parties (such as company management and academic support).
Typically, the Committee might have senior user representatives in addition
to personnel from other departments (or departmental functions) such as
accounts, purchase, HRM, sales and so on. The Committee should have the
authority to make executive decisions on the MISCO project.</p> 

<p>The MISCO Support Team is a group of personnel whose main
function is to provide members of the SME with technical and organisational
support and advice. The main function of the MISCO Support Team is to
organise, document and carry out the inherent constructs of the MISCO
framework.</p> 


<h2>MISCO Organisational Roles</h2>

<p>As discussed in Section 7.2, the
MISCO change process should be carried out by at least two people, one of
whom assumes the role of the implementor, the other should be a
representative of top-line management.</p> 

<p>The MISCO Support Team should co-ordinate the activities of
the group and should interact with the MISCO Management Committee. Key
responsibilities of the MISCO Support Team (or implementor)
include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Scheduling meetings and ensuring that all necessary resources are available (eg. OHPs, flip-charts).

<ul>
<li>Making contact with organisational (company) members and
ensuring that they are able to take part in the group meetings (either in
person or using an electronic medium such as email).

<li>Organising the documentation generated by group discussion
and, after the meeting is finished, supplying the MISCO Management
Committee with this documentation.</ul>
</ul>

<p>In the MISCO Support Team, the facilitator is
responsible for summarising performance information about the change
process and for highlighting opportunities for improvement. These
responsibilities demand of the facilitator a thorough understanding of
MISCO's criteria, guidelines, tools and techniques. However, the
facilitator should not solely decide on the adoption of specific changes.
This is a prerequisite of the MISCO model as changes and future directions
should be obtained by group consensus.</p> <p>The other
members of the group should provide input, with executive decisions resting
with the facilitator. In smaller organisations, it may be practicable for
one person to play two or three roles, for example group leader,
facilitator, and to provide inputs as a "group member". There is a danger
at this point that objectivity will be lost.</p> 

<h2>MISCO Guidelines</h2>

<p>Apart from the guidelines listed in the previous section,
there are a number of additional guidelines which are relevant to the MISCO
change process on a macro level. Such points are not necessarily associated
with a particular stage or activity but are nevertheless an integral part
of the framework:</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>The stages which the MISCO Support Team
executes should be properly documented. The facilitator should possess full
responsibility for documenting these processes as this historical data may
prove to be of significance either in later stages or activities of the
MISCO change process or in subsequent change programmes.</p>

<h3>Linked Meetings</h3> 

<p>Each meeting should, if possible, link to the
previous meeting. An introduction to the meeting should link the main
themes of the previous meeting (or meetings) with the aims and objectives
of the current meeting. Each meeting should end with a summary of the main
points which have been discussed. This summary can become the basis of the
introduction for the next meeting. Such an approach can be justified in the
interests of group cohesion and focus.</p>

<h3>Group Cohesion</h3>

<p>Group "cohesiveness" (described earlier) is an integral part
of the MISCO model. The facilitator should not use autocratic management
methods to "enforce" such cohesion as this approach is contrary to that
desired in MISCO.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p>The feedback loops shown in the MISCO model should be carried out in good time.
Unduly deferring action (or re-action) endangers cohesiveness and the
overall impetus of the project. Conversely, not waiting for a sufficient
amount of time may infer to the organisation a hurried or superficial
implementation approach. Future research may indicate a desired time for
implementation (or re-implementation).</p>

<h2>MISCO flow chart notation and guidelines</h2>

<p>The MISCO framework
has been conceptualised using flow chart notation, the chief aim of which
was to understand the relationship between the stages and activities. By
doing so, a clear understanding of the MISCO change-process is achieved.
The MISCO flow chart represents processes using ANSI standard flow chart
symbols. MISCO uses only four symbols: the Start/Finish ellipse, the
Activity rectangle, the Decision diamond and the Flow arrows, depicted in
Figure 2.
<p>Figure 2: MISCO Flowchart Notation</p>
<p><img align="left" src="p61fig2.jpg" width=289 height=209></p>
<ul><li>Start/Finish - this symbol signifies the beginning or the end of a process or stage.
Activity - represents an activity or stage of a business process. A brief description of the activity or stage is provided
within this symbol.

<li>Decision point - at the end of certain processes, decisions may have to be made. Progression to the next stage or activity may depend on the outcome to the decision.

<p>The MISCO schematic is accompanied by a full narrative of the depicted stages and
activities. Without this, information and understanding may be lost. Such
information would not be appropriate for inclusion on a schematic but is
invaluable for facilitating understanding of the model.</p> 

<h2>MISCO Stages and Activities</h2>

<p>MISCO involves a number of different stages and activities.
The following section discusses MISCO tools, techniques and guidelines
appropriate for each stage and activity. Stages and activities will be
listed in desired order of execution.</p>

<h3>Stage 1: Recognition</h3>

<p>In this first key activity, the organisation recognises that problems exist and these are
identified. As discussed earlier, the facilitator should lead, motivate and
co-ordinate the activities of the MISCO Support Team. This approach takes
responsibility of problem identification away from the MISCO Management
Committee. However, the Committee should be encouraged to participate fully
in these early stages, as previous knowledge of the organisation's history
and previous organisational or industry experience of Committee members may
be extensive and relevant to these initial discussions. Additionally,
including the views of the MISCO Management Committee broadens MISCO's
impact as it does not then rely on the initiative and experience of a
limited number of managers.</p> 

<p>This initial stage
identifies previous and current organisational problems. Given that most
business processes can almost always be improved, identification in this
first instance refers to both external and internal pressures. Work by
Lundberg [1985] has confirmed that many UK-based SMEs are likely to face a
range of varied external pressures. These pressures, relevant to MIS
implementation, may include such tasks as the replacement of legacy systems
or the need to meet Y2K (Year 2000) compatibility, an important issue at
the time of writing. These pressures may result in the organisation
changing the way its internal processes and procedures are carried out.
Established culture-change authors [<a href="#ref">Lundberg, 1985</a>; <a href="#ref">Schein, 1990</a>; <a href="#ref">Dyer,
1985</a>; <a href="#ref">Gagliardi, 1986</a>; <a href="#ref">Lewin, 1952</a>] agree that these changes almost always
face resistance from staff within the organisation.</p> 

<p>The experiences from Thermo-X and from the external
organisations show that, in addition to identification of external
pressures, identification of sources of discontent within the company
should also be encouraged. It is recognised that these additional problems
can enhance the level of motivation among organisation members. This also
allows group members to have a clear view of what is to be achieved using
MISCO. </p> 

<p>A list of identified pressures and problems
should be internally checked (by the MISCO Support Team) and then submitted
to the MISCO Management Committee for additional verification and
validation. The final version of the list should form the basis of the
MISCO Support Team and the facilitator should assemble the Team by
selecting and inviting prospective group members.</p> 

<p>The list of problems should have a <i>focus</i>. This is
because listing problems which are unrelated or which have an unnecessarily
broad outlook can lead to the identification of several different,
unrelated, avenues for change. The result of this could be reduce the
cohesiveness of the Team and Committee. The approach to problem
identification should attempt to emulate that of "brainstorming". All
participant should be encouraged to suggest problems, no matter how minute
they may appear. No one person's ideas should be ignored or belittled. Once
a list (labelled as the "Feasibility Study" on the schematic) has been
drawn up, work can begin on prioritising this list.</p> 

<p>Internal and external pressures may cause the organisation
to change the way its processes and procedures are carried out. Various
authors [<a href="#ref">Lundberg, 1985</a>; <a href="#ref">Schein, 1990</a>; <a href="#ref">Dyer, 1985</a>; <a href="#ref">Gagliardi, 1986</a>; <a href="#ref">Lewin,
1952</a>] agree that these changes may face resistance from staff within the
organisation. Resistance to impending change may not always be of human
origin as it may be the case that the existing physical infrastructure or
internal working procedures within the organisation may be incapable of
accommodating proposed changes.</p> 

<h4>GUIDELINES</h4>

<blockquote><p>In this first stage, the MISCO Support Team and the MISCO
Management Committee should garner opinions and views from all pertinent
organisational personnel. It should be appreciated that this stage
incorporates a feasibility study from which is generated a list of
recognised issues. These issues should be prioritised, similar to the role
of a Risk Register in project management. The Qualitative and quantitative
data should be used in order to research and identify internal and external
pressures.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Stage 2: IT Training and Education</h3>

<p>The feasibility
study from Stage 1 is used as a basis for identifying key areas of the
organisation where attitude, belief and value change is necessary to fully
implement the system. The feasibility study facilitates identification of
the level and extent of IT training and education required. This training
and education will then be used to penetrate the organisation's "cultural
barrier" (discussed later). The research has shown that the use of an
internal change agent greatly enhances acceptance of the change programme.
Stage 2 can be described as an IT preparatory stage which will be built
upon with the constructs within Stage 3.</p> 

<h4>GUIDELINES</h4>

<blockquote><p>The MISCO Support Team and the MISCO Management Committee
should, with reference to the feasibility study, clarify which
organisational member will participate in the proposed change process. If
these members require assistance and support from higher management levels
(or external organisations, eg, for training), this should be clearly
stated.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Stage 3: Cultural and Organisational Change</h3>

<p>This stage consists
of six steps which, if possible, should be carried out simultaneously. Note
that the schematic does not suggest that these activities are executed
sequentially. The overlap of the six "discs" of change are present to
suggest sequential activity. The research has shown that the SME culture
and organisation change-process is non-linear, hence the suggestion for
simultaneous execution of the six steps. The prospect of change can be
daunting for many SME employees. Questions may arise about whether the
impending change will adversely affect an employee's established working
routines or whether the change will significantly reduce that employee's
role.</p> 

<p>Employee emotions and feelings such as fear,
stress and a tendency to be objectionable or argumentative are some of the
more common traits which must be overcome. The change agent (or team) must
be aware that the key to overcoming these apprehensions is support.
Employees may be sceptical regarding the impending change programme. This
scepticism can manifest itself in the form of questioning the merits of
change. Being openly opposed to the merits of the change programme,
employees may cite previous (failed) attempts at IS introduction. Employees
may also feel it appropriate to talk with other employees, rather than
approach management or the change agent with any concerns, often
exacerbating their fears in the process. </p> 

<p>Core
competency, or the aptitude and proficiency of organisational members, can
be used to measure the acceptance or rejection of activities or behaviour
of an organisational member. Competence can therefore indicate the cultural
bearing of the organisation. The schematic depicts a distinction between
the cultural and structural/organisational contexts. Six "discs" of
cultural change straddle the dividing line between the cultural and
organisational contexts. The change steps (IT pilot schemes, communication,
education, facilitation, mentoring and dissemination) embrace and impact on
both cultural and structural change. These six steps will now be
discussed.</p>

<h4>STEP 1-PS:&#9;PILOT SCHEMES</h4>

<p>The research has shown that the use of IT pilot schemes greatly enhances the chances of user
participation for the full MIS implementation. Pilot schemes allow the
change agent to perform an "implementation test" with organisational
members. The change agent is provided with the opportunity to appraise
people's attitudes and aptitudes regarding IT and the change programme in
general. Extending existing Information Systems, or introducing small
projects, in this manner acclimates those users who may be technophobic.
Additionally, this step can identify functions required by the MIS. The
change agent should be prepared to execute a "hands-on" approach during
implementation of pilot schemes which demonstrates a commitment to IT and
IS implementations.</p>

<h4>STEP 2-CM:&#9;COMMUNICATION</h4>

<p>The
change agent should be aware that communication with all employees affected
by the incoming MIS is of vital importance. Conversations should be pitched
at an appropriate level, using non-technical terminology with technophobic
personnel. Putting employees at ease and assuring them that comments would
not be reported to management greatly encourages proactive and genuine
debate. Constant encouragement such as this can elicit valuable opinions on
the change programme and the MIS.</p> 

<h4>STEP 3-ED:&#9;EDUCATION</h4>

<p>To expedite progress of the project, IT training (first encountered in Stage
2) should be continued. Imparting technical knowledge and skills allows
users to participate fully, particularly during staged implementations. If
the necessary technical abilities or training abilities are unavailable
in-house, the organisation (via the MISCO Support Team or the MISCO
Management Committee) should arrange for an external agent or organisation
to convey the merits of the new system.</p> 

<h4>STEP 4-FC:&#9;FACILITATION</h4>

<p>The research demonstrates the need for an internal change agent or change management team. The
intrinsic nature of a SME means that external consultants, be they
associated with change programmes or not, can be treated with suspicion.
Employees may question the validity of external assistance, arguing that
the organisation already possesses sufficient expertise. The research shows
that constant reassurance is an integral part of the change process. The
internal change agent (or facilitator) should constantly monitor, control
and evaluate progress of the MIS implementation.</p>

<h4>STEP 5-DS:&#9;DISSEMINATION</h4>

<p>Disseminating the benefits of MIS and the success of IT pilot schemes throughout the organisation is of vital
importance. The success and benefits of these schemes and implementations
will assist sceptical employees. Pertinent decisions, outcomes and
proceedings from meetings involving the MISCO Support Team and the MISCO
Management Committee should be promulgated throughout the organisation.
This may be appropriate through the use of team or department meetings,
memos or emails.</p> 

<h4>STEP 6-MN:&#9;MENTORING</h4>

<p>The change agent should be prepared to guide and monitor employees regarding
their perceptions or resistance towards technology and the MIS. One-to-one
discussions can alleviate such fears and change agents should, via
organisational dissemination, ensure that employees are fully aware that
mentoring opportunities are available. Some employees may be reluctant to
voice their fears or concerns in front of their peers or department heads.
It is vital that all employees give full support to the MIS implementation
and it is therefore important that all concerns are alleviated.</p> 

<h4>GUIDELINES</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Concurrent tasks and activities</i>. The MISCO model, as part of its fundamental precepts,
emphasises the need to execute tasks and activities concurrently.
Sequential tasks increase the overall time taken to complete activities.
This decrease in productivity can also lead to decreased motivation, again
impacting on productivity. The MISCO model depicts the need to carry out
the "six discs" (IT pilot schemes, communication, education, facilitation,
dissemination and mentoring) of cultural change concurrently. It is
reiterated that the schematic does not suggest that activities are to be
executed sequentially.</p>

<p><i>Introduce improved communication methods</i>. Information exchange can be carried out either
synchronously (interacting at the same time, for example a telephone
conversation) or asynchronously (interacting at different times, for
example exchange of emails). Experiences from Thermo-X and discussions with
the external organisations suggest that asynchronous communication can be
more effective that synchronous communication. Synchronous communication
often means an inefficient use of time. Asynchronous communication can be
improved by the use of group or departmental notice-boards, "active" trays
and the exchange of email. Use of these methods allow users to think and
debate key issues before responding, rather than giving an ill-informed
"knee-jerk" response to questions.</p>

<p><i>Central data store</i>. As discussed, outcomes and issues from MISCO team meetings
should be properly documented and recorded. Data stores can either be paper
or computer-based. It is suggested that one of these two methods is used,
but not both. Use of more than one data store for the same type of data can
cause inconsistency problems. Such problems can have an impact on
productivity and team motivation. The research experience demonstrates that
unclear, out-dated data leads to a large number of inconsistency problems.
These problems often lead to data integrity errors, causing yet more
problems for the organisation.</p>

<p><i>Reduction of information flows</i>. Organisational efficiency should not be at the
expense of organisational effectiveness. Information flows within MISCO
should be relevant and concise. The presence of too much information can
lead to confusion, stress and incorrect dissemination of activities and
information. The role of department managers within the MISCO model has
been well defined. Excessive information dissemination impacts on the role
of department managers who then also assume a "messenger"-type role,
providing (incorrect and unnecessary) information to department members.
The use of electronic databases and effective filtering techniques can
assist the elimination of excessive data and information.</p>

<p><i>Reducing control</i>. The MISCO model encourages employee
empowerment as the research has shown that this increases productivity and
motivation for the MIS. Excessive control can severely reduce motivation
and enthusiasm for the change programme. Without empowerment,
responsibility for checking work and reports is then borne by departmental
and top-line management, increasing workload. Additionally, employees
become aware that these reports are to be checked by their managers which
can lead to a slovenly approach to their work.</p>

<p><i>Limited number of contact points</i>. The MISCO model encourages
interaction between team members and departments. This interaction will
involve contact between the change agents, employees, department managers
and top-line management. The research has shown that contact points can
generate delays and inconsistencies. Where excessive, this can lead to
organisational dissatisfaction and a reduction in motivation.</p>

<p><i>Simplifying complex tasks and activities</i>. Intricate
and complex tasks, activities and processes should, where possible, be
simplified into simpler ones. Simplification fosters motivation, increases
clarity and reduces workload for employees. Confusion and mistakes are
reduced when clarity and full understanding is achieved. Decomposition of
tasks and activities assists management in the monitoring, control,
co-ordination and evaluation of these processes. Simplification of tasks
can enable the change agent to work on various processes
simultaneously.</p></blockquote>



<h3>Analysis and Evaluation</h3>


<p>Having carried out
the culture and organisation change steps in Stage 3, the model attempts to
move to the next stage. Before doing so however, the effects of the six
steps are appraised and evaluated. If it is felt that the effects of change
have not been sufficient or if instigated changes have not been
established, this is indicative of an ineffective change program.
Deficiencies of the organisations or of the culture-organisation change
process should be noted and the facilitator, following the feedback line,
should return to Stage 2 (IT Training and Education).</p> 

<h4>GUIDELINES</h4>

<blockquote><p>Returning to Stage 2 should not be regarded as a major
organisational (or a personal failing on part of the facilitator). Changing
organisational culture and employee attitudes is a very difficult process.
If the Analysis and Evaluation phase does confirm inadequacies of the
change programme, these should be regarded with a positive attitude as the
opportunity is then present to resolve these issues before they can be
exacerbated.</p></blockquote>


<h3>Stage 4: Acceptance</h3>

<p>If the Analysis and Evaluation phase does not identify any inadequacies, the model moves to
Stage 4 (Acceptance). This stage is reached when cultural and structural
change methods have been successfully deployed within the organisation.</p>



<h4>GUIDELINES</h4>

<blockquote><p>The facilitator should be aware that, in this stage,
acceptance is a state reached when, and only when, analysis and evaluation
has been properly - and honestly - executed.</p></blockquote>


<h3>Stage 5: Stability</h3>


<p>Having reached the
Acceptance stage, re-entering the cultural barrier if necessary to resolve
any difficulties, the MISCO framework takes an evolutionary route to the
Stability stage. The route to this stage should be supported by continued
mentoring and facilitation, elements already displayed and conveyed by the
change manager. Although nearing the final stages, the transition between
the Acceptance and Stability stages should not be executed complacently.
Only when full Stability has been achieved should the change-manager be
sure that his work is complete.</p>


<h4>GUIDELINES</h4>


<blockquote><p>The facilitator should be aware that the stability stage may,
with time, feedback to the recognition phase (Stage 1). Documentation of
key stage activities should be continued at this point. It is recommended
that a handover report be generated so that another change agent can be
made aware of previous change-management issues within the
organisation.</p></blockquote>



<p>Re-Evaluation, Revision and Re-Entry feedback</p>
<p>Having achieved the
objective of attaining a new culture, (a culture which has successfully
accommodated a MIS and which has made appropriate changes to organisational
structure), the organisation may, given time and experience, return to our
original starting position. This position was one where the management of
the organisation have recognised that a culture and organisation change may
be necessary.</p> 


<p>The Empowerment Arrow:
Organisational and Structural Change</p>

<p>The entire MISCO involves a desired move from
an autocratic organisational structure to a more autonomous structure. The
research confirms that this should be carrying out by empowering employees
to take increased responsibility and a more proactive role in their
everyday tasks. The presence of the "empowerment" arrow seemingly to a
point external from the main model should not nullify its importance to the
MISCO framework.</p>

<h4>GUIDELINES</h4>

<blockquote><p>The research originally conceptualised a shift from the
organisational "temple" model to a "matrix" structure. The more realistic
depiction of a move from an autocratic arrangement to a more autonomous
structure, without the regimented labelling of "temple" and "matrix",
reduces pressure on the MISCO Support Team and the MISCO Management
Committee.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The importance of Core Competency</h3>

<p>Views of <a href="#ref">McAuley</a> [1994] and <a href="#ref">Bate</a> [1990] are reflected in the framework. Competency, the
aptitude and proficiency of organisational members, can be used to measure
the acceptance or rejection of activities or behaviour of an organisational
member. Competence can therefore indicate the cultural bearing of the
organisation. The importance of the link between organisational culture and
core competency is brought sharply into focus by <a href="#ref">McAuley's</a> [1994] comment
that if certain <i>competent </i>organisational members and a core
<i>cultural component </i>of are at odds, the same behavior that was once
considered "competent" can now be incompetent. As a result of this
association, the inclusion of core competency has an important role to play
in the new MISCO Model. </p>

<h2>Conclusion and Implications</h2>

<p>Culture change is often necessary when implementing far-reaching Information Technology programmes into SMEs. The anticpated benefits of IT implementations must be offset with the operational-procedure changes necessary to both initially receive and successfully accommodate the new technology. This paper has established the cultural and organisational aspects of implementing a Management Information System into a UK-based SME, has formulated an innovative implementation framework which such a firm could use to implement a MIS and has analysed and considered the role and importance of management during
the change process. </p> 

<p>Organisational and cultural
changes can be a key inhibitor or facilitator to successful implementation.
However, attempting to change an organisation's culture is far from easy.
The change process is riddled with a variety of challenging barriers which
must be overcome in order to change the culture. Recognising and
acknowledging the existence and complexity of these difficulties is central
to the change process as, without this recognition, cultural and structural
change will meet with failure, as will the anticipated benefits of the IT
implementation.</p> 

<p>The new Model has been put forward
to present novel variables regarding Organisational and Cultural attitudes
when implementing Management Information Systems. The Model requires
empirical verification and validation upon which further work can be based
in order to expand on the ideological concepts presented. Triangulation
techniques [<a href="#ref">Taylor &amp; Bogdan, 1984</a>; <a href="#ref">Gummesson, 1988</a>; <a href="#ref">Stake, 1995</a>] can
continue and be extended. Quantitative data techniques, perhaps in the form
of detailed questionnaires, can be used to further validate the research
findings.</p> 

<p>The focus of this research has been on
UK-based SMEs operating in a manufacturing environment. Opportunities may
exist to expand on this by applying and refining the MISCO Model in other
industries, such as service and retail, in order to form either a generic
framework or specific model for these industries. The complexity of culture
has been discussed within this paper. The applicability and validity of
cultural identity and semantics results in varying definitions of culture.
It is suggested that applying the MISCO Model to companies outside the UK
(perhaps in Europe and the United States) would require a major
re-evaluation of the conceptual constructs. Immersion in and experience
from these different cultures may well result in a different MISCO
Model.</p> 

<p>It is now up to academics and IT
practitioners to use the proposed MISCO Model, either in its existing form
or after modification, in order to exploit its usefulness to UK-based
SMEs.</p>

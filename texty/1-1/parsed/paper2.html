<h2>Computer-supported collaborative work and learning</h2>

<p>A new research group has recently been <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>in the
Department, focusing upon electronic  support for collaborative learning
and work.  In the area of computer-supported collaborative  learning
(CSCL), we are exploring and developing new pedagogic models for
learning, using  electronic support and learner-centred <span>approaches</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>  For
example, our current activities involve the  exploitation of appropriate
technology to support open and distance learning, and the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>of 
curricula based upon constructivist and experiential learning principles
(<a name="duffy"></a><a href="#duffyt">Duffy & Jonassen, 1992</a>; <a name="duffy"
></a><a href="#kolbd">Kolb, 1984</a>).   The research  group supports
departmental <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning innovations as well as pursuing its
wider  research agenda.  In the area of computer-supported collaborative
work (CSCW), we are  interested in the changing <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>for
collaborative work <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>by new technologies, from both  managerial
and social-psychological perspectives.  The British Library has recently
awarded the  group a grant to undertake a sixteen-month project entitled
Communicating Effectively in the  Networked Library.</p>

<h2>Action research</h2>

<p>Action research into our own <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>practice is an important
<span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>of learning for the group.   Here, we describe the nature of
<span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>research, and describe its use in the on-going development  and
evaluation of a new undergraduate module. We hope to show that an action
research  approach to <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>can be used to improve <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>and
learning practice.</p>

<p>Action research has been used in many areas where an understanding
of complex social situations  has been <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>in order to improve the
<span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>of life. Among these are <span>industrial</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span> health and  <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>work
settings.  Kurt Lewin, often cited as the originator of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>research
(<a name="mckernan"></a><a href="#mckernanj">McKernan, 1991</a>), used
 the methodology in his work with people affected by post-war social
problems.  Action research  <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>to educational research were
adopted in the <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>60s and early 70s by the ‘teacher- researcher’
movement in the <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>education sector.  This <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>to bring the
practising  classroom teacher into the research process as the most
effective <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>to identify problems and  to find <span>solutions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>We believe that an <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>research approach can contribute very
positively to activity within the  tertiary sector concerned with
<span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span><span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>issues, and with national Teaching <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span> Assessment
initiatives.  As "reflective practitioners" (<a name="schon"></a><a href="#schond" name=" "
>Schon,1983</a>), we can achieve greater ownership of the  evaluative
process by becoming systematically self-assessing, along0e, and
feeding into,  external assessment processes:</p>

<blockquote>"Through systematic, <span>controlled</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span><span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>research, higher
<span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>teachers can become  more professional, more interested in
pedagogical aspects of higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>and more  motivated to integrate
their research and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>interests in a holistic way.  This, in turn,
 can lead to greater job satisfaction, better academic programmes,
improvement of student  learning and practitioner’s insights and
<span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>to the advancement of knowledge in  higher <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>"
<address>(Zuber-Skerritt, 1982: 15)</address>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite progress in understanding of the way in which people learn
and the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>of learning  environments, <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>practice in higher
<span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>often remains unaffected.  Traditionally,  lecturers have not
been encouraged to draw upon theoretical developments as a means of 
improving curriculum <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>and delivery.  However, more recently, a
number of initiatives at  national and local levels have been
<span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>to create the conditions for innovation in these 
activities, and teaching/learning is becoming recognised as a more valid
area of enquiry for  academics across all disciplines, rather than as
the unique preserve of specialists.</p>

<p>Action research methodology <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>a systematic approach to
introducing innovations in <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span> and learning.  It seeks to do this
by putting the teacher in the dual role of producer of educational 
theory, and user of that theory.  This is both a way of producing
knowledge about higher  <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>learning and <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span> and a powerful
way of improving learning and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>practice.   No separation need be
made between the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>and delivery of <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span> and the process of 
researching these activities, thereby bringing theory and practice
closer together.</p>

<p>A variety of forms of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>research have evolved (<a name="carr"></a><a href="#carrw"
>Carr &amp; Kemmis, 1986</a>) .  All adopt a methodical, iterative  approach
embracing problem identification, <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>planning, implementation,
evaluation, and  reflection.  The insights gained from the initial cycle
feed into planning of the second cycle, for  which the <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>plan is
modified and the research process repeated (Figure 1).</p>

<p><img src="diagr1.gif"></p>

<p><a name="kolb"></a><a href="#kolbd">Kolb (1984)</a>  <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>this
model to offer a conception of the <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>research cycle as a learning 
process, whereby people learn and create knowledge by critically
reflecting upon their own  actions and experiences, forming abstract
concepts, and <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>the implications of these concepts  in new
situations.  Practitioners can create their own knowledge and
understanding of a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span> and act upon it, thereby improving
practice and advancing knowledge in the field.</p>

<p>Action research has a number of further distinctive <span>features</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span> as
described by <a name="zuber"></a><a href="#zubers">Zuber-Skerritt,
(1982)</a>.    For her, <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>research is:</p>

<ul><li><i>Critical </i>collaborative enquiry by</li>
<li><i>Reflective </i>practitioners who are</li>
<li><i>Accountable </i> in making the results of their enquiry public,</li>
<li><i>Self-evaluative </i> in their practice, and engaged in</li>
<li><i>Participative </i>problem-solving and continuing professional
development.</li></ul>

<p>According to this view, <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>research is critical in the sense
that practitioners not only look for  ways to improve their practice
within the various constraints of the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>in which they are 
working, but are also critical change agents of those constraints, and
of themselves.  It is  reflective in that participants analyse and
develop concepts and theories about their experiences.   Action
researchers are accountable in that they aim to make their learning
process and its results  public, both to each other and to other
interested practitioners, using accessible <span>terminology</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>   Their practice
is self-evaluated in that the reflective and analytical insights of the
researcher- practitioners themselves form the basis of the developmental
process.  Action research is  participative in that those involved
contribute equally to the inquiry, and collaborative in that the 
researcher is not an expert doing research from an external <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>
but a partner working  with and for those affected by the problem and
the way in which it is tackled.</p>

<h2>Curriculum Development</h2>

<p>We have decided to take a group-based <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>research approach to
the development of an  introductory undergraduate module on the use of
computer-mediated communications, entitled  <span>Elements</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>of Information
Management: communicating effectively in the networked organisation.  
This activity has been <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>by funding from Sheffield University
Curriculum <span>Development</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span> Fund, enabling one of us to devote time to
formalising a <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span><span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>research approach.  We  hope to develop a
model based upon our experience which will be transferable to other 
curriculum development initiatives.</p>

<p>Our curriculum <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>seeks to address two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>objectives in
undergraduate education: firstly,  to enable <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>to experience
"deep" learning; and secondly, to facilitate the development of 
transferable skills.  It has long been recognised that traditional
<span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>techniques often fail to  encourage "deep" learning of subject
content, which goes beyond short-term rote memorisation to  enable the
assimilation of new knowledge in a way which allows re-application to
<span>novel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span> situations (<a name="entwhistle"></a><a href="#entwhistlen">Entwhistle,
1988</a>).  Strategies to develop transferable skills in areas such as
thinking and learning,  self-management, communication, group work and
information management, are <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>to  prepare <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>for work
<span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>of the academic <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>in which they are learned initially.</p>

<p>The <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy we have decided upon uses experiential and
constructivist learning  principles (<a name="duffy2"></a><a href="#duffyt"
>Duffy & Jonassen, 1992</a>;<a name="kolb2"></a> <a href="#kolbd">Kolb,1984</a>;
<a name="boud"></a> <a href="#boudd">Boud, et al., 1985</a>).  For
much of the module, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>are engaged in a group-based collaborative 
project <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>by the use of computer-mediated communication
technologies such as  electronic mail, asynchronous conferencing and
synchronous chat.  This is complemented by a  <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>of
individually-based learning activities.  Students are provided with a
<span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>of on-line  information resources, and have access to tutor
support via electronic mail and face-to-face  meetings as necessary.  A
<span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>issue for us as <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>researchers is to come to an understanding 
of the nature and level of support required by <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>to gain the most
from their learning  activities.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>key question associated with this
is: what is the necessary <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>between  externally-imposed structure
and control and the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>freedom to be self-directed?</p>

<p>A number of <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>of the way we have decided to work on this
module mark the approach as  being one of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>research:</p>

<p><i>We aim to apply the model <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>by the <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>research cycle.</i></p>

<p>Although not yet complete, the development of the module is
following the <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>research cycle  illustrated earlier.  By completion
of the first cycle, we will have:</p>

<ul><li>identified a number of objectives and <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>initial working
hypotheses about meeting them.   For instance, a key objective is to
provide an appropriate <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>for deep learning, for  which we
believe it will be necessary to encourage maximum student ownership of
the  learning process;</li>

<li>planned a curriculum model and <span>devised</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>materials and processes to
support it.  For instance, a  key <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>of our curriculum model is
<span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span> engagement in collaborative group  project work.  Materials
and processes to support this include process workbooks and  learning
diaries for individual work, process workshops to support positive group
 functioning, and on-line tutor support.</li>
 
<li>put these into practice by running the module.  The module is based
upon one hour of theory  workshop and two hours of project work per
week, over one semester.  The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>form of  assessment is by coursework
(the group project), supplemented by individually-produced  learning
diaries.</li>

<li>made observations on our practice and evaluated its effects. 
Evaluation and self-assessment  <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>include a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>of on-going
student feedback <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>and tutor debriefings.</li>

<li>reflected upon the results of the evaluation, in preparation for
modifying our practice for the  second implementation of the module. 
For instance, at present the <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>for  student project work
is relatively <span>limited</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>  Given that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>participating in the module 
come from a very wide diversity of academic disciplines, which are
likely to <span>hold</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span> distinctive perspectives on computer-mediated
communication, we would like to open this  up to greater student choice
in <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>if appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>We intend that the inquiry is critical in spirit and purpose.</i></p>

<p>We believe that it is useful for our own development to perceive
ourselves as a "critical  <span>community</span>" <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span> of practitioners who not only want
to improve the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning in  higher education
within the constraints and <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>con0erations imposed upon us, but
who  also seek to be change agents of those constraints.  For instance,
assessment by examination is  traditionally imposed at University level
for this type of module; we anticipate and hope that its  outcomes will
justify the <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>elimination of this form of assessment in future
implementation.</p>

<p><i>We aim to be reflective and self-evaluating.</i></p>

<p>Insights gained from reflection and analysis of our practice will be
fed back into practice.  There  will be continuous re-assessment of the
module and its structure.  Built into the module are  <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>which
remind and encourage us to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>systematically on our activities. 
For  instance, as tutors we keep a collaborative on-line ‘tutor diary’
in which we share our reflections  on <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>performance, content,
course structure, student <span>response</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span> etc., relating them to prior 
experience and to teaching/learning theory.  Individual experience is
thus made available between  colleagues for comment and analysis, and we
attempt to challenge as well as support each other.   This semi-public
sharing of experience creates a collegial, collaborative approach to our
personal  professional development.</p>

<p><i>We are accountable.</i></p>

<p>We intend to make public the results of our evaluation, and the
process by which it was <span>achieved</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>  both locally and more widely.</p>

<p><i>We are engaged in participative problem-solving.</i></p>

<p>Those doing the research and those doing the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>are one and
the same. We have not  employed external evaluators to assess the
module; rather, we work together to gather data during  its development
and implementation which will then be analysed collectively, taking
account of  the point of view of each of us.  We believe that reporting
of the project should similarly embrace  all points of view, and reports
will be jointly written.</p> 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We do not expect to achieve a cut-and-dried solution to the
objectives we have identified, and we  are not concerned with producing
a strictly generalisable model of learning or <span>teaching</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>   However, we do
hope that fellow practitioners will find our experiences useful, both as
an  example of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:57px 19px 57px 19px;position:relative;">.</span>research and as a curriculum model.  We would
welcome communication with  others working in similar ways on curriculum
development within the field of information  studies.</p>

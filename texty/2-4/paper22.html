<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
There are increasing numbers of historical texts available in
machine-readable form.  These texts retain the original spelling,
which can be very different from the modern-day equivalents due
to the natural evolution of a language, and to the fact that the
concept of standardisation in spelling is a comparatively modern
one.  Among medieval vernacular writers, the same word could be
spelled in different ways and the same author (or scribe) might
even use several alternative spellings in the same passage.  For
example, the French text used in our experiments (described below)
variously gives the name of the chief villain as <i>Hoiaus, Hoiax,
Hoiel,</i> and <i>Oiaus.</i>  Thus, we do not know, <i>a priori</i>,
how many variant forms of a particular word there are in such
texts, let alone what these variants might be.  Searching on the
modern equivalent, or even the commonest historical variant, of
a particular word may thus fail to retrieve an appreciable number
of occurrences unless the searcher already has an extensive knowledge
of the language of the documents.   Moreover, even specialist
scholars may be unaware of some idiosyncratic variants.  Here,
we consider the use of computer methods to retrieve variant historical
spellings.</p>

<p>
Staff in the Department of French have been editing twelfth-century
French narrative poems and analysing the word-variants in them.
 Traditionally, this has involved teams of researchers recording
and classifying each word occurrence, but this has now become
impractical for texts of non-trivial size.  Previous work in the
Department of Information Studies has investigated the searching
of historical English text using algorithms developed for detecting
spelling errors (<a href="#rob">Robertson &amp; Willett, 1993</a>).  In this paper
we summarise the results of applying these algorithms to medieval
French literature; full details of the experiments are provided
by <a href="#oro">O'Rourke (1995)</a>.</p>

<h2>The Text</h2>
<p>
<i>Ille et Galeron</i> is a narrative poem telling of heroism
and romance, composed by Gautier d'Arras in the late twelfth century
and consisting of 6592 lines of text arranged in octosyllabic
rhyming couplets.  The two extant manuscripts are from the end
of the thirteenth century: one (P) is in Paris and the other (W)
in Nottingham.  The two manuscripts preserve rather different
versions of the text, and it seems possible that Gautier himself
composed two versions of the poem at different times for slightly
different audiences.  Our work uses the P text, together with
an English translation.  There has been no attempt to combine
the manuscripts into a consensus view, but as some lines are missing
from P, a small number of lines from W have been incorporated
to fill obvious gaps.  Modern punctuation has been added as the
original contains none.</p>

<p>
The poem is written in Old French, and a study of the rhyme-words
suggests that Gautier himself wrote in the literary form of the
language which was gaining currency in his day, and which was
becoming more standardised than the spoken word.  However, the
thirteenth-century scribe of P seems to have been of Picard origin,
and introduced a considerable number of dialectal variant forms
into the text that he copied.</p>

<h2>Spelling Correction Methods</h2>

<p>
The methods that we use for identifying word variants in historical
texts are based on methods that have been developed for automatic
spelling correction.  Thus, in a word processing system, a mis-spelt
word is searched against a dictionary of correct spellings to
find the most similar, with the expectation that this will be
the correct spelling.  In the present context, we search a modern
word against a dictionary of historical forms, with the most similar
being possible variants of the query word that should be considered
for inclusion in the query.</p>

<p>
There are three main sources of spelling errors in modern texts:
the input device, the text content, and the spelling skills of
the author.  Some 80% of errors are predictable and can be ascribed
to four simple processes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Insertion of a single character, e.g., <i>accounnt</i> for
<i>account</i>;
<li>Omission of a single character, e.g., <i>acount</i> for <i>account</i>;
<li>Substitution of one correct character by one incorrect character,
e.g., <i>accoant</i> for <i>account</i>;
<li>Transposition of two adjacent characters, e.g., <i>accuont</i>
for <i>account</i>
</ul>

<p>
The first two are by far the commonest, though combinations and
repetitions of the four are also possible (<a href="#dam">Damerau, 1964</a>).  First
letters are resistant to errors, while vowels and the letters
<i>w, y, h</i>, suffer a disproportionate number of corruptions.
 For instance, the vowels constitute less than a quarter of the
alphabet but account for three-fifths of spelling errors.  A misspelling
tends to be shorter than the correct form.  The longer a word
is,  the more variation there is in the length of its erroneous
variants (<a href="#yan">Yannakoudakis &amp; Fawthrop, 1983</a>).  The third character
seems especially at risk and the likelihood of a letter being
involved in an error is proportional to its frequency in the text
(<a href="#pol2">Pollock &amp; Zamora, 1983</a>).</p>

<p>
Spelling correction may be effected by either absolute or relative
methods (<a href="#pol1">Pollock, 1982</a>).  The former depend on a knowledge of
previous errors.  It is limited because such errors are unlikely
to recur in short pieces of text, and it cannot be applied to
medieval documents, because these contain a number of equally
valid variants,  rather than one &quot;correct&quot; and several
&quot;wrong&quot; forms, as occurs with modern texts.  The relative
method looks for &quot;similarity&quot; between words,  and regards
them as strings of characters.  There are three types of similarity
(<a href="#fau">Faulk, 1964</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Material:  the extent to which the strings contain the same
characters;
<li>Ordinal:  whether the matched characters occur in the same
order in the two strings;
<li>Positional:  whether the matched elements occur in the same
positions in the two strings.
</ul>

<p>
Of these, ordinal similarity seems most appropriate for the purposes
of variant identification, and all of the methods we have tested
are of this type.  </p>

<p>
It should be noted that concepts of  &quot;right&quot; and  &quot;wrong&quot;
spelling are not applicable to searching historical databases,
as all variants were equally acceptable at the time of writing.
 A further problem is that, ideally, the historical text may need
to be read as phrases rather than single words, as some of the
variant old-form spellings may be modern words in their own right
but with meanings that would not fit their context; however, the
word-based methods considered here are not appropriate for this
level of sophistication.</p>

<p>
Methods of spelling correction that have been applied to historical
text are: reverse error, phonetic and non-phonetic coding, <i>n</i>-grams,
and dynamic programming.  All of these methods, details of which
are given by <a href="#rob">Robertson and Willett</a> (1993), regard words as strings
of twenty-seven characters,  the twenty-six letters of the modern
alphabet and a space, but cannot take account of their meanings
in context.  The previous work considered only English from the
sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries but the methods should be
text independent, so that they can be applied to a wide variety
of texts, topics, historical periods and languages</p>
<h2>
Methodology</h2>

<h3>Preparation of the text</h3>
<p>
We stripped out all of the words from the poem, sorted the resulting
file and removed all of the duplicates to form a <i>master dictionary.
</i> We parsed the text, sentence by sentence, splitting the screen
to display the French text and English translation simultaneously
in order to construct a triple dictionary of each word in the
Medieval text (the <i>old-form</i>), its modern French equivalent
(the <i>modern-form</i>) and an approximate modern English meaning.
 Together these three sets of words comprise the test collection
that was used for our experiments.  In selecting modern French
words, we attempted to preserve the morphology of the old-form
word.  This meant using some words which are listed in a modern
French dictionary as &quot;archaic.&quot;  Such words,  though
they may still be used in print and poetically, are unlikely to
be heard in modern daily speech or to be first choices in end-user
searching.  For instance, we used <i>affoler </i>as the modern
equivalent of <i>afoler</i>, but a modern French speaker would
be likely to start searching on <i>tuer</i>, much as an English
searcher would start with <i>to kill </i>rather than  <i>to slay.</i>
 As the work is written as rhyming couplets, the endings of rhyme
words may be subject to variation, and syncopated forms may be
used to make the lines scan.</p>

<p>
Some modern French equivalents could be identified from a high-quality
contemporary dictionary, while more obscure words were found in
Godefroy's dictionary of ninth to fifteenth century French.  
This provides equivalent meanings in French contemporary with
its publication (1884-1902).  There is unfortunately room for
error in the second translation of  these terms into English because
the meaning of the &quot;modern&quot; French word may also have
changed in the last century.  Finding appropriate tenses and moods
of irregular verbs proved especially difficult, as in many places
the present tense appears to be used for completed events to increase
the sense of drama and action.  A hard core of unmatchable words
was still outstanding at the end of the project.  From the triple
dictionary, a <i>postings dictionary</i> was prepared.  This consists
of pairs of words with the modern-form first, as it was used as
the search term, followed by the old-form as found in the text.
 There is one pair for each old-form variant.</p>



<h3>Matching methods</h3>
<p>
In our experiments. we focused on the methods which had yielded
the best results in the work using the historical English texts
(<a href="#rob">Robertson &amp; Willett, 1993</a>).  These are <i>n-gram matching,</i>
and <i>longest common subsequences</i> (LCS).</p>

<h4>N-grams</h4>

<p>
An <i>n</i>-gram is a string of <i>n </i>adjacent characters derived
from a word at least <i>n</i> characters long.  <i>Digrams </i>have
a length of two, and <i>trigrams</i> have a length of three. 
One padding space is added at each end of the word in the case
of digrams, and three in the case of trigrams.  A word of <i>n</i>
characters will have <i>n</i>+1 digrams, and <i>n</i>+2 trigrams.
 For example, the word TORNEROIT is processed to generate the
digrams</p>
<p>
<center>*T TO OR RN NE ER RO OI IT T*</center>
<p>
and the trigrams 
<p>
<center>**T *TO TOR ORN RNE NER ERO ROI OIT IT* T**</center>
<p>
where &quot;*&quot; denotes a leading or trailing space.  The
modern-form of a query word is broken up into its constituent
<i>n</i>-grams; the old-form of each of the words in the master
dictionary is broken up in the same way, and the degree of match
is the number of <i>n</i>-grams in common, normalised for length
by the <i>Dice coefficient</i>.  If <i>X</i> is the number of
<i>n</i>-grams in the dictionary old-form, <i>Y</i> is the number
of  <i>n</i>-grams in the query modern form, and <i>C</i> is the
number of <i>n</i>-grams in common, then the Dice coefficient
is defined to be</p>

<div align="center"><img src="Image51.gif" width=46 height=41></div>

Values of the coefficient range from zero, where there are no
<i>n</i>-grams at all in common, to unity, where the sets of <i>n</i>-grams
are identical.  The putative matching old-forms are then sorted
in descending order according their Dice coefficient values.</p>

<h4>Longest Common Subsequences (LCS)</h4>

<p>
If <i>A</i> and <i>C</i> are strings of length <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>
(with both <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> being <img src="Image52.gif">
1 and with <i>m</i> <img src="Image53.gif"> <i>n</i>) such that
<i>C</i> could be obtained by deleting zero or more elements from
<i>A</i>, then <i>C</i> is a <i>subsequence</i> of <i>A</i>. 
Thus COURSE, for example, is a subsequence of<i> </i>COMPUTER
SCIENCE.  String <i>C</i> is a <i>common subsequence </i>of strings
<i>A </i>and <i>B</i> if it is a subsequence of both; it is the
<i>longest common subsequence</i>, or LCS, if it is a common subsequence,
and if it is at least as long as any other common subsequence
of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>.  The Dice coefficient is again used
for normalisation, but this time <i>X</i> and <i>Y </i>are the
lengths of the words being matched, and <i>C</i>  is the length
of the LCS.</p>

<h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
<p>
The effectiveness of retrieval was evaluated in a manner analogous
to that used for the evaluation of experimental document retrieval
systems.  For all of the matching methods (digrams, trigrams and
LCS), we took each of the modern-forms in the postings dictionary,
constructed a list of the ten or twenty words in the master dictionary
which are its nearest matches, and then compared this list against
the list of old-forms in the postings dictionary which are equivalent
to the query modern-form (<i>appropriate old-forms).</i>  The
<i>recall </i>of a search is defined to be the percentage of the
appropriate variants that are retrieved.  If a modern-form has
a set, <i>A,</i> of appropriate old-forms, and a set, <i>B&#184;</i>
of appropriate old-forms has been retrieved, then the recall is:</p>

<div align="center"><img src="Image53.gif">  100</div>


We found that recall rates of about 70% can be achieved in the
French text.  This is lower than for the historical English texts,
where recall rates of 85-95% could be achieved (<a href="#rob">Robertson &amp;
Willett, 1993</a>), but, as the French text is some three hundred
years older, its vocabulary is likely to be even more divergent
from modern language.  Overall, LCS performed better than <i>n</i>-gram
matching, and digrams were nearly always better than trigrams.
 In fact, there were no digram retrieval failures that could be
corrected by trigrams, while LCS was noticeably superior in this
respect, with 225 retrieval failures by one or both of the <i>n</i>-gram
methods that were retrieved by the LCS search.  That said, there
were some word pairs that were matched by digrams, but not by
LCS, <i>e.g.,</i>  <i>peur:paor</i> (although the similar pair
<i>peur:paour</i> was matched by LCS alone).  By contrast, there
are some matched pairs which elude all three of the algorithms.
<i>e.g.,</i> <i>peu:poi</i> Although LCS is the best of the
methods that we have tested for both English and French, it is
very demanding of computational time (Robertson &amp; Willett,
1993), and thus digram matching would probably be the method of
choice for incorporation into an operational system.  </p>

<p>
In conclusion, these experiments have demonstrated that techniques
for processing English text of the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries
can be applied without modification to French text of the thirteenth
century, though the comparative effectiveness is rather less due
to the greater age of the French text.</p>

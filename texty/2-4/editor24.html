<P>
This issue of <I>Information Research News</I> contains three
papers.  The first is a &quot;guest paper&quot; from Sirje Virkus
of the Tallin Pedagogical University, Estonia.  Sirje gives an
account of the potential for distance learning in the field of
information studies in Estonia.  In the second paper, Correia
and Wilson report the main results of an investigation of the
information-scanning activities of managers in the Portuguese
chemical industry; finally, O'Rourke <I>et al. </I>discuss the
application of methods that were originally developed for automatic
spelling correction to the identification of word variants in
historical French texts.
<p>
<p>In this issue we introduce a new feature - reviews of books and software - publishers please note that we are always ready to receive books for review.

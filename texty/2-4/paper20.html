<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Since Estonia regained its independence in 1991, essential technical, economic, political and social changes have taken place here. All sectors  of our economy require greater access 
to information than ever before. Complex changes are also facing libraries, librarians 
and education in Estonia. </p>

<p>The systematic transition to modern information technology in Estonian 
libraries started in 1992 when a plan for establishing information system 
for libraries was worked out. According to the Plan, basic technology will 
be converted to modern information technology during the period 1996-2005. 
As a result of that plan 1500 workplaces with modern information technology 
will be established in 591 libraries in Estonia. At present there are 1284 
libraries in Estonia, among them 604 public libraries, 745 school libraries, 
141 special and research libraries.   There are 3135 librarians working in Estonian libraries, of whom 48% are professionally educated <a href="#markus">(Markus 1996)</a>. 
<p>To define continuing education needs, a special questionnaire 
was used by the Estonian Librarians Association (ELA) among the members of 
ELA in February 1996. Almost 300 librarians answered the questionnaire. The 
analysis of the results showed that education and training is needed mostly 
in the fields based on modern information technology <a href="#talvi">(Talvi 
1996)</a>.</p> 

<p>According to the results of the questionnaire and the development plan 
for Estonian libraries mentioned above, the demand for continuing 
professional education for library and information professionals with the 
knowledge and skills of modern information technology exists and will increase 
significantly. </p>

<p>In order to help information professionals to keep abreast of the rapidly 
changing environment and to cope with growing continuing education needs, 
the Centre for Information Work was established within the Department of 
Information Studies at the Tallinn Pedagogical University (TPU)&nbsp;in June 
1995. In addition to traditional face-to-face courses, distance education 
as a new form and method of education has been implemented in the Centre. </p>

<h2>Distance education in Estonia </h2>
<p> Distance higher education in Europe is at the beginning of the third phase 
in its evolution <a href="#bang">(Bang 1995)</a> and distance learning, flexible 
learning, resource-based learning, open learning 
and computer-mediated learning are becoming commonplace in the progressive 
educator's vocabulary. Still, there is no widespread familiarity with the 
concept of modern distance education in Estonia. Distance education is associated 
by most people with the kind of correspondence education that was 
offered under the old regime and is often also associated with its most evident 
manifestation, i.e. technology. It is therefore important to convey an 
understanding of modern distance education to the Estonian educational systems 
<a href="#distance">(Distance 1993</a>). </p>

<p>At their meeting January 29, in 1993, the Nordic Council of Ministers 
made a ruling to support the Action Programme for the Baltic countries and 
neighbouring areas. In this Action Programme provisions 
&nbsp;were also made for educational projects in distance education. On this 
basis, the Council accepted an application from the President of &nbsp;the European Distance Education Network (EDEN) on behalf of the national associations of distance 
education in Finland, Norway, and Sweden to perform a feasibility study in 
the Baltic countries. The aims of the feasibility study were to:</p> 

<ul><li>assess the state of art of distance education in the three Baltic 
states, as well as to 
<li>identify the needs that exist for further development of distance education 
in the region <a href="#distance">(Distance..., 1993)</a>. 
</ul>

<p> In March 1993 the Central and Eastern European countries proposed, 
in the framework of the working group on regional initiatives in human resources, 
to establish a Regional Distance Education Network in co-operation with PHARE. 
As a first step a feasibility study on the development of such a Regional 
Distance Education Network in Central and Eastern Europe was commissioned 
and the European Association of Distance Teaching Universities &nbsp;(EADTU) 
was contracted to carry out this study with the Ministry of Culture and Education 
of Hungary as co-ordinator.   Feasibility studies on the development of modern distance education were carried out in 1993 by groups of experts engaged by the Nordic Council of Ministers and PHARE.</p>  

<p>In October 1993, at a seminar in Budapest for the official representatives 
of all eleven PHARE countries,  it was agreed unanimously that a Regional 
Distance Education Network should be set up with a long-term perspective. 
Following the feasibility study, a financing proposal was agreed in 1994 
for a three million ECU pilot project called PHARE &nbsp;Pilot Project for Multi-Country 
Co-operation in Distance Education. </p> 

<p>The pilot project aimed: </p> 
<ul><li>to act as a catalyst for national policy formulation in the field 
of distance education through measures for awareness raising, staff development, 
the presentation of existing models and mechanisms of distance education; 

<li>to establish a network of National Contact Points in the participating 
countries and to develop the necessary infrastructure in all countries to 
allow them to co-operate on an equal basis; 

<li>to develop on an experimental basis two pilot courses (European Studies 
and Training of Distance Trainers), thereby testing the feasibility of joint 
development by the participating countries of core course modules which can 
then be adapted to national requirements and context; 

<li>on the basis of the above items, to define areas of common interests in 
which regional co-operation can produce an important added value, in terms 
of enhanced quality of outputs, speed of development and/or economies of scale 
<a href="#benders">(Benders, 1996)</a>. 

</ul>
<p>The Estonian National Contact Point was established on 7th November,1994 
and Regional Centres were set up at the Tallinn Pedagogical University, the 
Tartu University and the Tallinn Technical University in the framework of PHARE 
Programme for Multi-Country Co-operation in Distance Education.   On August 22nd 1996 the international seminar <a href="http://www.tpu.ee/~i-foorum/act.htm">&quot;Modern Training and University Education&quot;</a> was arranged at the Tallinn Pedagogical University to discuss what has happened in the field of distance education in Estonia.    At this Seminar the main obstacles to delivering distance education widely in Estonia were pointed out:</p>  

<ul>
<li>lack of appropriate literature and printed materials; 
<li>lack of modern knowledge; 
<li>old-fashioned academic staff and subject-oriented teaching; 
<li>lack of ideology and/or policy at the strategy level about distance 
education; 
<li>few active learners <a href="#jogi">(J&otilde;gi 1996)</a>. 
</ul>

<p>Still, it was mentioned that the rapid development of a national 
telecommunication network provides a possibility to make use of the most 
recent information technology in the field of distance education. Connecting 
the libraries, information centres, universities and schools to the Internet 
gives good opportunity to disseminate distance education all over Estonia.</p>  

<h2>Distance education in library and information science education</h2>

<p>Education is in the midst of a monumental technological paradigm 
shift, one that will eventually change the way that all instructors teach 
and the way all students learn (<a href="#jensen">Jensen 1993)</a>. Information 
technology offers many 
options for the delivery of continuing education. Teaching, learning and 
learner support activity in higher education is moving increasingly into 
the 
new educational space created by electronic networks. A new mode of learning 
- <i>network learning </i>- &nbsp;is set to become a basic feature of higher 
education &nbsp;environment, and also 
holds considerable promise for the delivery of continued professional education and training <a href="#levy">(Levy &amp; Fowell, 1995)</a>. </p>

<p>For the transition from conventional learning to flexible learning,
especially targeted pilot projects will be used in the Centre for Information 
Work of the Department of Information Studies at the TPU. The Department 
is currently exploring and developing new pedagogic models for learning, 
using electronic support and learner-centred approaches to provide education 
to remote students. Our department has taken great interest in the use of 
network possibilities for distance learning purposes.  </p>


<h2>Distance learning pilot project for school librarians </h2>

<p>The distance education pilot project for school librarians is 
the first project in the Centre adopting flexible learning methods. Steps 
in the design and development of courses, identification of areas 
of need, selection of appropriate learning media, etc. began in 1995. 
The distance education pilot project for school librarians started in May 
1996 and will end in June 1997. </p>

<h3>The Aim of the Project</h3>

<p>The aim of the project is to bring quality in service and continuing 
education to school librarians in Estonia. This project also aims to enable 
participants to become aware of the potential of network possibilities, to 
gain some basic skills about network information seeking and retrieval, 
publishing on the Internet via the World Wide Web, public relations and marketing, 
user education, etc. Today, from the computer at home or at workplace, the 
educator or learner can access to the vast amount of library catalogues, 
journal indexes, reference books, full text of journal articles and books, 
art exhibits, employment notices, discussion groups, business data, etc. 
The learners in schools need help to convert information into knowledge, 
to avoid information overload and to identify the best sources for the specific 
needs and abilities of each learner. We do hope that the school library will 
play an active part in the educational process of every school in Estonia 
and will support the work of teachers and students in showing how to make use 
of the modern information sources available to them. </p>

<h3>The choice of technology</h3>

<p>Today there is a variety of technology available for transfer of 
knowledge from competence centres to specific target group: print - electronic 
publishing; television and radio broadcasts through earth stations, cable and 
satellites; audio and video cassettes; computer based training; interactive 
video, CDI &nbsp;and CD-ROM; multimedia; telephony; audio conferencing; video 
conferencing; e-mail and computer conferencing; audio graphics, etc. 
<a href="#bang">(Bang 1995)</a>.    This technology gives the possibility of reaching target groups, who - under normal circumstances - are disadvantaged regarding geography, economy, family, job and so on. We may say that recent innovations in technology have expanded distance education opportunities and even blurred the boundaries between 
distance and traditional education. </p>

<p>The Internet is a relatively new medium for enhancing and delivering distance 
learning courses. As a tool for distance learning, the Internet can both 
deliver the content and serve as a multipurpose communication tool. The Internet 
also supports the open learning concept: allowing students to connect to 
educational resources when it is convenient for them,  to explore the educational 
resources in an order that suits their needs and to learn at their own pace. </p>

<p>The choice of media will depend on the nature of the subject matter and 
skills to be covered, the knowledge level and prior skills of the learners, and 
the learners' and instructors' access to equipment. The choice of instructional 
media also depends greatly upon the budget of course developers. </p>

<p>Given the relatively high degree of access which schools have to computing 
&nbsp;and network facilities, electronic communication, especially synchronous and asynchronous communication possibilities of Internet, has an important role in the promotion of distance education to school librarians in Estonia. Many schools possess computers in Estonia and our schools are much more better equipped with information technology than our public libraries. The online aspect of distance education will continue to grow in Estonia as the number of schools equipped with telecommunications equipment and computers increase. There is a project called the <a href="http://www.tiigrihype.ee/">&quot;Tiger Leap&quot;</a> for school computerisation in Estonia. During the first step of &nbsp;the &quot;Tiger Leap&quot; project in 1997-1999 it is planned to supply all Estonian schools with computers (one computer with Internet connection per 10 to 20 students). Delivering distance education through Internet is also relatively inexpensive compared with another media in Estonia and teachers of informatics in schools may also support school librarians in their network learning activity.</p>

<p>We have used possibilities of the Internet in the Pilot Project for:</p> 
<ul><li>presentation of the learning material; 
<li>delivering course materials; 
<li>interaction between the learner and the learning material, and 
<li>communication between the learner and the teacher/tutor or among the 
learners 
themselves. 
</ul>

<p>We have used synchronous communication possibilities such as talk and asynchronous communication possibilities such as electronic mail, listserves and WWW, telnet, ftp, gopher. Learning materials have been distributed as ordinary mail (as ASCII-files) or as attachments (for formatted documents) to learners. The learning materials also appear in the form of World-Wide Web (WWW) pages accessible over the Internet and students are encouraged to explore the local and global networked information resources as well. We have created 
a set of Web pages for the course with pointers to some useful information sources for school librarians. </p>

<p>In order to offer common communication during a course, when all the 
group members shall receive the same information, KR-LIST has been created 
for school librarians. It enables course discussions and sending questions 
or comments to teaching faculty or classmates. Students submit written 
assignments to teaching faculty through e-mail, and assignments are returned 
with comments and suggestions in the same fashion. </p>

<h3>The content</h3>

<p>The Pilot project consists of four modules. Each module consists of 40 hours and includes face to face session, self studying, tutorial and group works. An introductory session of 16 hours was given during the first module using the traditional face-to-face method and 12 
additional hours were offered in order to prepare students for the telematics-based 
components of the course. Key aspects of distance education were covered and terms as distance education, flexible learning, resource-based learning and open learning were introduced to school librarians. An overview about challenges and school possibilities was also given. Topics covered include basic network concepts, Internet basic tools, network information seeking and retrieval, publishing on the Internet via the World Wide Web, public relation and marketing, user education and consulting.</p>

<p>Some of the advantages and difficulties experienced up to the present in using the Internet for educational delivery have been described below. The complete evaluation of the Pilot Project will follow in June 1997.</p>

<p>Advantages: </p>
<ul><li>providing learners with the ability to connect to learning resources 
when it is convenient for them; 
<li>the possibility of learning at their own pace; 
<li>allowing learners to use the educational resources in an order that 
suits 
their needs; 
<li>lower costs in producing of course materials compared to 
printing 
the same materials; 
<li>faster methods for revising and re-distributing course 
materials 
compared to print materials; 
<li>the ability to re-use lecture materials by simply providing links to previous 
electronic course modules or externally stored materials on the 
Internet; 
<li>using the World Wide Web for delivering course materials allows lecturers 
to produce content on a single platform, still the content is accessible 
by learners using 
a wide range of computing platforms and WWW browsers.

</ul>

<p>Difficulties: </p>
<ul><li>school librarians' experience in information and communication technology 
was relatively low; only one had practical network experience before; 
<li>it seems to us that even when school librarians have access to computers 
and knowledge about them generally, they still need considerable time to 
master the techniques involved in using e-mail for discussions and 
communications; 
<li>not all students are suited for Internet-based education; they are not 
able to express themselves as well using the computer-based communication 
methods as in direct conversation with their lecturers 
in the classroom; 
<li>some students feel isolated, lack confidence in their own abilities, 
and 
require careful support and encouragement; 
<li>students are not always highly motivated for personal competence development 
to study in isolation; 
<li>the cost of computer equipment and communications infrastructure limits the 
number of students who can afford an Internet-based course; 
<li>poor technical support or tutorial help can lead to incorrect usage of 
software 
tools. 
</ul>

<p>On 20th September 1996 the Department of Information Studies received a 
subsidy from the Open Estonian Foundation to start the long-term project on distance 
education for library and information professionals entitled Information 
Technology in Libraries.    The aim of the project is to start continuing professional education 
for library and information professionals using distance education methods in order to promote the realisation of the development program of the Estonian Library Information 
System. </p>

<p>The Project is planned for the period 1996-2000 and will 
include three stages:</p> 

<ul><li>distance education for librarians of scientific libraries; 
<li>distance education for librarians of central public libraries; 
<li>distance education for librarians of the other public libraries and school 
libraries. 
</ul>

<p>The project includes different modules: basic computer skills, integrated library systems, Internet basic tools, information seeking and retrieval in Internet and in commercial databases, generation of databases, electronic publishing, methods of analysing of information, Estonian information resources in the network environment, user education and consulting, etc.</p> 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This paper presents a brief overview of distance education as a new important field within the overall development of continuing education in Estonia. The Department of Information Studies of TPU is currently exploring and developing new pedagogic models for learning, using electronic support and learner-centred approaches to provide education to remote students. Our department has taken a great interest in the use of network possibilities for distance learning purposes. The distance education pilot project for school librarians has indicated the obvious distance education advantages of Internet, the difficulties in using this rapidly changing technology and has given us experience to improve the quality of distance learning in the Department of Information Studies of the TPU in future and  enable to apply obtained skills and knowledge in the long-term project &nbsp;entitled Information technology in libraries (1996-2000). Through the pilot project the technology will be tested and evaluated in order to develop methods for future use.</p>

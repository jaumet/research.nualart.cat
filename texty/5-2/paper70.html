<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Throughout the ages, one of the main interests for the  librarian and for library and information science (LIS) has been different types of referential and bibliographic databases. These (including catalogues and indexing &amp; abstracting services of different kinds) have been studied as compound 
meta-objects <a href="#NOT1">(1)</a> providing pointers to and descriptions of other objects of primary interest to the end-user. Characteristics of these meta-objects have been critical factors in 
determining the values of their use. Some of these characteristics may be metaphorically described as belonging to the <i>architecture</i> of meta-objects, which in practice is usually expressed in the "hierarchical" structuring of databases into records, fields and subfields or the "relational" 
structuring of databases into entities and relations.</p>

<p>In no respect has the same attention been given to the kind of objects - the 
textual containers - that they point to, as to their characteristics other than 
those relevant in predefined cataloguing practice and, in the case of citation 
indices, other than those that link scientific works together. Moreover, in 
Knowledge Organization, the preoccupation is with the rules and methods for 
classification and indexing. It seems as though one is reducing the objects of 
"input" to their mere possible inherent meanings. The basic material form and 
the factual, as well as the more abstract, textual structure of the objects 
have, to some degree, been regarded as transparent and self-evident, almost 
axiomatic starting points, offering little or no room for problematization and 
discussion.</p>

<p>We argue for a revaluation of this somewhat delimiting perspective, which we 
see as a <i>per se </i>reasonable outcome of the multicentennial hegemony of 
print technology. As print technology is complemented with digital technology, 
and as the latter is on its way to reframe the ways in which meta-objects might 
be construed, we want to emphasize the practice of <i>document studies</i>, 
hitherto largely neglected in LIS education and research. These studies must be 
conducted free from media chauvinism<a href="#NOT2"> 
(2)</a>, and may be realized in such subfields as e.g. production, management, 
delivery, organization, history, theory, materialities and sociology of 
documents as well as, of prime interest to this particular article, <i>document 
architecture </i>(DA). In this respect we may also relate to a number of 
disciplines - e.g. literary theory and analytical bibliography - where basic 
assumptions have been questioned pertaining to that supposed basic atomary unit 
in the architecture of large document corpora, notably the codex book or a 
journal issue. Digital carriers for bodies of text are handled by traditional, 
print-based institutions only with great difficulty, at times with considerable 
loss of information, and quite often in a misleading way. A brief consideration 
of digital documents vs systems such as legal deposits or descriptive 
cataloguing might by itself suggest our great need for new fields of research, 
education and course syllabi in LIS schools. <a 
href="#NOT3">(3)</a> Studies of digital production 
and distribution might also prove to be of value in re-theorizing technologies 
for reading and writing and their conditioning of textual carriers. This 
crossover may yield a reassessment of document architecture in its own right, 
and might thus make way for a rebirth of a subdiscipline largely disregarded in 
LIS. But let us first dig somewhat deeper into the very concept of DA.</p>

<h2><a name="The notion">The notion of document architecture</a></h2>

<p>With document architecture (DA) we mean several things implied by the 
metaphor <i>architecture</i>, besides the formal definition of ISO 8879:1986 
which reads "Rules for the formulation of text processing applications" (ISO 
8879:1986 clause 4.97). We believe that as the architecture of a building 
discloses a lot of e.g. the architect, his skill, the architectural style and 
its underlying truth-holdings of a functional and aesthetic building, DA 
discloses a lot of the practices and underlying theory of the production of the 
document.</p>

<p>DA as a concept is closely connected to a certain kind of "text processing 
applications", general markup languages (GML), where content is separated from 
presentation.</p>

<p>This structural strategy for digital representation is contrary to 
strategies, where documents are represented and processed with respect to their 
outlook: their positioning on the screen or on a sheet of paper. The latter 
perspective makes no difference between a picture and a sequence of alphanumeric 
characters. The former takes account for and stores unambiguous information on a 
document's structural elements, and is exemplified by SGML, XML and originally 
even HTML. <a href="#NOT4">(4)</a> This strategy may 
also contradict traditional text production strategies, where the writer tends 
to focus on appearance. Our observations when teaching LIS point to the fact 
that students learning HTML have extreme difficulties in understanding this 
concept of separation.<a href="#NOT5">(5)</a></p>

<p>In the context of general markup languages the concept of DA serves the 
purpose of signifying every more or less compelling system of rules that "deals 
with the document's purpose, its audience, its possible media, and the variety 
of ways that the document will be played, performed, displayed, accessed, 
transmitted, or read". (<a href="#Turner">Turner</a>, 1996: 10) Thus a bundle 
of instructions on how to render a document on a screen (such as a style sheet), 
as well as how packets of metadata may be inserted into the document, is part of 
the DA.</p>

<p>However, as all these rules depend on more or less temporary conceptions of 
how we might adequately produce documents and on technological constrains, the 
study of DA has a much broader scope than the purely technical bits.</p>

<p>The metaphor may be said to apply <i>both </i>to how these ideal models of 
text production work and become expressed in different media, both digital and 
analog, as structures of different document types, <i>and</i> how these models 
(or styles) form taxonomies of different but related styles. DA may then be 
studied as a matter of how to build, and - from the perspective of aesthetics - 
as investigations in different styles for different epochs, cultures and genres. 
And perhaps in the context of a "sociology of documents", as John Seely Brown 
and Paul Duguid seem to suggest:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;To fully assess the document's evolving role requires a broad 
  understanding of both old and new documents... They are also a powerful 
  resource for constructing and negotiating social space.&quot; (<a 
  href="#Brown">Brown &amp; Duguid</a>, 1996)</blockquote>
  

<p>With this conceptual background of DA, let us now turn to three contexts, 
where DA might be a tool for fuller understanding: information seeking, document 
(re)production, and theories of technology.</p>

<h2><a name="Information seeking">Document architecture and its importance for 
Information seeking</a></h2>

<p>Information seeking is often described as a "constructive process 
characterized by uncertainty and confusion", where an "information search is a 
learning process".(<a href="#Kuhlthau">Kuhlthau</a>, 
1993, pp 8-9) Thus the description seems to advocate for a perspective on 
research and education based on user perspectives, leaving out the 
system-oriented perspectives of the so called "bibliographic paradigm" (ibid., 
p. 1). There is no denying the fact that information seeking is always performed 
as actions highly dependent of personally situated and contextual factors, but 
it is our view that if the impact of a changing technology on information 
seeking will be determined, this must include an analysis of the relationships 
between DA and document representation - an analysis that calls for questions 
usually attributed to the domains of indexing and cataloguing, but extends their 
scope radically.</p>

<p>If we accept that analyses of information seeking missions sometimes may be 
characterized as investigations into how articulations of the needs of the users 
relate to the way documents are represented in different types of meta-objects, 
then we are also allowed to study the interplay of DA, document representation 
and user in an information seeking context. As far as we know, this kind of 
study has hitherto not been dealt with explicitly to any satisfying degree in 
LIS domains. This is not the forum to elaborate further upon this, merely to 
point out how different DAs are comprehended by different actors, and to hope 
for increased interest in these questions. Further empirical investigations into 
these matters would be welcomed, as we base our presentation here solely on our 
acquaintances with the web and our observations of how students deal with 
it.</p>
<h3><a name=examples>Examples of how architectural changes affects information 
seeking</a></h3>

<p>In learning to use the web, students in general have to get rid of several 
misunderstandings of the underlying technologies. <a 
href="#Pollock">Pollock &amp; Hockley</a> (1997), in 
a 1995 study on PC-literate users conducting searches on the web, came to the 
conclusion that "users need at least some understanding of basic Internet 
concepts in order to carry out successful searches". This study shows, among 
other things, how users fail to understand that articulation of their needs must 
be formulated according to how technology makes up a search language. Among LIS 
students the awareness of this is increasing, but the situation is still too 
much alikened to bibliographical database searching. There seems to be a strong 
tendency towards being as precise as possible in the hope that search engines 
will present <i>final</i> answers. It certainly would be better if search 
services expressed "search results as 'suggestions' rather than 'hits'" (<a 
href="#Pollock">ibid.</a>).</p>
<p>The misconceptions of how web searches may be performed are fairly natural as 
bibliographic systems always have been important for the LIS field and are 
emphasized in most courses on information seeking, where the main question at 
hand seems to be to find relevant textual objects and discriminate irrelevant 
ones. </p>
<p>In the following we will emphasize some architectural conditions of web 
documents that affect the use of search engines and other search services on the 
web. An example will be thoroughly elaborated, viz. how the concept of the title 
of a document plays an important role in a known-item search.</p>
<h3><a name=titles>Different worlds - different titles</a></h3>
<p>A known-item search occurs when the user has a limited but correct 
description of an existing document. The user is sure of the fact that the 
document exists, that its title and author are explicitly stated somewhere in 
the document, and these assumptions are true to the actual state of the 
docuverse. This situation is fairly different from when a user searches for 
unknown documents.</p>
<p>A known-item search in a bibliographic database is highly supported by the 
predictable, traditional DA. Almost every book has a stated title, 
responsibility, editor etc. Different codes for document description, as for 
instance the AACR2, prescribe that a representation of a document must include a 
statement of a document's title and author. It is obvious that, to some degree, 
conventions for producing documents have been adapted to facilitate such 
descriptions for the producer. The CIP is the most obvious example, where a 
bibliographic description is inserted into the document in a prescribed 
position. Thus documents making use of the CIP is an instance of a document type 
that defines a position as well as a form of expression for metadata <a 
href="#NOT6">(6)</a> conforming to library practice. 
These metadata are extracted, in accordance with cataloguing rules, from other 
parts of the document, e.g. the title page, which in its turn is another element 
of the conventional DA of a book.</p>
<p>Consequently, the user searching for a known book may rely on the fact that 
what he or she thinks is the title of a book is also true with respect to its 
representation in bibliographic databases. Exceptions are of course not too 
rare, due to orthographic fallacies and the like, but there are apparent 
correspondences between rules for generation of document representations in 
bibliographic databases and common sense apprehensions. </p>
<p>The user carrying out a search on the web, in Alta Vista, Infoseek or some 
other "search engine" can not rely on such a correspondence - for several 
reasons. For example, according to <a 
href="#Gudivada">Gudivada et al.</a> (1997), it has 
been estimated that 20 % of the objects on the web lack the title tag.</p>
<p>Admittedly, formal HTML specifications do prescribe the declaration of a 
title, but since current web browsers seem more or less to ignore if the HTML 
object conforms to formal rules or not, and since the producer of a web document 
not always recognizes the importance of significant titles, the result is that 
many web documents anyhow lack the title or have titles that make no sense. The 
problem may become less frequent with a transition from HTML to XML, as the 
latter imposes more strict regulations on the producers of browsers (XML 
processors). This may happen if XML processors, as is suggested (<a 
href="#Goldfarb">Goldfarb</a>, 1998), won't accept 
<i>ill-formed</i> documents, which means that an XML object, nonconformly 
encoded, will not be rendered at all and consequently will be unusable. With 
respect to this possible evolution it may be said that XML architecture is 
imposing further constrains on the writer and seems limiting, but at the same 
time makes expressions of this architecture more predictable, for generators of 
document representations as well as for readers. In the meantime it is a fact 
that the user of a search engine, especially a LIS student, expects that a 
search term attributed by <code>title:</code><a 
href="#NOT7">(7)</a> will match all documents with 
that term in the title. The fact is though that as the (formal) title is that 
part of the text manifested in the upper bar of the window, both readers and 
writers tend to regard the first heading or another visually prominent part as 
the title. Neglecting the meaning of the title tag may also cause the writer to 
omit it. The mismatch of the architectural definition of a title and the user's 
is obvious, and may be of critical importance, especially when the writer has 
represented the title with an in-line image, as images aren't indexed at all by 
search engines. </p>
<p>As cataloguing codes are beginning to adapt to new media in order to 
incorporate pointers to resources on the web in library catalogues, rules for 
determining the title of web documents are formulated. This is as far as we can 
see not done in a way that takes account of already existing (technical) 
definitions of the title or the unique architectures of web documents. In fact 
the ALA in a report last spring (<a 
href="#CC:DA">CC:DA</a> 1998) came to the conclusion 
that existing schemes for metadata (TEI and the Dublin Core) are of limited use 
in catalogue integration. It all seems as a tentative strategy to treat web 
documents as expressions of the (inherently different) architecture of journal 
articles, books or other types of printed documents. This strategy often 
concludes that the title is the visually most prominent part of the web object's 
rendition, usually a declared heading or the text of a GIF or JPEG image, in 
analogy with AACR2 rules for book description, which (naturally) makes 
references to visual appearance. </p>
<p>This may lead to a situation where not only do search engines and users 
diverge in their definitions of the title, in their models of what constitutes 
the architecture of a web site, but also where cataloguing rules develop another 
conception of the DA of web objects. </p>
<p>So if we say that different worlds take account of different titles, we may 
also say this about other architectural phenomena. </p>
<p>In a recent article on "citation in the digital era", Mats G. Lindquist 
remarks that "libraries are tied to the book and consider journals to be 
fragmented books". (<a 
href="#Lindquist">Lindquist</a>, 1999) A statement 
that may be compared to the remark of Luciano Canfora, that "[f]or librarians, 
the scroll was the 'unit of measurement'", implying that estimations of the 
contents of the Alexandrian library in most sources were highly exaggerated, 
since they were derived from "the practice of counting not works but scrolls". 
(<a href="#Canfora">Canfora</a>, 1990, p. 189) Since 
1994 we have seen that users may open <i>files</i>, <i>documents</i>, 
<i>URLs</i> and <i>sites</i> in the Archive menu of the browsers. At the moment 
we seem to be opening <i>pages</i> (in Netscape), though the word <i>page</i> 
here merely resembles what is usually meant by that word. Abundant examples 
witness to the fact that, as metaphors for a new technology are derived from 
older information technologies, this may cause unnecessary ambiguity <a 
href="#NOT8">(8)</a>. The concept of document is in 
itself somewhat of a metaphor, whereas it signifies a way of establishing 
borders for a coherent whole, by the help of reifying a conception of a 
collection of entities into a coherent work, a document.</p>
<p>Consequently, we believe that all this points to the relevance of a DA 
perspective, as it is important to elucidate the unique nature of the outcomes 
of a modern technology.</p>
<p>If we understand <i>technology</i> in its broadest sense, not restricted to 
<i>modern</i> technology, we may approach its essence in much the same way as 
Heidegger in <i><a href="#Heidegger">The Question 
Concerning Technology</a> </i>(1977), where technology is described by 
traditional "instrumental" and "anthropological" definitions. Technology, then, 
may be seen as "a means to an end" where "human activity" takes place in 
"bringing-forth". Thus writing and reading may be seen as activities for 
bringing forth human expressions - thereby using tools, which put necessary 
constrains on the activities. In these activities there is no way of becoming 
independent of technology. Language as well as inscribing tools (like the pencil 
or the keyboard) and storage media form a technology for writing and reading. A 
technology in which we "dwell", rather than use as a simple tool.</p>
<p>Thus, if we accept this view of technology as something that transforms, as 
well as is transformed by, mankind, any change in technology will affect the 
possibilities of expression, and this must be regarded as a critical factor in 
analyzing information seeking. </p>
<h2><a name="Literary works">Document architecture as a tool for understanding 
the production and construction of literary works</a></h2>
<p>This view of technology might be of some assistance to us when considering 
the importance of DA in the study and theory of <i>markup languages</i> as tools 
that shape, as well as are shaped by, our conception of possible DAs. As noted 
above, the term DA even originates in the realm of markup practices.</p>
<h3><a name="markup as a theory">Markup as a theory of DA</a></h3>
<p>DA becomes important when trying to understand metagrammars or schemes of how 
textual works are and can be constructed, most apparently so when we deal with 
the aforementioned markup languages for either the direct production of new 
digital works or the digitization of works previously represented in paper 
documents. As Michael <a 
href="#Sperberg">Sperberg-McQueen</a> notes (1991), 
a markup of a text <a href="#NOT9">(9)</a> is in 
fact a theory, or a theoretical statement, of this text. Extending this view, 
then, a general markup language is a general theory of texts. Note that that 
this usage of "texts" is more affiliated to that of text sociologists such as 
e.g. Donald McKenzie and Jerome McGann than to that of the kind of bibliography 
represented by e.g. Thomas G. Tanselle. The text concept of the latter is 
limited to the sequence(s) of linguistic alphanumerical signs, whereas the 
former aims to include, in McGann's terms (<a 
href="#McGann">McGann</a>, 1991), linguistic signs 
<i>as well as</i> bibliographical codes (such as typography, nature and quality 
of the storage medium, colouring etc), properties traditional bibliography would 
describe as belonging to the document level rather than to the text level. A 
number of tags used in various DTD:s in fact deal with the <i>architecture</i> 
of documents, since a markup language is a tool for structurally handling 
aspects and elements on different hierarchical and conceptual levels of the 
document, not only textual strings at the linguistic level. In this way we might 
consider certain families of markup languages as theories of particular types of 
documents or of genres, and as statements as to how these documents or groups of 
documents can in fact be constructed at all, and, finally and importantly, as 
tools perhaps shaping the very production of documents and their 
architectures.</p>
<p>Consider the universally intended grammar of SGML. SGML is not a markup 
language <i>per se</i>, but might instead be regarded as a markup 
<i>metagrammar</i> (certainly when we treat SGML in terms of an international 
standard, i.e. ISO 8879:1986), a system of rules out of which actual, derivative 
markup languages in turn might be constructed. In practice, user communities 
collaborate and discuss what types of elements are needed for certain types of 
documents and their markup (in particular when digitizing older literary works), 
and a formal Document Type Definition (DTD) is agreed upon <a 
href="#NOT10">(10)</a>. This process has to include 
the troublesome definition and consequent agreement on what are the important 
inherent elements in the documents at hand, i.e. an agreement on what 
<i>constitutes</i> the documents. <a 
href="#NOT11">(11)</a> This DTD has to be followed 
in order for documents to be universally exchangeable and processable within the 
intended user group. SGML was from its beginnings bound to the notion that DAs 
in general were characterized by ordered hierarchies of content objects, textual 
blocks that could not overlap. This was, in a manner of speaking, the nature of 
documents according to this theoretical view. Attempts were even made to 
establish theories of the ontological status of texts as consisting of content 
objects in a strict hierarchical order (<a 
href="#DeRose">DeRose et al</a>, 1990 ; summed up 
and elaborated in <a href="#Renear">Renear</a>, 
1997). This underlying philosophy of SGML defined and constrained the 
development of derivative applicational grammars - markup <i>languages</i> - 
such as TEI and HTML, thereby restricting these tools to a particular concept of 
DA. It soon turned out, however, that there in fact existed a number of document 
types that did contain overlapping hierarchies <a 
href="#NOT12">(12)</a>, contrary to the general 
theory of SGML, and therefore could be marked up according to a DTD of SGML only 
with considerable loss of adequacy. Where does that leave the "general" in 
General Markup Languages?</p>
<h3><a name="media transition">DA draws a media transitional circle</a></h3>
<p>The explosive growth of the web and the consequent widespread use of HTML and 
its tools, along with more or less explicit demands of adequately encoded HTML 
documents, have resulted in equal growth and spread of this architectural 
conception of SGML. The architectural view, upon which SGML and HTML originally 
were based, thereby might justify itself in a, as it were, roundabout way. The 
technological tool, the thing with which to write, will affect the thing 
written. The particular DA conception in SGML and derived languages will affect 
the production, collection, definition and analysis of documents, both as 
documents are originally produced electronically, and as paper-bound works are 
being digitized, and might consequently be of major interest to LIS. 
(Interestingly enough, digitization has offered opportunities for reframing the 
contents and architectures of manuscripts and printed books, forcing the 
digitizing agents to express, code and group digitized reproductions of not only 
the documents as entities, but also <i>parts of</i> the documents, whereby the 
entities as well as the parts can be handled in numerous ways, e.g. 
restructuring, searching, downloading, printing (again!) and commercializing (<a 
href="#G%F6ttingen">The Center for Retrospective 
Digitization</a>, 1999). This makes way, in a manner of speaking, for a more 
literal version of the infamous <i>deconstruction</i> of works, but this time a 
deconstruction not of the inherent meanings in works, but of the direct textual 
expression as manifested in the physical documents.) </p>
<p>With this in mind, we might begin to analyze in what way text application 
tools such as word processing software or markup languages condition how we are 
able to produce and reproduce (when digitizing) works, and in what way they 
constitute statements on possible DAs, as well as how the tools will affect e.g. 
literary genres and the social organizing of literary life. </p>
<p>In developing (general) markup languages and their DTDs, markup specialists 
are now, in a sense, aiming for the disclosure of the inherent essence of texts 
and documents. In order to be able to adequately handle possible future document 
production and architectures, it is of utmost importance in LIS education and 
research to closely follow these attempts and perhaps also to be part of 
them.</p>
<h2><a name=technology>Document architecture as an object of inquiry into 
information technology</a></h2>
<p>The use of traditional IR systems tends to place modern technology as a 
barrier to products of another technology. Modern technology is treated as a 
mere tool for retrieving representations of information residing in a framework 
of print technology. This may be the most fruitful way of interacting with 
information systems in everyday practice. However, this apprehension may be of 
less use when learning modern information technology as such.</p>
<p><i>Mastering</i> information technology, for example word processing, is not 
the same as to have an <i>understanding</i> of it. It is possible to learn word 
processing and in the process acquiring no or little understanding of how 
technology makes word processing possible. This results in problems in some 
cases, as in the exchange of documents between two subsequential versions of the 
same word processing software or when changing to another word processing 
software. The transition from Wordperfect to MS Word has for most users not been 
an easy one, even though there are apparent underlying similarities between 
their respective architectures. It is an interesting question to ask, <i>why</i> 
mastering the techniques of particular software and hardware solutions isn't 
enough and <i>if</i> it really isn't. We do not believe that it is, and the 
answer may be approached from different perspectives.</p>
<p>One of the reasons is the fact that modern information and communication 
technology conceals a course of events that takes place in the performance of 
certain tasks. Hidden under sophisticated and supposedly user-friendly 
interfaces are rather primitive but numerous events. It would be possible to say 
that this essence in modern technology tends to alienate its users, as was a 
frequent argument during the 60s and 70s, when computers came to be symbols for 
"big brother" <a href="#NOT13">(13)</a>. Be that an 
exaggeration or not, in the context of education this nature of concealment is 
certainly problematic. </p>
<p>If Bruner's statement that "the heart of the education process consists of 
providing aids and dialogues for translating experience into more powerful 
systems of notation and ordering" (<a 
href="#Bruner">Bruner</a>, 1966, p. 21) is worth 
considering, and we believe it is, then a major task will be to unveil the 
concealed courses of events in a way that facilitates the experience of 
technological foundations. The reason for the student's difficulties to 
understand concepts such as <i>file</i>, <i>server</i> or <i>network</i> may be 
that they, essentially, are elaborated abstractions. Consequently all those 
terms turn out as abstractions of unexperienced phenomena. Then the teacher 
finds him- or herself in a position where s/he has to tell beautiful stories the 
student hopefully will believe and remember, and/or instruct the student on how 
to perform a discrete and purely instrumental task. </p>
<p>There is no true magic inherent in technology. It's just that all hardware 
and software are built on a great amount of concealed abstractions. Several of 
these abstractions are founded on different theories on the nature of language 
and knowledge, as many investigations show.<a 
href="#NOT14">(14)</a> Is it possible that if the 
underlying assumptions of for example representation techniques could be 
experienced and studied in a situated task, a thorough understanding would 
become possible? </p>
<p>Word processing is a common task that every student is expected to carry out. 
Problems with student's motivations and lack of interest in learning word 
processing, so often observed in other courses, are often absent. There is 
simply an obvious relation to necessary tasks. Word processing as a means to 
technology education should therefore seem like a good starting point for 
understanding technology. However, it is a fact that problems encountered during 
these tasks are proprietary to particular products. Even though several tasks in 
for example MS Word will be performed similarly to those in other word 
processors, they are seldom identical. The task of text alignment or line break 
in general can not be learned by the use of one word processing application 
alone. Another example is the insertion of in-line images, which can be done in 
several ways, described by software designers in ambiguous dialog boxes of the 
interface. How is the first-time user expected to recognize the difference and 
its consequential meanings between <i>storing</i> the image in the document as 
opposed to <i>linking</i> to an image, when both ways seem to produce the same 
effect? Technology and the solution of tasks tend to stay intimately 
intertwined, which makes it almost impossible to decontextualize problem solving 
and make way for learning, or with the words of Bruner again, technology hinders 
"independence of response from the immediate nature of the stimulus". (<a 
href="#Bruner">Bruner</a>, 1966, p. 5)</p>
<p>A study of explicit DAs in relation to a task like this one would possibly be 
a remedy to this restrained growth. As mentioned in the beginning of this 
article, DA deals with "rules for the formulation of text processing 
application", but rules are not amenable nor explicit in the context of word 
processing applications. Such rules are in fact found among the general markup 
languages (GML) like SGML, XML and HTML, where technology may be stripped bare 
of its sophisticated interfaces. </p>
<p>GML reveals a lot more of what is going on "inside". Users frequently delight 
in seeing that a simple string of short text may cause an in-line image to 
appear in the text, or to see that another string ties an object to a different 
web site by a blue underlining. The same applies to changes made in a separate 
style sheet that may affect the colour and font of all first headings in a large 
complex web site. This is like <i>playing</i> with technology, not just using it 
as <i>a means to an end</i>.<a 
href="#NOT15">(15)</a> </p>
<h2><a name=implementation>The need for DA implementation</a></h2>
<p>There are numerous practices within LIS education and research where DA 
studies might prove to be an essential tool for gaining knowledge. A few 
instances have been addressed in this article, but our scope might of course be 
broadened to even further areas of LIS, for instance: a) the ever growing need 
for quality aspects and critical analyses of web contents and forms, and b) the 
overwhelming, new situation in digital environments, where the malleable screen 
presentation form of an object is separated from its storage form, in which two 
cases an understanding of the fundamental DA is crucial. But the study of DA 
should not be conceived of as a sub-discipline of electronic textuality solely. 
Extending this study to objects of earlier technologies may be revealing for the 
history of writing as a whole. The introduction of the title page may for 
example reflect important historical circumstances or changes in the 
technologies and the infrastructures of that time. Moreover, a thorough 
understanding of how different elements in different document types play 
particular roles, may serve in the work of cataloguing.</p>
<p>A large number of traditional institutions and systems in library 
environments are encountering obstacles in the digital world on account of their 
being essentially print-based. The established systems can be "bent" to 
accommodate the qualities of digital documents - or the other way around. The 
obstacles can thus temporarily be by-passed through ad hoc-arrangements, but 
will not be adequately handled, unless solutions and theories are generated on 
the basis of thorough understanding and analysis of the architectural essence of 
documents in general and, in the examples stated, of web environments and 
digital objects in particular. This makes way for an architectural understanding 
of <i>different</i> kinds of media, structures and meta-objects. LIS education 
and research ought therefore implement the field of DA in order to perform 
necessary investigations of existing and future developments of documents and 
meta-objects. Students would be better prepared. LIS itself would be better 
prepared.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><a name=not1>(1)</a> The term <i>meta-object</i> is borrowed from William <a 
href="#Arms">Arms</a> (1997) and his colleagues' 
description of an "architecture for information in digital libraries". The term 
is for our part meant to indicate that many objects that serve as pointers to 
library material are not really bibliographic.</p>
<p><a name=not2>(2)</a> The term <i>media chauvinism</i> has been borrowed from 
Espen <a href="#Aarseth">Aarseth</a> (1997).</p>
<p><a name=not3>(3)</a>The reassessment needed pertains, of course, largely to 
the challenged concept of <i>document</i>, a concept “rooted in hundreds of 
years of tradition, planted firmly in enormous and complex systems for 
publishing, organization, and access. Yet it has become increasingly evident 
that the archetypal concept of ‘document’ as ‘book’ underlying these systems is 
insufficient to deal with a multitude of media formats, particularly diverse 
electronic formats (...)”. (<a 
href="#Schamber">Schamber</a>, 1996, p. 669). A 
retrospective survey of the difficulties involved in defining the concept of 
document is presented by <a 
href="#Buckland">Buckland</a> (1997).</p>
<p><a name=not4>(4)</a> It may be important to point out that even though the 
SGML standard dates back to 1986, work on markup languages based on separation 
of content and presentation dates back to the late 1960s, according to one of 
SGML's developer's, Charles <a 
href="#Goldfarb">Goldfarb</a> (1998).</p>
<p><a name=not5>(5)</a> Daniel <a 
href="#Chandler">Chandler</a> (1995) attempts a 
thorough description and classification of writing strategies, where his 
"architectural strategy" is most akin to that implied by general markup 
languages.</p>
<p><a name=not6>(6)</a> What has been said about meta-objects may also apply to 
this now widely used, at times even misused , term. Meta-objects <i>contain</i> 
metadata, but <i>are</i> not always bibliographic data.</p>
<p><a name=not7>(7)</a> An attribution possible in using several search engines, 
e.g. <i>Alta Vista</i> and <i>Infoseek</i>.</p>
<p><a name=not8>(8)</a> Of course, metaphors such as these are necessary 
elements of the architecture, as - along with navigation systems, indexing etc - 
"the glue that holds together a web site". (<a 
href="#Rosenfeld">Rosenfeld &amp; Morville</a>, 
1998, s. 11) </p>
<p><a name=not9>(9)</a> That is: the attribution to the linguistic elements of a 
text with structural (and perhaps also presentationally intended) 
metainformation contained in "tags".</p>
<p><a name=not10>(10)</a> A notable example of such a work within the humanistic 
disciplines is the TEI, <i>Text Encoding Initiative</i>, resulting in a 
particularly elaborate DTD (as well as a more manageable "light" version, the 
TEI Lite) (<a href="#Burnard">Sperberg-McQueen &amp; 
Burnard</a>, 1994).</p>
<p><a name=not11>(11)</a> A task that might prove to be difficult indeed. When 
digitizing paper-bound works and their textual manifestations, we frequently 
have difficulty identifying, explaining, and explicitly tagging a great number 
of features in such works, as we have grown so accustomed to them that they have 
become more or less transparent.</p>
<p><a name=not12>(12)</a> For instance printed drama, see <a 
href="#Huitfeldt">Huitfeldt</a> (1999).</p>
<p><a name=not13>(13)</a> At another end of this chain is the practice of 
commercial software producers to "protect" from the user some patented layers of 
manipulation, thereby, in a sense, rendering the user impotent. This practice 
has been analyzed and criticized by e.g. literary theorists such as Friedrich <a 
href="#Kittler">Kittler</a> (1994).</p>
<p><a name=not14>(14)</a> See for example <a 
href="#Coyne">Richard Coyne</a>'s (1995) thorough 
exposé on the theoretical foundations for computational design or the works of 
Joseph <a href="#Weizenbaum">Weizenbaum</a> (1984), 
Terry Winograd and Fernando Flores (<a 
href="#Winograd">Winograd &amp; Flores</a>, 
1986).</p>
<p><a name=not15>(15)</a> Which, peculiarly enough is something that's not 
allowed in some of our public libraries, where actions taken by the help of 
computers must be good for something else or, as they put it, a task of 
searching.</p>

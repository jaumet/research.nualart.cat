<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>The undergraduate programme</h3>

<p>Up to 1998 the only LIS programme in Croatia leading to the Bachelor’s degree was organised at the Department of Information Sciences, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Zagreb <a href="#1">(1)</a>. In spite of its restrictive name the Faculty of Philosophy offers programmes for students of the humanities and a number of social sciences disciplines and with its 5.500 students is in fact a small university in
itself. LIS studies were first introduced in 1976 as a two-year basic professional
programme offered to the students enrolled in another major programme at any faculty in
Croatia. Ten years later, in 1986, a new four-year programme of information sciences was
introduced for students of librarianship, archival studies, museum studies, and
information science. Courses offered in the first two years were obligatory for all
students, and in the third year students had to opt for a stream of their choice. In other
words it was only in their third year that students decided whether they were going to
take librarianship, archival, museum or information science group of subjects. </p>


<p>The librarianship programme offered traditional core subjects, such as
library management, bibliographic organisation and control, classification and subject
indexing, information sources and services and history of libraries, and a number of
electives, such as sociology of the book and reading, introduction to thesauri, slavic
paleography, special or public or school libraries, etc. In the beginning of the nineties
a revised four-year programme for students of librarianship, archival studies, museum
studies and information science was submitted to the educational authorities. The
programme was made up of four separate programmes for four distinctive streams taught at
the department. However, a number of subjects was to be taken by students of all four
streams. The referees who evaluated the programme were nominated by the educational
authorities. In their report they emphasized the importance of LIS studies, but their
appraisal of the museum studies and archival studies programmes was not quite favourable.
A heated debate among the faculty followed. In the meantime we have all become aware of
the tremendous changes introduced by the new information and telecommunication technology
and the new opportunities the technology offers to educational institutions. Therefore we
decided to take into consideration all external changes taking place in the education
field and make a thorough revision of all our programmes. The revised programme was
submitted to the authorities in the early summer of 1999 and we have been expecting their
response.</p>


<h3>The postgraduate programme</h3>

<p>A two-year postgraduate programme leading to an academic master’s
degree was first introduced in 1993 and opened to students who had graduated in LIS, but
also to applicants without degrees in LIS sciences. These applicants must be employed in a
library or have some practical experience in it, and prior to admittance are required to
pass an entrance examination. The aim of the postgraduate programme is to prepare students
for research in the LIS field. A number of library directors and heads of library
departments were among the first candidates enrolled in this programme. </p>


<h3>The doctoral programme</h4>

<p>Although there is no doctoral programme offered at present, it is
possible to submit and defend a dissertation. Doctoral degree is considered to be the
highest academic degree and top managers in libraries are most likely to have it. It is
normally required for university teachers as well. The university authorities have
recently decided that doctoral programme must be a component part of postgraduate
programme. Thus, students who finish their two-year postgraduate studies and earn their
master’s degree, will be able, but not obliged, to continue their studies for one more
year and submit their dissertation.</p>

<h2>Factors affecting curriculum review</h3>

<p>At present the faculty of the Department of Information Sciences are
confronted with a number of questions and dilemmas. It is quite obvious that the
curriculum has to be changed and adapted to new needs. We have been avid readers of new
Council of Europe documents regarding the information society and the changes it brings
about. New professional profiles and new competencies required to perform new jobs are
well-understood (<a href="#ref1">Council of Europe</a>, 1998c). But the real environment in which our students
come to live and work has not yet much changed. Libraries are still struggling with
automation of basic library functions, relying mainly on the home-made computer
applications. A number of public, academic and school libraries have not yet been touched
by automation. Electronic publications are scarce and libraries have not yet started
processing them like other library materials. Librarians are not autonomous in the
selection of library materials, because of the state policy of subsidising publishers by
selecting the titles and buying them for libraries. Financial constraints are great and it
is difficult for libraries to buy equipment, train staff and acquire materials.
Librarians’ salaries are low and at present no trade union takes proper care of them.
The reorganisation of a number of public libraries which at present function as
departments of Public Universities or Houses of Culture but which, according to the Law on
Libraries enacted in 1997, have to become independent institutions is still pending. The
internal reorganisation of many large libraries, the National and University Library in
Zagreb included, is expected to improve the number and quality of the services offered to
users.</p>

<h2>Reasons for the introduction of a new course</h2>


<p>The present situation in libraries makes a great impact on our
students. For quite some time now we have been aware that our students, although some of
them have gradually advanced to posts of library directors or heads of departments, have
difficulties in instigating changes to the traditional practice in libraries. There is no
doubt that some of our students have succeeded in improving their working environment. But
we have also noticed the counter influence that traditional library environment makes upon
a number of our students. Once they get the job in a library many of them seem not only to
adapt themselves quickly to the poor conditions, but they also accept without questioning
the practice set in the library, which has not always been harmonised with professional
standards they learn about during their studies. Since I have been teaching cataloguing
standards I know how much care I put into the interpretation of the standards and
establishing the rationale for them. But during my occasional visits to libraries and
talks with my former students I came to realise how difficult it is to make a real change.
I also understood that something important must have been missing from my lectures. I told
my students what they had to do and why; I did not tell them <i>how</i> they could
implement what they had learned in the surroundings they had to live and work in.</p>

<p>The idea that a new course in the curriculum, which would include the
basics of library legislation and professional ethics, might be useful to students and
make them more aware of their rights and responsibilities as well as of the rights and
responsibilities of their users, occurred to me some time ago. The real impetus came two
years ago from a student who prepared her final thesis. In the thesis she described
automated book lending system used in a public library network in Zagreb. In her paper the
student enclosed a facsimile of a list of borrowers and the titles they borrowed. The list
contained names of real users along with the book titles they borrowed, and the notes
about the overdue books and fines they had to pay. I expressed my wonder that the student
was allowed to copy such a document. Then I realised that she did not quite understand my
reproach. The idea that data about the books one reads might belong to a sphere of privacy
and should be protected never occurred to her. I realised that it was not enough to impart
technical knowledge and that it takes more to make a professional <a href="#2">(2)</a>.</p>


<h2>Courses on library ethics in the curricula of the nineties</h2>


<p>The issue of users' privacy belongs to the professional ethics domain.
In the early nineties, when we were discussing our present curriculum, a number of library
schools offered a separate course on library ethics. Our departmental library still keeps
several printed booklets issued in the beginning of the nineties by LIS schools. A course
entitled <i>Information ethics</i> was taught at the <a href="#ref3">University of Maryland College of
Library and Information Services</a> (1992). The <a href="#ref3">University of New South Wales Faculty of
Professional Studies</a> (1992?) offered the course of the same name. In some schools, however,
professional ethics was taught as a part of a broader course. For instance, the School of
Library and Information Science of the Catholic University of America offered to its
students a course on <i><a href="#ref1">Libraries and information in society</a></i> (1992). The short
description of the course included a discussion of the role of library and information
professionals and institutions in the past and present, discussion of standards governing
ethical professional conduct, exploration of the various aspects of access to information,
and discussion of funding patterns. An interesting course was offered by the University of
Toronto Faculty of Library and Information Science to its PhD students. The course
entitled <i>The Library in the Political Process</i> included an investigation of the
nature and importance of political forces in the governance of libraries and in the
behaviour of librarians, and an examination of the activities of various pressure groups,
such as library associations, book publishers and book sellers (<a href="#ref3">University of Toronto</a>,
1990; 26). </p>



<p>In the beginning of the nineties, however, legal and ethical issues
related to the library environment in Croatia were regarded as supplementary to the core
and they were incorporated in the course in library management. It should be added here
that it was only in 1992 that the Croatian Library Association adopted its first Code of
Ethics (<a href="#ref1">Croatian Library Association</a>, 1992)</p>


<h2>A course in Library legislation and standards</h2>


<p>Since at the time when I first started thinking about the new course,
the reshaping of the curriculum was out of question, I used the opportunity allowed to the
faculty to introduce a new course. In order to do this I had to give up teaching one of my
previous courses, because the total number of hours approved for the whole programme had
to be respected. The course could not consist of more than 30 hours in order to be
considered ‘a slight change’ to the curriculum, for which no special administrative
procedure is required apart from the agreement of the faculty. I had to write an outline
of the proposed course and explain its aim. A random search of the LIS schools' curricula
on the Internet revealed that a number of schools had introduced at least one course
related to societal and/or legal aspects of information. (<a href="#ref1">Catholic University of America</a>,
1999; <a href="#ref1">City University London</a>, 1999; <a href="#ref3">Université Libre de Bruxelles</a>, 1999; <a href="#ref3">University of
Central England</a>, 1999; <a href="#ref3">University of Loughborough</a>, 1999; <a href="#ref3">University of Sheffield</a>, 1999;
<a href="#ref3">University of Toronto</a>, 1999). The titles of courses such as <i>Libraries and information
in the society</i>,<i> Information systems and the information society</i>,<i> Libraries,
information and society</i>, <i>Information and its social contexts</i>, <i>Media law</i>,
<i>Legal and</i> <i>professional issues</i> point to the relation between the LIS field
and its wider environment. The content of the courses normally includes elements of
professional ethics, but the courses typically cover a wide range of societal and legal
issues relevant to library and information institutions and professionals. </p>


<p>The Internet search encouraged me to broaden the scope of the new
course and make it cover a variety of relatively recent issues relevant for the LIS field.
I chose the name <i>Library legislation and standards</i>. First I wanted the students to
become aware of the fact that apart from the <i>Law on Libraries</i> (1997) there are
other laws and legal regulations which shape the library environment. I wanted to make
them attentive to any part of legislation related to libraries in any possible way. I also
wanted to introduce to them a few relevant documents adopted by various international
bodies. My main aim was to try to induce students to think about the role of libraries in
a larger context and appraise critically library legislation and standards.</p>

<h2>Structure of the course</h2>

<p>I decided to structure the course as a series of seven sessions of four
hours each. Two hours in each session would be used for lectures and another two hours for
students’ presentations of assignments. Each of the seven sessions was to be centred on
one topic. A lecture would start with relevant international documents covering the topic,
followed by a description of the institutional practice abroad and then the Croatian
Constitution and the respective national law(s) would be interpreted as well as the
national practice. Assignments would be given to students to investigate particular issues
and they would be required to have 10-15 minutes presentations in the classroom.</p>

<p>The seven sessions would cover the following topics, not necessarily in
this order.</p>

<h3>1. Organisation of libraries, their mission and functions as presented
in legislation and internal library regulations</h3>

<p>In this session the relevant text describing international trends is <i><a href="#ref2">UNESCO
Manifesto for Public Libraries</a></i> (1994). The emphasis is on need to organise services
for various categories of users, including blind and physically impaired people,
prisoners, hospital patients, people living in isolated rural areas, as well as ethnic
minorities. Students have to find out how the new <i><a href="#ref1">Law on Libraries</a></i> of
Croatia (1997) deals with this issue. Council of Europe <i><a href="#ref1">Recommendation on Library
legislation in Europe</a></i> (1999) is presented as another document of potential
significance for all European libraries. Since the <i>Recommendation</i> covers a number
of topics that are discussed in other sessions, such as copyright, freedom of access to
information, etc., it is referred to in other sessions as well. M. Ryynänen's report on
the <i><a href="#ref2">Role of libraries in the modern world</a></i> (1998), that gave impetus to the drafting
of the Recommendation is also mentioned. The <i><a href="#ref2">Law on High Education</a></i> (1993) and the <i><a href="#ref2">Law on Scientific Research</a></i> (1993) contain stipulations on libraries and librarians that are discussed. Available library statutes and rules of proceeding are examined and
interpreted in order to find out how libraries serve the public. Lack of written selection
policies in libraries is pointed out.</p>

<h3>2. Freedom of expression and freedom of access to information in
libraries and archives </h3>


<p><i><a href="#ref3">UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a></i> (1948) and <i><a href="#ref2">European
Convention on Human Rights</a></i> (1950)>are the two principal international documents
students have to know about. The articles of the <i><a href="#ref1">Constitution of the Republic of
Croatia</a></i> (1991), which guarantee freedom of expression, freedom of press and other
means of communication and freedom of speech, are interpreted. The abstract issue of human
rights must be connected to the specific library world. An assignment is given to a
student to trace in what form these rights are introduced in the Library Law. The <i><a href="#ref1">Croatian
Library Association Statute</a></i> (1992)and its <i><a href="#ref1">Code of Ethics</a></i>
(1992) are introduced as texts relevant to the profession. They are compared to codes of
conduct of other professions and/or other library associations. The work of IFLA/FAIFE
(1999) in this field is described.</p>


<h3>3. Freedom of expression and freedom of access to information in the
digital world</h3>

<p>Are the rules on freedom of expression in the book world applicable to
the digital world? Excerpts from a report prepared for the Council of Europe (1998b) on
freedom of expression and public access points are used for discussion. The use of filters
on the Internet is explained and discussed. The local situation is investigated. The state
<i><a href="#ref1">Regulation on the Foundation of the Croatian Academic and Research Network (CARNet)</a></i>
(1995) is presented to students. The lack of national legislation covering digital world
is discussed. An assignment is given to a student to find the <i><a href="#ref1">CARNet Rules of
conduct</a></i> (1995) on Internet. Netiquette guidelines as an informal standard of behaving
on the network is a good enticement to discuss the style of written messages, indicate
differences between style of written letters and e-mail messages, and emphasise ethical
issues related to the communication in the digital world. </p>

<h3>4. Censorship</h3>

<p>The <i><a href="#ref1">Constitution of the Republic of Croatia</a></i> (1991) and
the <i><a href="#ref2">Law on Public Communication</a></i> (1996) are both relevant to the issue of freedom of
expression and can be good starting points to discuss censorship. Censorship in libraries
has a long history and in this course only those aspects of it which are relevant to
present-day libraries are dealt with. Recommended literature includes works of <a href="#ref2">Rauch</a>
(1993) and <a href="#ref2">Malley</a> (1993).</p>


<h3>5. Privacy </h3>

<p>Privacy as a constitutional right is discussed. It is pointed out that
the right to privacy is confirmed in the <i><a href="#ref1">European Convention on Human Rights</a></i>. The
<a href="#ref1">Council of Europe</a> (1981) <i>Convention concerning protection of individuals with regard to
automatic processing of personal data</i> and the EU <i><a href="#ref1">Directive on the protection of
personal data </a></i>(1998) are mentioned. The national <i><a href="#ref2">Law on protection of confidential
data</a></i> (1996) is interpreted. Professional, state and military secret is defined as it
appears in the national legislation. The treatment of personal data kept in government
databases, databases of large firms, and archives although not directly connected to
libraries are considered important and explained. Selected excerpts from works of <a href="#ref2">McLeod
&amp; Cooling</a> (1990) and <a href="#ref2">Marett</a> (1991) are offered to students who have to prepare their assignments.</p>



<h3>6. Copyright </h3>

<p>Protection of authors’ works guaranteed in the Constitution is another topic for discussion. International conventions like <i>Berne Convention</i> and <i>Universal Convention</i> are introduced and the relevant articles of the Croatian<i> Copyright Law</i>
(1998) presented. The concept of lending right, not known in Croatia, is explained.
Possible reasons for limiting photocopying in libraries are put forward. The rights of
producers and reproductive artists are interpreted because they are relevant for public
libraries, which hold collections of sound recordings. The need to establish a balance
between author’s rights to remuneration and users’ right to free access is emphasised.
Selected chapters from Marett (1991) are used in preparing the lecture.</p>


<h3>7. Protection of cultural heritage</h3>

<p>The fact that libraries hold a part of the country’s cultural
heritage is explained. The activities and some documents of the <a href="#ref1">Council of Europe</a> (1998a)
in this field are outlined. Legal deposit is shown to be a means to protect the written
heritage. Problems related to the legal deposit of electronic materials are discussed.
Relevant parts of the <i>Law on Libraries </i>are examined. <i><a href="#ref2">Law on protection and
preservation of cultural heritage</a></i> (1999) and various professional texts on
preservation and conservation in libraries and archives are examined and interpreted.
Relevant parts of the <i><a href="#ref1">Criminal Law</a></i> (1997) concerning illegal export of cultural
heritage are interpreted.</p>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>


<p>It should be kept in mind that a number of issues dealt with in this
course are by no means new to students. Issues like organisation of libraries, legal
deposit or preservation of cultural heritage appear as topics in other courses as well. In
this course, however, technical aspects have intentionally been put aside and legal and
ethical aspects only have been considered. The intention has been to make students aware
of the existence of international documents of relevance to the library community and to
show how the international trends and attitudes have been followed at the national level.
The existence or lack of adequate national legislation has been investigated and possible
differences in the international and national treatment of particular issues explained.
Ethical aspects have also been underlined. It is hoped that the course might help students
to improve their understanding of the legal context in which they are going to work and
teach them to appreciate the importance of good legislation. It is also hoped that
students will be able to recognise basic moral principles of the profession and could rely

<p></sup></font><font size="2">(1) <a name="1"></a>In 1998 a new programme
for librarians was established at the Faculty of Pedagogy, University of Osijek. The
programme is a slightly revised four-year programme offered by the Department of
Information Sciences in Zagreb and the Zagreb faculty travel to Osijek to teach.</p>
<sup>

<p></sup><font size="2"><a name="2"></a>(2) It is only fair to add here that some twenty years ago when I
started working as a librarian in the National and University Library in Zagreb, I learned
from my superiors that the titles of books one reads were not to be revealed to another
user. Why this important part of professional ethics has been forgotten, remains to be
explained.</font><font size="3"></p>

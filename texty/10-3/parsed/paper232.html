<h2>Introduction</h2>
  
<p>Personal information management is 'the practice of managing the information that helps us in our daily lives' (<a href="#bel00">Bellotti &amp; <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> 2000</a>: 227). One of the key activities of personal information management is retaining information for later access and use. Individuals keep information because they think that it will be useful at a <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>time and they will therefore need to find it again. Individuals keep information in a personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and they base their keeping behaviour on personal, anticipated information need.</p>

<h2>Personal information collections</h2>

<p>In our complex world, the fundamental importance of information in our daily lives is widely acknowledged. People regularly encounter and have access to far more information than they can possibly process. It is common to <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of a <em>glut of information</em> and of <em>information overload</em>. There is a lot of information available and by many measures the amount continues to grow at an exponential pace. Information plays a significant role in our daily professional and personal lives and we are constantly challenged to take <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information that we need for work, fun and everyday decisions and tasks. In <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to this challenge, individuals create a personalized subset of <em>the information world</em> that they can use when they are faced with information needs. This subset of the information world is a personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>refers broadly to a personal organization of and <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on information. This includes content in various forms (documents, Web pages, mail, notes, calendars, address books, etc.), structures for representing and organizing this information (folder hierarchies, piles, lists, etc.), and pointers to information (people, <span>links</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> favourites, etc.). </p>

<p>The concept of a personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is not new to the information field (<a href="#bov96">Bovey 1996</a>). The numerous models that have been developed over time to describe the behaviour of information seeking and use (see <a href="#wil00">Wilson 2000</a>, for examples) follow the user with an information need through the processes of seeking information in external sources to the goal of achieving understanding and <span>action</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Most of these models also acknowledge the preference of individuals to seek information internally first&#8212;in other words, from a personal store of information sources and channels. It is generally assumed that the user resorts to searching external sources when he or she has <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that the information needed is not more immediately at hand. This preference has been implicitly acknowledged for some time. When Bush (<a href="#bus45">1945</a>) first <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>his notion of a MEMEX, for example, he was describing the development of a 'mechanized private file and library' where 'an individual stores all his books, records, and communications &#8230; an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory' (<a href="#bus45">Bush 1945</a>: section 6). Bush was describing a vision for a personal <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information that an individual could access whenever need arose.</p>

 <p>More recently, the concept of a personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>has been described using terms such as personal information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#kwa91">Kwasnik 1991</a>; <a href="#mal83">Malone 1983</a>) and information space (<a href="#mck00">McKnight 2000</a>). Bates has described the inclination of individuals to carve out a subset of the information world in a personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>through the metaphor of farming (<a href="#bat01">Bates 2001</a>). In Bates's metaphor, people <em>farm</em> information because they want to reduce the effort of information seeking. Bates points out that collecting information sources and channels is analogous to farming because we <em>tend</em> the <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by organizing its materials for later use. </p>

<p>A personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is defined, therefore, as the space we turn to first when we need information to do a task or pursue an interest. It is a <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information sources and channels that we as individuals have <span>acquired</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> cultivated, and organized over time and in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of stimuli. The personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is an organic and dynamic personal construct that we take with us into, and out of, the various information events that frame our daily working and personal lives. </p>
  
<p>Building a personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>arises out of everyday information events, which <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>when an individual makes contact with an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel. This contact may be the result of purposeful information seeking, incidental or <span>accidental</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>information encountering, or being given information by another <span>person</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Whenever an individual locates, encounters or is given an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel, he or she faces the decision of whether to include this information in his or her personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#jon04">Jones 2004</a>). The choices made in the act of keeping the information and the reasons for doing so may vary greatly but the <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>choices remain the same: 1) to keep the information; 2) to leave the information where it is (it is useful but I can find it when I need it); or 3) to ignore the information (it is not useful and it is not likely to be useful at any time in the future). </p>
  
<p>The personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is, therefore, a subset of the information world that an individual has built conceptually and physically over time. The personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>includes information sources and channels that an individual has <em>kept</em> and those that the individual has identified as useful but that are in a space or place that can be located again <span>easily</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>'Keeping' entails interventions by the individual to acquire, <span>represent</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> organize, store, and remember the location of, information sources and channels in the personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> These interventions <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>investments of time and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>effort by the individual which he or she will <span>calculate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>against the benefits of time saved and improvements to task completion or decision making&#8212;of having the right information at hand at the right time. The personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>also includes information sources and channels that the individual locates or encounters and then makes a conscious decision to leave <em>in situ</em> ('leaving'). The individual makes this decision knowing that he or she will be able to find this information again in the place where it was originally located or encountered. There is no need in this case for investments in keeping interventions by the individual but there will be some investment of <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>effort in the valuation of the potential benefit of access to the information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel. Information sources and channels that are <em>left</em> according to this valuation are, therefore, (conceptually) components of the personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>regularly used Website is one example of a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that an individual might choose to <em>leave</em> (because he or she can find it later) rather than <em>keep</em>.</p>
  
<p>We have known for some time that individuals engage in valuations of their investment in various forms of information behaviour. Research by Poole (<a href="#poo85">1985</a>), for example, identified <em>least effort</em> as the principle <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>a set of conclusions that he compiled from seventy-nine studies of information seeking and use. When he explored the principle of least effort further he uncovered Zipf's (<a href="#zip49">1949</a>) early work acknowledging that individuals make long-term decisions about what activities will <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the least effort. Zipf's work also reveals that individuals often do not know what their <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>problems will be, or how work expenditure in the present moment will affect those problems. The individual, therefore, estimates his or her <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and determines which course of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>will likely lead to the least average rate of work. For Zipf, then, <em>least effort</em> described the 'least average rate of probable work' (<a href="#zip49">Zipf 1949</a>: 6). With this in mind, we can see that the creation and maintainance of a personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is a process occurring over time with the individual calculating and valuing the costs and benefits of keeping behaviour.</p>
  
<p>The 'keeping' and 'leaving' decisions that are associated with the creation of a personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>can also be described in terms of signal detection theory (<a href="#pet54">Peterson<em>et al.</em> 1954</a>; <a href="#van54">Van Meter and Middleton 1954</a>). When an individual creates a personal information <span>collection</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> he or she is attempting to keep (or at least to insure the availability of) useful information (a hit) and to ignore useless information (a correct rejection). Mistakes are inevitable, however. For example, people sometimes keep information that turns out to be useless &#8211; a <span>false</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>positive; and they sometimes take no steps to keep information that turns out to be useful &#8211; a miss. Individuals, therefore, adjust their threshold for keeping information to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the relative costs of misses and <span>false</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>positives (and the relative benefits of hits and correct rejections). In situations where the costs of <span>false</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>positives are relatively high, the expectation is that people will be less likely to keep the information in their personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> On the other hand, if misses are relatively more costly, then people will be more inclined to keep the information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel in their personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Some of the implications of applying a signal-detection analysis to the formation of personal information collections are obvious; some less so. For example, people working in professions for which complete and <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>information and good record-keeping are especially important (such as lawyers or doctors) would be <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to have a lower threshold for deciding to keep information. People would also be more likely to decide to keep information in their personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>as the cost of <span>storage</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>decreases. Lower <span>storage</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>costs mean lower costs for a <span>false</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>positive. The same <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>may have many different thresholds depending upon the information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel involved. For example, an office worker might simultaneously be 'upgraded' to a <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with a <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>hard drive and 'downgraded' to a smaller office with less room for paper <span>storage</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> The corresponding cost of a <span>false</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>positive then goes down for electronic information and up for information in paper form. Other variables (such as job role and status) being equal, the office worker may be more inclined than before to keep information in electronic form and less inclined than before to keep information in paper (<a href="#jon04">Jones 2004</a>). </p>
  
<p>As individuals build their personal information <span>collection</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> assessments of information value and the relative costs of <span>false</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>positives and misses may be subject to some distortion. When an individual has information 'in hand', there may be a strong tendency to overvalue its importance or its potential relevance to various projects and to overestimate the costs associated with its absence from the personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> The costs of a <span>false</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>positive&#8211;the costs associated with increasing clutter or the greater likelihood that good information is obscured by the arrival of new information&#8211; are less apparent. The threshold for keeping the information in the personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is then set too low. People are more likely to keep information, even if a high percentage of it is never used, than they are to risk having to look 'from scratch' for information that was previously at hand (<a href="#jon04">Jones 2004</a>). Research by Whittaker and Hirschberg (<a href="#whi01">2001</a>) that <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>people during an office <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>illustrates this point. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>number of this study's participants expressed regret for what Whittaker and Hirschberg called 'premature filing'&#8211;where participants had taken time to organize <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>into folders and had then, later on, <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that this time and effort had not been <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>it. </p>
  
<p>In summary, the ideal of building a personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is that once we find useful information, it will be organized so that it is readily at hand when a later need for it arises. We approach the ideal of a perfect personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>through our ability to <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>useful from non-useful information and to anticipate the usefulness of information in the <span>future</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is that an individual will keep useful information and discard information that is not useful. The expectation is that, if individuals can develop a greater awareness (perception and anticipation) of the <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of their information needing and for the relative importance of different people, projects, areas of interest and their life goals, then they will be better able to <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>between useful and non-useful information sources and channels and to make the critical decisions related to building and maintaining their personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>
  
<p>The information behaviour associated with creating a personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is, therefore based upon the anticipation of information need by the individual, in other words, upon <em>personal, anticipated information need</em>. </p>
  
<h2>Anticipated information need</h2>

<p>Library and information professionals use the concept of anticipated information need when they build and develop information collections for a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of users. One of the first <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>textbooks about <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>development (<a href="#mcc25">McColvin 1925</a>), for example, argued that public libraries exist in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to, and in anticipation of demand; and that it is the responsibility of the library to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to the demands of the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> This should include both <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and potential users of the library. Drury (<a href="#dru30">1930</a>) suggested that the librarian needs to anticipate the needs of potential users. Broadus (<a href="#bro81">1981</a>) also argued that the library should meet both the currently expressed and the ultimate needs of the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and suggested that, in assessing demand, the library make some provision for serving the needs of potential users. </p>

  <p>The professional interventions of cataloguing and indexing are also based on the anticipation of information need. The information professional engages in a conceptual analysis of an information-bearing object with the aim of generating a <span>representation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the object that will connect it with a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of anticipated information needs (<a href="#lan98">Lancaster 1998</a>). The professional, on behalf of the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>served by the library or information agency, represents and organizes the <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>based on assumptions and anticipations. The professional is conjecturing the way the information object will find its use in resolving the information need(s) of a patron or group of patrons. This is called user-oriented indexing (<a href="#fid94">Fidel 1994</a>). The indexer is attempting to <span>map</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the content of the information object to the anticipated requirements of individual users and requests. It is acknowledged that this form of indexing relies on a deep understanding of searching behaviour.
Hj&oslash;rland sums up the information field's <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on anticipating the needs of information users: </p>
  
<blockquote>'because any document can, in principle, provide answers to an infinity of questions, subject <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>should <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>priorities based on the specific user groups served... the subject of a document is thus relative to the aim of the specific information service... the best subject analysis is the one that makes the best prognosis of the <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use of the document' (<a href="#hjo01">Hj&oslash;rland 2001</a>: 776)</blockquote>
  
<p>For some time then, the concept of anticipated information need has been recognized as an underpinning for the interventions and <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of professionals in the information field. To date, this concept has not been examined at the level of the individual user. An elaboration of personal, anticipated information need can, however, be extrapolated from what the field knows
about the concept of information need.</p>
	
<h2>Information need </h2>

<p>Over time, the information field has developed a deepening understanding of the concept of information need and its role in information seeking and use. The view that information need motivates information behaviour is an embedded <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the user-oriented paradigm which focuses upon what people think, do and feel when they seek and use information (see, <a href="#wil81">Wilson, 1981</a>; <a href="#der86">Dervin and Nilan 1986</a>; <a href="#hew90">Hewins 1990</a>; <a href="#pet01">Pettigrew <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>). Observing and generalizing a concept of information need which exists in an individual's head as an inner motivational state is a challenge (<a href="#gru89">Grunig 1989</a>; see <a href="#cas02">Case 2002</a>: 65). We can only infer the nature of information need based on the behaviour that it engenders (information seeking and use), but, over time, information scientists have studied the complexities of this key concept. </p>
  
<p>Taylor (<a href="#tay68">1968</a>) first <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the information field to the view that information need is a personal, <span>psychological</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> sometimes inexpressible, vague and unconscious <span>condition</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> He articulated four levels of information need that an individual passes through before he or she makes formal encounters with an information system or the services of an information professional. These levels are: visceral need, conscious need, formalized need, and compromised need. Taylor's work laid the foundation for a deeper conceptual understanding of the motivations or triggers for information seeking. It was the basis for <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>insights by researchers such as Belkin, Saracevic, Ingwersen, Dervin and Kuhlthau. </p>
  
<p>Belkin <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#bel82">1982</a>), for example, put forth the ASK hypothesis: that individuals are driven to engage in information seeking behaviour by an anomalous state of knowledge. The ASK hypothesis has been <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>conceptually over the years and applied in numerous research studies, particularly in information retrieval research (<a href="#ing99">Ingwersen 1999</a>; <a href="#spi98">Spink <em>et al.</em> 1998</a>; <a href="#vak99">Vakkari 1999</a>). But, the more we know about the underpinning motivation for information seeking and use, the more we appreciate the complexity of the concept of information need. Elaborating Taylor's view of information need, Belkin <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#bel82">1982</a>), for example, stated that 'some situations, even if well <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>at the <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>level, defy <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>at the linguistic level.' Belkin <em>et al.</em> are referring to the individual and idiosyncratic nature of information need. In some situations an individual will recognize an uncertainty or a gap in his or her understanding at the <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>level but will be unable to <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or act on this uncertainty. In the personal information management context, this means that an individual may recognize the <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>need that he or she has for an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel and yet be unable to linguistically elaborate this anticipated need into forms that <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and organize the information into personal files for later re-location and use. </p>

  <p>Belkin's first attempts to understand information need and to embed these insights into the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>have since been developed into what he calls the problem state of the user; that is, what the information system has to know about the user's problem in order to provide information that will help (<a href="#bel84">Belkin 1984</a>). The problem state of the user is a composite of the background of the individual, his or her information need and where he or she is placed in terms of <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>information to meet the need. Belkin proposed that at minimum, an intermediary (human or machine) should be able to build a model of what is motivating the individual's information seeking. This model should include 1) the state of the user in the problem treatment process; 2) the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and type of problem the user is facing; 3) the user's state of knowledge about the problem; 4) the goals, intentions and background of the user; and 5) how best to interact with the user to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>this knowledge (<a href="#bel84">Belkin 1984</a>: 117). Ingwersen (<a href="#ing92">1992</a>) has since <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>Belkin's concept of problem state, renaming it the problem space of the user. Saracevic <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#sar88">1988</a>) also highlighted the complexity of an individual's incentives for information behaviour by stating that there is more to an information need than the words expressing it. Saracevic <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#sar88">1988</a>) formulated what they call the problem orientation, proposing that information provision and information services should <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on serving the problems that trigger information seeking rather than individual <span>expressions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information need. The problem orientation focuses on the <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and internal factors that affect information seeking and retrieving. Saracevic <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#sar88">1988</a>) identify these factors as:</p>

<ol>
<li>the <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the problem by the user; </li>
<li>the individual's <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use of the information; </li>
<li>user's internal knowledge state in respect to the problem; and </li>
<li>the <span>estimation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by the user of the knowledge publicly available to resolve the
  problem (Saracevic <em>et al.</em> 1988: 164).</li>
</ol>

<p>Dervin has also contributed significantly to our understanding of the concept of information need. Dervin (<a href="#der92">1992</a>) describes information needing as an <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#wes97">Westbrook 1997</a>). The patterns of everyday living <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>an individual forward in his or her own space-time continuum, but there are stops in this space-time continuum that are caused by <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>discontinuities&#8212;information needing or gaps. Bridging these gaps in our day-to-day lives <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>information to make sense of the whole. Dervin calls this constructive process of needing and bridging, sensemaking. Her <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on actions and her drawing the <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information field to this <span>phenomenon</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> frame the information behaviour of an individual in micromoments of time and space. Dervin (<a href="#der96">1996</a>) argues for a shift in focus; rather than a <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on the user, the system and their <span>interactions</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> that we should <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>instead on information use. Her view is that information behaviour represents an amalgam of acts of information use by an individual as he or she confronts the micromoments of sensemaking in daily life. </p>
  
<p>Pirolli and Card (<a href="#pir95">1995</a>) and Sandstrom (<a href="#san99">1999</a>, <a href="#san04">2004</a>) have also argued for a shift in the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of studies of information behaviour. Specifically, they recommend a cultural materialist approach based upon optimal foraging theory. Optimal foraging theory, from anthropology and <span>biology</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> focuses on the opportunities, decisions, and adaptation <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of sustenance-seeking <span>animals</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and hunter-gatherers. Pirolli and Card (<a href="#pir95">1995</a>) <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>concept for the study of information behaviour called information foraging, which they define as 'activities associated with assessing, seeking, and handling information sources' (<a href="#pir95">Pirolli &amp; Card 1995</a>: 2). Sandstrom (<a href="#san04">2004</a>), too, calls for a cultural materialist and behavioural ecology approach to studying information behaviour, arguing that individuals in an information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are analogous to hunters and gatherers in a natural <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#san04">Sandstrom 2004</a>: 6). Sandstrom points out that productive scholars rarely undertake large-scale 'hunting' expeditions for information, but prefer to 'gather' information from trusted sources and passive information supply methods, keeping the best information close at hand in what <span>amounts</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to a personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>
  
<h2>The uncertainty principle</h2>

<p>Many of the views expressed above that relate to how individuals process information, learn and make sense of their world also form the underpinning for Kuhlthau's (<a href="#kuh93">1993</a>) uncertainty principle. Kuhlthau claims that uncertainty (including <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>processes and affective con0erations) is the trigger for information seeking and use. The uncertainty principle is based on a theoretical composite that Kuhlthau derives from Dewey, Kelly and Bruner. She uses this composite as an analytical lens for focusing on the constructive processes of information use for thinking, reflection and learning. She also draws <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to the disruptive impact of new information on an individual's system of constructs and the role that <span>inference</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> prediction and interpretation play in information use. Features of the concept of <em>personal, anticipated information need</em> can be <span>introduced</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> therefore, through a <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the six corollaries that comprise the uncertainty principle. </p>
  
<p>The <em>process corollary</em>, for example, identifies the experiences that make up information seeking&#8212;thoughts, actions and feelings&#8212;and which evolve as the process unfolds. This 'complex mosaic' of thoughts actions and feelings may not, however, be exclusively focused on the need or uncertainty that triggered the information-seeking process. An individual's <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>needs (anticipated information needs) are also woven into the thoughts, feelings and actions of the information seeking process. For example, a common experience <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by Jones <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#jon01">2001</a>) is that a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>browsing the Web for one task may encounter information of potential value for other, <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>tasks. There is then a tension between the management of information for the current task and the management of the information of potential value to <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>tasks. At one extreme the <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>may abandon the current task and attend fully to the new information. At the other extreme, the <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>may keep all <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on the current task, perhaps with some confidence that the new information can <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>be found later on; perhaps not. In between these extremes are actions (interventions) such as creating a Bookmark or Favorite or sending the Web address in self-addressed email. These <span>intermediate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>actions can be seen too as an effort to preserve options on potentially useful information at the cost of some, though hopefully small, disruption to the current task. The <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information seeking research has generally been on the processes of satisfying or addressing immediate information needs. Through the concept of <em>personal, anticipated information need</em>, this article is proposing that information seeking behaviour is also effected by <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>tasks and anticipated needs. </p>
  
<p>The <em>formulation corollary</em> highlights the <span>interpretive</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and creative tasks of going beyond the information found or encountered. Clearly, these formulations and alternative <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are individual; related to the unique needs and <span>backgrounds</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of people. Kuhlthau observes that uncertainty may increase at points within the process of formulation, because exploration (the acts of uncovering new information for new constructs which is inherently disruptive) is the key to formulation. But when exploration uncovers information that does not serve the original need or uncertainty, this 'other information' may, in fact, motivate a different type of uncertainty; a vague or ill-defined sense that the information located has a <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>purpose and should be kept for later use. The clarity of the  <em>personal, anticipated information need</em> will affect the levels of tension or anxiety that the new information may arouse. </p>
  
<p>The <em>redundancy corollary</em> identifies the shifting <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of unique and redundant information that <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with the information seeking process. In Kuhlthau's view, too much redundant information causes boredom, but too much new information causes anxiety. As the information seeking process unfolds, the amount of new information encountered will decrease. This in turn increases the confidence and certainty of the information user. The information seeking process may also introduce a subcategory of unique information that will motivate personal information management (keeping) behaviour by the individual. Information located or encountered in the information seeking process may, for example, be admitted into a personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on a provisional 'check-this-out-later' basis and without a definite notion of where it should be kept and to what needs this information might apply. Such admissions can neither be said to increase or decrease the redundancy of information associated with a specific need.</p> 

<p>Information lacking a clear value to a particular need is often placed into 'piles' (<a href="#mal83"> Malone 1983</a>) pending further review. People exhibit creativity in their ways of sorting electronic information into 'check-this-out-later' piles. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>participant <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in a study of Web use conducted by the author and his collaborators (see <a href="#jon02">Jones <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>), for example, placed references to potentially useful but unanalyzed Web information into his <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of Favorites. Web sites of proven value were later transferred to his personal Web site. Another participant <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in this study <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>her <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of Favorites into three <span>regions</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> The top <span>region</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>held references to Web information that was accessed <span>frequently</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> perhaps daily. The middle <span>region</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>organized references to Web information of proven value but less <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>accessed into a hierarchy of folders. The bottom <span>region</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>contained a <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of 'check-this-out-later' references. When the number of these references <span>reached</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>a point where they could no longer all be viewed without scrolling, then the participant had the habit of pruning the <span>list</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> either by deleting or <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>selected references into one of the other <span>regions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in her favorites hierarchy. This evidence suggests that the appropriate <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of redundant to new information in relation to an original information need may lessen anxiety and raise confidence as Kuhlthau's redundancy corollary indicates, but other potentially useful information encountered in the information seeking process may also trigger a set of supplementary anxieties and information behaviour related to personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
  
<p>  It is also important to note a second kind of redundancy: a redundancy in the 'keeping' of information and in the ways in which it can later be re-accessed. In the author's study of Web use, for example, one participant indicated that he might save especially important Web information to his hard drive, create a Favorite referencing the Web site for this information and even email a <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to this Web site to friends and colleagues. By doing so, the participant was creating several alternatives for the <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>re-access of this information.</p>
  
<p>The <em>mood corollary</em> emphasizes the importance of the user's attitude when he or she engages in information seeking. Kuhlthau claims that this attitude will determine an individual's approach to the information <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>process. For this corollary, she <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to Kelly's identification of two moods that characterize a constructive process. Kelly's invitational mood is associated with expansive actions. The indicative mood is associated with conclusive actions. Kuhlthau relates expansive and conclusive actions to her model of the information <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>process. Personal information management involves a set of conclusive actions resulting from an indicative mood. This is true when the individual is able to recognize and articulate his or her likely <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>need for an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel. In this case, the conclusive actions are the interventions by the individual that relate to building the personal information <span>collection</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> that is: 'keeping' and 'leaving'. But, as the preceding discussion of the concept of information need indicated, a personal, anticipated information need may be visceral and inexpressible. Where this is the case, the mood of the individual would likely be invitational.  'Keeping' would be expansive: 'check-this-out-later' stacks are an example of invitational information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>may <span>ultimately</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>process (to the point of at least assessing usefulness for a specific need) only a percentage of items in such a stack. The percentage of items that is <span>eventually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>determined to be useful may be smaller still. The individual finds it difficult to relate the anticipated need for information to any existing schema in the personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> The information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel may be stored in multiple locations in the personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or in vaguely defined organizational categories such as a miscellaneous folder.</p>
  
<p>The<em> prediction corollary</em> stresses that the information <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>process is a series of <span>predictions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and choices which define and extend an individual's system of constructs in relation to the information being <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and to the information located. When an individual decides to <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>information found or encountered into his or her personal information <span>collection</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> a set of choices and <span>predictions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are also made. These <span>predictions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are based on the individual's <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to anticipate the way this new information will be used and to choose where and how the information should be stored in the personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>based on these <span>predictions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and existing organizational structures. Prediction and choosing are, in fact, fundamental components of  <em>personal, anticipated information need</em> and the information behaviour that relates to building a personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Research by Kwasnik (<a href="#kwa91">1991</a>), for example, reports that the <span>predicted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>future use of a document is as significant to an individual as the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or form of the document when it comes to making decisions about how to organize a personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>
  
<p>With the <em>interest corollary</em> Kuhlthau emphasizes the increase in interest that <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in the later stages of the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>process as uncertainty declines. Interest is also a key factor in determining the approach that an individual will use for information processing. Similarly, the information behaviour that relates to building a personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>reflects different levels of interest and commitment. Building a personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(carving out a personal subset of the 'information world') is a form of self preservation. The individual engages in this information behaviour in an effort to head off <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>problems or to plan for foreseen issues that will <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>selected information sources or channels. Higher levels of personal interest are more likely to trigger specific, well defined and clearly <span>differentiated</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>anticipated needs which will in turn provide clearer <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to an individual as he or she makes the choices and decisions that relate to building a personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
  
<h2>Personal, anticipated information need</h2>

<p>The view of information need and information behaviour that emerges from the work described above is summarized by three overarching principles. First, that individuals have different <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and affective responses to information and they assimilate information accordingly; secondly, that people evaluate information differently; and thirdly that context is <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#wes97">Westbrook 1997</a>). The <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>premise is that people construct individual meanings within information seeking experiences. If this is so, then it stands to reason that when people engage in information behaviour they are not only attempting to satisfy existing information needs, they are also engaged in trying to lay the groundwork for <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>events that they anticipate will happen in their lives. Individuals are constantly trying to make their lives run more smoothly by anticipating what will come next and by planning and evaluating their present and potential needs for information. In this way, they are purposefully constructing the potential role in their daily professional and personal lives of information sources and channels that they encounter or locate. Information processing and use is multi-faceted. With varying degrees of <span>accuracy</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> individuals can predict multiple uses and <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel, and can evaluate the relevance of information to a need or task. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>number of research studies have, in fact, tested this <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with <span>observational</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>protocols that ask participants to evaluate the relevance of a particular item to a contrived information need (e.g., <a href="#eis88">Eisenberg 1988</a>; <a href="#jan91">Janes 1991</a>). These studies report no reluctance or inability among participants to make these judgments. The <span>extension</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of this premise is that individuals are also capable (again with varying degrees of accuracy) of assessing the <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>relevance of information sources and channels to potential needs or tasks&#8212;of making assessments of <em>personal, anticipated information need</em> .</p>
  
<p>The information field has <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>our understanding of the concept of information need by theorizing and observing the behaviour of information seeking and use. These insights have been used to inform the following propositions that elaborate the concept of  <em>personal, anticipated information need</em> .</p>
  
<h3>Proposition 1:  <em>Personal, anticipated information need</em>  is triggered by information
events</h3>
  
<p>When an individual locates, encounters or is given an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel, information use and evaluation behaviour <span>occurs</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> The information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel is evaluated against the individual's motives for seeking information (information need). These evaluations may result in immediate information use. But, contact with an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel (intentional or incidental) may also lead to evaluations that acknowledge the usefulness of the information but delay information use to another time&#8212;an anticipated moment of information use, hypothesized by the individual. Attributes of the information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel are used by the individual to make these assessments in relation to his or her sense of task, work-based or recreational information needs. The information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel is an amalgam of stimuli that evoke this assessment of  <em>personal, anticipated information need</em> within the information event.</p>
  
<h3>Proposition 2: Individuals have <span>differential</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>sensitivity and reactions to  <em>personal, anticipated information need</em>.</h3>
  
<p>An individual's sensitivity and reactions to personal, anticipated information need are affected by variables associated with the time and space of each information event. Reactions to an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel are based upon the individual's ability to make sense of the information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel&#8212;to effectively apply it to an information need; use it to make a decision, do a task, or address an interest; understand its <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>value; and to organize it for later access and use. The <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of an individual to react to  <em>personal, anticipated information need</em> and his or her repertoire of reactions to the stimuli of the information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel will differ. The processes of building and managing a personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on an individual's ability to make sense of an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel and then to predict its function in his or her life in relation to <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>tasks or information needs. This <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>acceptance of the information (a form of assessment and evaluation) and an understanding of the implications of delayed access to, and perhaps processing of, the information. </p>
  
<h3>Proposition 3:  <em>Personal, anticipated information need</em> predicts, but does not  guarantee, <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>information use</h3>
  
<p><em>Personal, anticipated information need</em> assigns value to an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel at a particular point in space and time. This value may change as the individual moves forward with his or her life. Anticipated <span>applications</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> tasks, decisions or interest levels may not eventuate. An anticipated need simply may not <span>occur</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> In other words, individuals make mistakes when they anticipate their <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>needs for information, and changing situations may affect an individual's   <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to make <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and enduring assessment of <em>personal, anticipated information need</em>.  When an individual creates a personal information <span>collection</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> he or she is attempting to select and keep (or at least to insure the availability of) useful information and to ignore useless information. Individuals will base these choices upon assessments of <em>personal, anticipated information need</em>. These assessments are not <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>error</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> however. People sometimes keep information that turns out to be useless and they sometimes take no steps to keep information   that turns out to be useful.</p>
  
<h3>Proposition 4:  <em>Personal, anticipated information need</em> informs the investments and valuations that underpin the processes of personal information collection</h3>
  
<p>The processes of selecting, keeping and maintaining information in a personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>require an investment of <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>effort and time. The extent of these investments by an individual will <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on his or her <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the relationship between anticipated information need and the information found or encountered. The goal of the personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is to maximize the potential benefit of selecting and keeping an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel while at the same time minimizing the <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>effort and time that this <span>requires</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> When an individual chooses to include an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel in the personal information <span>collection</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> this means that he or she has <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the relative value of the investment of time and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>effort required to achieve the benefit of having the information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel readily accessible. In cases where the  <em>personal, anticipated information need</em> is well defined, the individual may need to invest very little <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>effort and time to translate the selected information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel into <span>representations</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that position it in the personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> In cases where the  <em>personal, anticipated information need</em> is less well defined, selecting and keeping processes <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>an increased investment of <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>effort and time. </p>
  
<p>Perceptions of <em>personal, anticipated information need</em> <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>across a sensitivity continuum. At one end of this continuum, an individual can apply an assessment of  <em>personal, anticipated information need</em> to instantly reject information that has no immediate or likely application to his or her tasks, decisions, problems, interests or activities. In the same way, when an individual locates, encounters or is given information with <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>application to <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or specific tasks and interests, the recognition of  <em>personal, anticipated information need</em>  and the appropriate behaviour that will incorporate this <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel into the personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is readily invoked. At each end of the  <em>personal, anticipated information need</em>  sensitivity continuum we see a decrease, therefore,  in the <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>effort and time required for personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>processes. The immediate discarding of an unneeded information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>no <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by the individual and therefore little or no <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>effort. The translation of a highly valued information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel into the existing organizational structures of the individual's personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(relating the information to existing taxonomies that define the <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>tasks or interests of the individual) may also <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>little time and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>effort. At this end of the sensitivity continuum, the individual is also able to <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>recognize the value and benefit of his or her investment in personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>behaviour.</p>

  <p>The highest levels of investment in time and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>effort <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>across the middle of the  <em>personal, anticipated information need</em> sensitivity continuum where the visceral anticipated information needs of the user re0e. These vague and ill-defined needs are stimulated by the individual's contact with an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel but the anticipation of need is not readily or <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>translated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>into information <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or keeping behaviour. The individual's recognition of  <em>personal, anticipated information need</em>  is less clear. Estimating the relative value of an investment in <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and keeping decisions and actions against the potential benefits that may <span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>from including the information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel in the personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is, therefore, problematic. Individuals decide to keep information in their personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>based on their valuation of the relative costs of 1) rejecting information that later proves to be useful, or 2) selecting and keeping information that later proves to be useless. In situations where the costs of the latter are relatively high, individuals will be less likely to keep the information in their personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> On the other hand, if the cost of rejecting information that is later <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to be useful is high, then the individual will be more inclined to select and keep the information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or channel.</p>
  
<h3>Proposition 5: Sensitivity to <em>personal, anticipated information need</em> is a critical component of information literacy</h3>
  
<p>The challenge of <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and using information in our working and everyday lives has <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>increasing <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to the set of skills that individuals need for leading efficient and satisfying lives in an information age. Individuals must be effective users of information. They must also be skilful builders and managers of their personal information collection; where they collect, organize and store the information that they need to refer to on a <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>basis. The personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>should be cultivated and well-managed but many are overloaded and disorganized. They are often a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of frustration, anxiety, stress and embarrassment. The processes that construct the personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>rely fundamentally upon the individual's sensitivity to his or her information needs and anticipated information needs. The key to an effective personal information <span>collection</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> therefore, rests with the <span>accuracy</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and endurance of an individual's  <em>personal, anticipated information need</em> . Enhancing our sensitivity and appropriate responses to  <em>personal, anticipated information need</em> is, therefore, a key component of information literacy.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In <span>conclusion</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> personal information management includes a set of actions that attempt to bring order: the keeping behaviour of organizing and storing information and the behaviour of managing and using the information sources and channels that comprise the personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> This behaviour is underpinned and informed by each individual's ability to understand the information he or she needs for immediate and deferred <span>purposes</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> work-based or recreational: <em>personal, anticipated information need</em> . The effectiveness of the personal information <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>will firstly <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>upon how well each individual understands his or her <em>personal, anticipated information need</em>  and secondly on how he or she translates this understanding into the information behaviour that acquires and manages the information sources and channels that comprise the personal information <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
  
<p>There is a great <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of work yet to be done in the study of personal information management. In many respects personal information management is an individual challenge for all who strive to function more effectively and efficiently in the rich and challenging information environments that characterize our everyday working and personal lives. Our information needs are individual, and our responses to the stimuli of the 'information world' are personal, situational, multidimensional and dynamic. The more the information field knows about information behaviour, the more we marvel at how idiosyncratic and unpredictable it can be. The concept of  <em>personal, anticipated information need</em>  is <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in this article in an attempt to describe the conceptual foundation for selected behaviour associated with personal information management. The propositions that elaborate <em>personal, anticipated information need</em>  are <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>as a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for further research and for clarification, <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>validation or correction by the information
field. </p>

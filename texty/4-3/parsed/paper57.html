<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Information management is practised in organisations.  Yet information is used by individuals in those organisations.  The counterpoint between the organisation and its individual members has particular relevance to information management because of its responsibilities to both the organisation at one level and to individuals at another level.  This counterpoint means that we need to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>both the organisation and its members in information terms as a starting point for developing <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for effective information management in small and <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>sized enterprises (SMEs).  The purpose of the paper is to develop some general guidelines for effective information management.  There are three <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>topics:</p>

   <ul>
   <li>information and organisations</li>
   <li>information and managers</li>
   <li>information management in SMEs</li>
   </ul>



<p>SMEs, according to the standard EU definition, employ no more than 249 people, have less than 40 million ECU turnover and no more than 25 percent ownership or control by one or more enterprises which are not SMEs.</p>

<h2>Information and organisations</h2>

<p>This discussion of organisations and information has two parts to it.  The first provides an overview of organisations by examining a number of images used to describe them and then drawing some implications for information management.  The second outlines a hierarchy of <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information which are appropriate for organisations and draws further implications for information management.  The discussion concludes with a set of propositions about information management.</p>

<h3>Images of organisations</h3>

<p>Machines, <span>organisms</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> political <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and cultures (<a href="#morg">Morgan, 1986</a>): these are <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and conventional images of organisations.  To these can be <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>a fifth image which has emerged in the past decade or so: learner (<a href="#seng">Senge, 1990</a>).  Each image represents a <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on the nature of organisations.  For example the machine image suggests that information is one of the resources that keeps the wheels ticking over and the task of information management is to ensure that information is delivered where and when it is needed through clearly defined and <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>communication channels.  The organism image implies that information from internal and external sources is required to keep the organisation in a state of equilibrium.  Information management has a critical role in drawing in information about trends and developments in the external <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>so that the organisation can <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to changes triggered by social, economic, technological and legislative forces.</p>

<p>The image of the political system recognises quite <span>properly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that
because different groups in organisations have different interests
they will need and use information differently in the exercise
of power and influence, in the seeking of support and negotiating
<span>conflict</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>   The image is a reminder of the political and social
context of information management and draws <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to the ethics
of information management practice.  The image of the organisation
as culture is particularly powerful with its suggestions of shared
<span>beliefs</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>values</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> norms and meaning and its <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on ritual,
myth, language and <span>symbol</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>  It suggests that the use of information
in an organisation will have cultural aspects to it, in contrast
to the <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that the use of information is <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>a
<span>rational</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>human activity.  Information management has a clear role
in making meaning and will embody through its practice, the beliefs
and <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the organisations.</p>


<p>The image of the organisation as learner suggests a community
which regenerates itself through the creation of knowledge, the
outcome of learning.  Information management needs to ensure that
the organisation has the information and information capabilities
necessary to continuously adapt to its changing internal and external
environments.  It does this by adopting a forward-looking approach
and by adapting itself to the ambiguity and uncertainties found
in these environments.  We need to remind ourselves that the image
of the organisation as a learner is an emerging one which is still
posing questions to some organisation <span>theorists</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#spen">Spender, 1996</a>; <a href="#gran">Grant, 1996</a>).</p>

<p>Although none of these five images is by itself an adequate <span>representation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>
together they highlight the complexity of organisations and the
processes which sustain them.  It is this complexity which is
part of the context of information management in organisations
and informs information management practice.</p>


<p>What are some implications for information management that emerge
from these images of organisations?</p>

<ol>
<li>Information management has the potential to contribute to the <span>achievements</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of organisations
<li>Information management has different <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in different organisations.  These <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>will be <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by the organisation's goals as well as by its culture and its stance on information.
<li>Information management is practised in a political, social and cultural context which  shapes both what information management does and how it does it.
<li>Information management practice is value laden and so it has an ethical dimension.  The <span>ethics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information management practice are most often implicit.
<li>Organisational learning concepts and theory are applicable to information management in some organisations.  Not all organisations are ready for this development, nor is it an appropriate <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for all organisations.
</ol>

<h3>Some <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information</h3>

<p>Organisations are increasingly aware of the potential of information in providing competitive advantage and sustaining their success (<a href="#port">Porter, 1985</a>) as evidenced in a number of published case studies (<a href="#owen">Owens, <i>et al.</i>, 1996</a>; <a href="#grim">Grimshaw, 1995</a>) and commentaries (<a href="#broa">Broadbent, 1977</a>).  The descriptions of information as an asset and a resource (<a href="#burk">Burk & Horton, 1988</a>; <a href="#best">Best, 1996</a>) are no longer unusual.  However, the <span>origin</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of these descriptions in classical economics ignores the place of information in the fabric of a political system or culture of an organisation.  If information is to provide competitive advantage then its full potential needs to be con0ered.</p>

<p>A very useful hierarchy of <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information (<a href="#bram">Braman, 1989</a>) has been developed in the area of information policy studies.  The hierarchy is applicable to organisations for a number of reasons; firstly, it recognises the <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>differences among <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information; secondly, its macro view is more appropriate to organisations than <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>based only on the individual as an information user; thirdly, it provides a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>which are useful in different situations; and fourthly, it foreshadows the need for information policy in organisations.</p>

<p>The hierarchy consists of four levels, each based on a category of <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>from many different fields.</p>

<ol>
<li>Information as a resource.  &quot;Information, its creators, processors and users are viewed as discrete and isolated entities.  Information comes in pieces unrelated to <span>bodies</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge or information flows into which it might be organised&quot; (<a href="#bram">Braman, 1989</a>: 236).
<li>Information as a commodity.  Complementary to <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information as a commodity is the concept of an information production <span>chain</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>through which information gains in economic value.  The notion of information as a commodity incorporates &quot;the exchange of information among people and related activities as well as its use&quot; (<a href="#bram">Braman, 1989</a>: 238) and implies buyers, sellers and a market.  In contrast to the absence of power of information as a resource, information as a commodity has economic power.
<li>Information as <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of pattern.  Here the concept of information is broadened by the addition of context.  Information &quot;has a past and a <span>future</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> is affected by motive and other environmental and casual factors, and itself has effects&quot; (<a href="#bram">Braman, 1989</a>: 238).  The concept of information and its processes is broadened so much so that information in this sense can be applied to a highly articulated social structure.  Information has a power of its own although its effects are isolated.  The example given is of information reducing uncertainty but only in <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to a single specific question.
<li>Information as a constitutive <span>force</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in society.  Information has a role in shaping context.  &quot;Information is not just affected by its <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> but is itself an actor affecting other elements in the environment&quot; (<a href="#bram">Braman, 1989</a>:239).  The <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in this category &quot;apply to the entire <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of phenomena and processes in which information is involved, can be applied to a social structure of any <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of articulation and complexity, and grant information, its flow and use an enormous power in constructing our social (and <span>ultimately</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>physical) reality&quot; (<a href="#bram">Braman, 1989</a>: 214].
</ol>

<p>The hierarchy of <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information presents a broadly
based view of information and one which reflects the images of
organisations which have been discussed.  The traditional view
of information management has focussed very much on information
as a resource and as a commodity and on information management
as providing a service to the organisation.  That service has
taken the form of providing access to information in a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of
sources including on-line commercial databases, archival collections,
websites and in-house databases.  The definition of information
as <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of pattern extends information management into a
place in achieving the goals of an organisation.  It is as a constitutive
<span>force</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>though that information is most potent as a basis for future
<span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and innovation.  Information management shifts from service
provision to strategy formation.</p>

What implications can be <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for information management in organisations
from this hierarchy of <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information?</p>


<ol>
<li>Information management needs to encompass the full range
of information from a resource to a <span>force</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for change and development.

can be based on the impact of information on the organisation.

<p>Our con0eration of organisations and information has provided some implications for information management.

The implications have been <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>together in a number of propositions presented in Table 1 below.</p>

<h2>Information and Managers</h2>
<p>
Having looked at the broad organisational context of information
management, we need now to narrow our <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to individuals in
organisations.  Because of the responsibilities of managers in
strategy development and implementation and in enabling organisations
to meet their goals it is appropriate to restrict ourselves to
con0ering managers rather than all individuals in organisations.
 This discussion of managers and information is in two parts.
 The first part deals with the nature of managerial work as described
in a number of research studies and draws a number of implications
for information management.  The second part con0ers the nature
of information from the point of view of individual users of information
and is based on work in information science and in management.
 Again, implications for information management are <span>drawn</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>  The
discussion concludes with some propositions about information
management.</p>

<h3>The work of managers</h3>
<p>
The classic view of managerial functions as planning, organising,
communicating, coordinating and controlling (<a href="#fayo">Fayol, 1949</a>) <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>a rational
and ordered approach to management activities.  Yet studies of
managers in their workplaces present a picture of an approach
to managerial activities that is quite different.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>brief overview
of a number of studies based on questionnaires and observation
of managers in their workplaces highlight the seemingly active,
informal, fragmented and chaotic nature of managerial work.</p>
<p>
One study (<a href="#mint">Mintzberg, 1975</a>) identified ten different <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for managers.  The
<span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>were categorised into three groups to form an integrated
view of what senior managers do.  The interpersonal <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of figurehead,
leader and liaison stem from the manager's formal authority.
The informational <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of monitor, disseminator, and spokesman
<span>derive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>from the manager's interpersonal contacts.  In this role
the manager emerges as the &quot;nerve centre&quot; of the organisational
unit (<a href="#mint">Mintzberg, 1975</a>: 55).  The decisional <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of entrepreneur, disturbance
handler, resource handler and negotiator <span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>from the manager
as the formal authority of the organisational unit who can commit
the unit to <span>action</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>  This approach to managing acknowledges the
action-oriented, outward-looking and ritualistic aspects of managerial
work as well as managers' strong preferences for verbal media
in <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>information.</p>
<p>
Another study of managers at work identified three <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>processes
in which they are engaged (<a href="#kott">Kotter, 1982</a>):  agenda <span>setting</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>building
and implementing their agendas through networks.  The key challenges
for general managers <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the information and people oriented
demands of these three processes:  &quot;figuring out what to
do (making decisions) in an <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>characterised by uncertainty,
great diversity, and an enormous quantity of potentially relevant
information&quot; and &quot;getting things done (implementation)
through a large and diverse group of people despite having relatively
little control over them&quot; (<a href="#kott">Kotter, 1982</a>: 20).</p>
<p>
Networking is a <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of another view of managerial work (<a href="#luth">Luthaus, <i>et al.</i>, 1988</a>).
 Three other categories of activity developed from the research
of managers and their subordinates were routine communication,
traditional management and human resources management.  Networking
includes <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with out0ers and socialising/politicking
in0e and <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the organisation; routine communication activities
include exchanging information and handling paperwork; traditional
management activities consist of planning, decision making and
controlling; and human resource management includes motivating/reinforcing,
disciplining/ punishing, managing <span>conflict</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> staffing and training/developing.
 This study <span>distinguished</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>between successful and effective managers,
between those who are promoted and those who have &quot;satisfied,
committed subordinates and produce organisational results&quot;
(<a href="#luth">Luthaus, <i>et al</i>., 1988</a>: 62). We are reminded that managers have their own career interests
as well as interests in the organisations in which they work.
 The categories of activity contribute differently to success
and effectiveness.  Networking had the strongest relationship
with success, whereas routine communication had the strongest
with effectiveness.  The type of activity with the weakest relationship
with success is human resource management and with effectiveness
the weakest is networking.</p>
<p>
The final study con0ered here explores the work of middle managers.
 It suggests that managing relationships, <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>innovation,
creating a mindset and facilitating learning (<a href="#floy">Floyd &amp; Wooldridge, 1996</a>) are integral
to creating competitive advantage.  The study of middle managers
focussed on strategy formation, a process that moves away from
the overly <span>rational</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> command and control model of strategy as
a two stage process of formulation and implementation and has
&quot;more to do with learning than planning&quot; (<a href="#luth">Luthaus, <i>et al</i>., 1988</a>: 39).  Four
<span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>roles for middle managers in strategy were identified:
 championing strategic alternatives; synthesising information;
facilitating adaptability; and implementing deliberate strategy.
 By engaging in these <span>roles</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> middle managers link strategic purpose
and organisational <span>action</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
<p>
These studies of managerial work <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>across managers at different
levels in organisations from senior management to middle management.
 They also span different <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of organisational structures from
the more traditional hierarchies to post-entrepreneurial organisations
(<a href="#kant">Kanter, 1989</a>) with leaner, flatter structures and participative, team-based
work <span>units</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
<p>
What are some implications for information management that emerge
from this overview of managerial work?</p>

<ol>
<li>Information management has the potential to contribute to
the effectiveness of managers in their diverse organisational
<span>roles</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>

<li>Information management should seek to meet the information
needs of managers and enhance their information capabilities.

<li>Information management must recognise informal and formal
information sources and flows both internal and external to the
organisation.

<li>Information management needs to enable managers to integrate
<span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy and information.</ol>

<h3>Some <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information</h3>
<p>
Because managers in organisations use information and it is integral
to their work we need to be clear about what information is at
the level of individual users of information.  There are two perspectives
which are useful to a con0eration of information management
in organisations.  One comes from the field of information and
communication, the other from management.</p>
<p>
The first is <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to the user-oriented paradigm (<a href="#derv1">Dervin &amp; Nilan, 1986</a>) in information
studies and it developed as an alternative to the traditional
supplier-oriented paradigm which dominated earlier developments
in information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and the <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information technology
to information services.  This <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>posits that information
is a process that applies to adaptive and creative behaviour.
 It relies on <i>Information1</i>, or &quot;information which
describes reality, the <span>innate</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>structure or pattern of reality
....&quot;  (<a href="#derv2">Dervin, 1977</a>: 22) and <i>Information2</i> or &quot;ideas, the
structures or pictures imputed to reality by people&quot; (<a href="#derv2">Dervin, 1977</a>: 22).
 Individuals <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>between <i>Information2</i>, subjective, internal
information and<i> Information1</i>  objective, external information
by <i>Information3</i>, a set of behaviours, or the &quot;how&quot;
of the information process.</p>
<p>
Similar categories of information have been derived from an analysis
of <span>dictionary</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#buck">Buckland, 1991</a>): information-as-thing, information-as-knowledge
and information-as-process.  Information-as-knowledge is intangible
and to be communicated needs to be expressed or <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in
some physical way so becoming tangible information-as-thing.
The point is made that information-as-thing has a &quot;fundamental
role&quot; in information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#buck">Buckland, 1991</a>: 352), not only computer-based
<span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>but also libraries, museums and collections of potentially-informative
objects which might include people, products and events.</p>
<p>
The second <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> based on an analysis of successful companies
in Japan, is centred on the individual as a creator of new knowledge
(<a href="#nona">Nonaka, 1991</a>).  It draws a distinction between explicit and tacit knowledge.
 Explicit knowledge is formal, systematic and codified rather
like <i>Information1</i> or information-as-thing.  Tacit knowledge
is highly personal, consisting of technical skills and &quot;know-how&quot;
as well as having <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>dimensions such as implicit mental
models and <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>which shape our <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the world.
There are similarities among <i>Information2</i>, information-as-knowledge
and tacit knowledge.</p>
<p>
This <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>links individual and organisational knowledge.
 New knowledge always begins with an individual and it is this
individual's personal knowledge which is transformed into organisational
knowledge which is of value to the organisation as a whole.  There
are four patterns suggested for creating knowledge in an organisation
and some indications of the creation process through the spiral
of knowledge (<a href="#nona">Nonoka, 1991</a>: 97-99) are given.  These are similar to <i>Information3
</i> and information-as-process.</p>
<ol>
<li>From tacit to tacit which <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>when one individual shares
tacit knowledge <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with another for example through observation,
imitation, conversation so that it becomes part of another's tacit
knowledge base.  This knowledge rarely becomes explicit.
<li>From explicit to explicit which <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>when an individual
combines discrete pieces of explicit knowledge into a new whole,
for example when a finance director puts together information
collected from different sources in the organisation in a financial
report.
<li>From tacit to explicit which <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>when tacit knowledge
is articulated, for example when the finance director develops
a new approach to budgetary control based on tacit knowledge.
 The explicit knowledge created draws on the director's experience,
judgement, insight and know-how and it is then available for sharing
with others in the organisation.  This process extends the organisation's
knowledge base.
<li>From explicit to tacit which <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>when explicit knowledge
is shared <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the organisation and others internalise it
to broaden, reframe and extend their own tacit knowledge. For
example, the finance director's approach to budgetary control
is used by others in the organisation and it is <span>eventually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>taken
for granted as one of the organisation's <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or resources.
</ol>
<p>
These two perspectives on information present a contrast between
information as an object and information as a construct.  Both
<span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information are necessary for managers in organisations.
 Not only do managers use information as one of the resources
available to them but they also have a role in knowledge creation
for themselves, their co-workers and their organisations.  Because
information as a tangible object is usually easier to capture,
store, retrieve and disseminate, particularly with the ever-expanding
<span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of communication and information technologies available
to organisations, there is a risk that the value of intangible
information as a user construct will be overlooked.  Yet, it is
the &quot;informal, anomalous, multifaceted, interdisciplinary,
idiosyncratic individualistic aspects of information transfer&quot;
(<a href="#bawd">Bawden, 1986</a>: 210) which is <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>
What are some implications about information management that can

Implications for information management have emerged from this
overview of managers in their work <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and as users of information.
 They serve to elaborate and clarify the scope of information
management in organisations.  Some propositions about information
management are presented in Table 2 below.</p>

<p>
The propositions based on the nature of the information in organisations
and the nature of information in managerial work challenge information
management thinking and practice.  They underpin a shift in information
management away from the provision of information with an emphasis
on technology and access towards strategy with <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on information

<h2>Information management in SMEs</h2>
<p>
The propositions about information management shown in Tables
1 and 2 are based on an overview of organisations, managers' work
and information.  The propositions are tentative, some more so
than others.  They are however based on a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of perspectives,
the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>one being information which has the potential to sustain
an organisation's competitive position if it is used effectively
by the members of that organisation.  The <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>among the perspectives

<h3>Purpose of information management</h3>

<p><b>Information management contributes to the achievement of organisational
goals</b>.  There is little <span>doubt</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that information does contribute
to the success of organisations.  Whether information is regarded
as a resource or a <span>force</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for change and development it is clear
that information can contribute to the achievement of organisational
goals.  The assumptions are made that the goals of an organisation
are explicit, thus are known <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the organisation and there
is some way determining the extent to which the goals have been
met.</p>
<p>
<span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of high performing companies in the UK (<a href="#owen2">Owens, <i>et al.</i>, 1997</a>) found almost
<span>universal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>acceptance of the view that information is a valuable
asset.  The more successful companies were concerned with information
management issues and some were working towards the creation of
an information culture as a way of ensuring <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>success.
 In the words of one manager interviewed in the study:</p>

<blockquote>We do recognise that information is an asset and, thereby, we
should maximise the value from that asset, and make it available
to all those who can <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>value from it.  We are working on
the devolution of decision making responsibility.  We talk a lot
about flattening the organisation structure, and we have achieved
a certain amount of progress.  I think we've got the right attitude,
but we're still going through a learning process.  I believe the
more enlightened managers understand that a facultative management
<span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is the right <span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>business practice.  That staff
working in the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>processes are best placed to make these
processes effective, and these are the ones who really need the
information. (<a href="#owen2">Owens, <i>et al.</i>, 1997</a>: 25)</blockquote>
<p>
This manager's <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with the need to link <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy
and information has been shared by managers in other countries
in the western world (<a href="#broa2">Broadbent, 1992</a>).  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>key factor in linking or aligning
<span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy and information has been information technology,
a tool <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>success is a global economy.  The
potential for information technology and information to transform
organisations is evident in those companies which have redesigned
their <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>processes.  Information and information technology
have acted as enabling and integrating <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for survival and
<span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in rapidly changing environments (<a href="#joha">Johannessen &amp; Olaisen, 1993</a>; <a href="#more">Moreton, 1995</a>).</p>
<p>
<p><b>A process approach to information management supports the integration
of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy and information.</b>  The calls for integration
come from at least three different communities:  information management,
information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and management.  Successful companies are
those that adapt to and shape their environments and do so by
using and creating information in a process of continuous improvement
and innovation.</p>
<p>
Information management has been described in one particular model
as a continuous cycle of related activities which encompass the
information value <span>chain</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>  The activities in the cycle (<a href="#choo">Choo, 1995</a>: 24-26)
are:</p>

<ol>
<li>identification of  information needs defined by subject matter
requirements and situation
<li>information <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>evaluation of current sources,
assessment of new sources and matching of sources to needs
<li>information organisation and <span>storage</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the organisation's
memory or its knowledge and expertise
<li>information products and services aimed at enhancing the quality
of information
<li>information <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>through sharing information informally
or formally
<li>information use in the creation and application of information
in interpretation and decision making.
</ol>
<p>
Implicit in the model is organisational learning and the development
of individuals.  For example, information organisation and storage
activities will ensure that the organisation's knowledge is made
available to individuals or groups in an organisation and is built
on.  Information <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>activities can develop fresh insights
and <span>novel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>which can then be captured through organisation
and <span>storage</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>activities and made available for later use.  the
spiral of knowledge can be seen through this process approach
to information.</p>
<p>
The activities of identification of information needs and information
use are not always regarded as components of information management.
 Yet it is these two activities which <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the integration
of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy and information.  Information needs will
<span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in the context of the organisation's goals and the objectives
of work teams and it is this context which surrounds the use of
information.  Certainly these two activities are beyond the scope
of information resource management and information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>management
as they have been practised.</p>
<p>
The <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy and information also suggests
different ways of organising work and designing the organisation.
 Teams are very appropriate to strategy formation and achieving
competitive advantage.  In the learning organisation there are
three groups of experts who need to work together as knowledge
partners (<a href="#choo">Choo, 1995</a>).  The groups are <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>experts in the organisation
who create and use knowledge, for example operators, professional
managers; information experts with &quot;skills, training and
know-how for organising knowledge information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and structures
that facilitate the productive use of information and knowledge
resources&quot; (<a href="#choo">Choo, 1995</a>: 198); and information technology experts who
have specialised expertise in building and developing the organisation's
information infrastructure.</p>
<p>
The <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of each group of experts is different.  Organisation
effectiveness is the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>expert, enlightenment
is the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information expert and process efficiency
is the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information technology experts.  As the partners
in the teams work together they will create, organise and use
knowledge.  The partners will engage in learning and in furthering
the organisation's objectives.  They will <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>information responsibility
within the team and for themselves (<a href="#druc1">Drucker, 1988</a>).</p>
<p>
Key factors for success in SMEs reinforce the need for integration
of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy and information.  Managers in firms see their
success as dependent on their organisation's ability to accommodate
and manage change and to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to changes in their environments.
 The key factors are:</p>

<ul>
<li>relationships with customers and suppliers
<li>flatter management structures and better use of resources
<li>training and quality
<li>environmental issues  (<a href="#abel">Abell, 1994</a>: 236)</ul>
<p>
Each of these factors rests on information, its use, creation,
<span>storage</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>distribution</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>  Issues of the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information
(in terms of its <span>accuracy</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> validity, timeliness), its accessibility,
availability, <span>presentation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> ease of use, and its organisation
and <span>storage</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are the <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of teams or task forces developing
strategy or engaging in projects in relation to any one of these
factors.</p>

<h3>Scope of information management</h3>
<p>
<b>Information management is contextualised by the organisation
and is value-laden</b>.  The earlier discussion of images of organisations
suggests different <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to information management in organisations.
 While the objectives of information management will be linked
to the effectiveness of organisations, information management
practice will vary across organisations.  For example, in the
organisation which is like a machine, the information management
function might be centrally located in a unit <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to control
internally generated information.  This unit would have links
to an IT unit.  There might also be a library in the organisation
which provides an information service based on externally generated
information.  Depending on the industry sector, the market place,
the culture and the nature of work in the organisation, such a
structural arrangement for information management might be appropriate.
 The objectives and priorities for information management will
be framed within this context.</p>
<p>
By contrast, in the organisation which is like a learner, the
information management might be decentralised in a federal structure
which supports teams but locates some information management functions
centrally.  Each team will be responsible for providing information
to know how databases accessible through the organisation's intranet.
 Compared to the previous example, the objectives for information
management and priorities for services will be quite different.
 Some differences will be seen in:</p>

<ul>
<li>distinctions made between internally and externally generated
information
<li>the reuse and sharing of information arising from activities
in each organisation
<li>the relationship among library, information management and
IT staff
<li>the <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of IT
<li>the value attributed to information
<li>the information ethos
<li>measures of success used by the organisation and by information
management.
</ul>
<p>
It needs to be recognised that the differences in these two examples
are <span>valid</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>  There is no one approach to information management
which is inherently more effective than any other.</p>
<p>
An important element in information management is information
politics which <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the assumptions made about how people
generate and use information in organisations.  Some models of
information politics (<a href="#dave">Davenport, <i>et al.</i>, 1996</a>) that have been developed include:</p>

<ul>
<li>technocratic utopianism:  a heavily technical approach to information management stressing categorisation and modelling of an organisation's full information assets.
<li>anarchy:  the absence of any overall information management policy leaving individuals to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and manage their own information.
<li>feudalism:  the management of information by individual <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or functions, which define their own information needs and report only <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>information to the overall corporation. The definition of information categories and reporting structure by the firm's leaders, who may or may not share the information willingly after collecting it.
<li>federalism:  an approach to information management based on consensus and negotiation on the organisation's key information elements and reporting structures.
</ul>

<p>
The federalism model is <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>most appropriate to the organisation
as learner, although it is possible that a number of models could
co-exist in an organisation.  The models reinforce the point that
the context of the organisation is an important influence on information
management and a reminder that it may in fact act as a barrier
to the development of sound information management practice.</p>
<p>
The issue of context is applicable to SMEs as well as large organisations.
 It may be particularly relevant to SMEs which are interested
in <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>strategic partnerships with external information
services.  SMEs will need to clearly state their expectations
of any service providers and to evaluate the organisational context
of any partners so that the risks associated with potential sources
of difference can be assessed.</p>
<p>
<b>Information management must adopt a broadly-based approach
to information</b>.  Just as there is a hierarchy of definitions
of information there is possibly a hierarchy of <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of
information management.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>possible hierarchy of <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is

<p>
If information management is to influence the development of the
organisation then it should recognise as many categories of information
as possible, as broad a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of sources and media as possible,
and as broad a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of uses of information as possible.  The
information provided by the information expert in work teams should
be seamless and all information created by the team which is likely
to be of value should be organised and stored by the information
expert.  The information will no <span>doubt</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>be stored on many different
media including discs, <span>maps</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>photographs</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> brochures, <span>samples</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>
diagrams, videos, reports, printouts, all of which are part of
the organisation's memory and history and have the potential to
be reused in later projects.  The tacit knowledge of the team
becomes explicit knowledge for the next team or task <span>force</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>working
on a similar project.</p>
<p>
Information experts have a role in enhancing the information capabilities
of individuals in organisations.  Efforts to adapt human behaviour
to the information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>have not been successful.  IT offers
some potential for developing interactive <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>which should
be capable of adapting to human behaviour.  Systems are needed
for identifying information need by supporting IT experts and
managers in articulating their information needs, capturing information
or tacit knowledge for <span>storage</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in databases and adding value to
information.</p>
<p>
There are a number of <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to adding value to information
already in use but there is room for further development.  In
organisations information experts might <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with managers
their media preferences, information use <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and barriers
they have encountered in using and applying knowledge.  Information
experts can then begin tailoring information products and services
to enable managers to make decisions, <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>problems, think strategically,
scan the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and carry out other aspects of their work
<span>roles</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>  One approach adds value to information to help information
users match the information provided by a system with their needs
(<a href="#tayl">Taylor, 1985</a>).  The <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>include ease of use, noise <span>reduction</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>
<span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> adaptability, time-saving and cost saving.  Another approach
is directed toward reducing information overload for managers
(34) by increasing the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information.  Some of the values
are related to the scarcity of information and the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of confidence
a manager places in information.</p>
<p>
It is possible for SMEs to adopt a broadly-based approach to information
and ensure that the information they need in order to maintain
their competitive advantage is accessible and usable.  There are
a number of published studies and commentaries (<a href="#choo">Choo, 1995</a>; <a href="#tayl">Taylor, 1985</a>; <a href="#brow">Browne, 1993</a>; <a href="#diam">Diamantopoulos &amp; Souchon, 1996</a>) outlining
managers' information behaviour and from them further approaches
for adding value to information can be developed.  The studies
challenge some common assumptions <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by information professionals
about managers' <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to information, their use of it in decision
making and the <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>they develop to cope with vast quantities
of information.</p>

<h3>Implementing information management</h3>
<p>
<b>Managers are in a unique position to integrate information
and <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy</b>.  Successful implementation of information
management presupposes senior management support, expressed most
visibly in funding priorities and through information-related
activities and projects from training programs to information
system enhancements.  The <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information and business
strategy presupposes a learning organisation which is team based.
 Managers as <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>experts are able to use and create information
and knowledge so that both information and <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy are
embedded in the innovations, products, processes or services developed
by the team.</p>
<p>
It is in their daily work that managers have opportunities to
integrate <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy and information.  In the knowledge
creating company (<a href="#nona">Nonaka, 1991</a>) there is a continual shift in meaning as
new knowledge is diffused through the company .  At times the
confusion created by this shift escalates to ambiguity and even
chaos which can lead to fresh insights and a new sense of <span>direction</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>
 The job of managers is then to &quot;orient this chaos towards
purposeful knowledge creation&quot; (<a href="#nona">Nonaka, 1991</a>: 103).  Senior managers
articulate metaphors, <span>symbols</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and concepts about the company's
<span>future</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> middle managers orient the chaos with their co-workers
on company teams.  In the learning organisation, middle managers
make explicit the tacit knowledge of senior managers and their
co-workers and incorporate it into new technologies and products.
 In this sense, managers are knowledge engineers.  In other words,
middle managers  and their teams create information as an object
on the basis of the information constructs of others.</p>
<p>
This process is similar to some <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge work.
 One <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to &quot;activities using individual and external
knowledge to produce outputs characterised by information content&quot;
(<a href="#dave2">Davenport <i>et al.</i>, 1996</a>: 54).  Another suggests that knowledge work characterised by
variety and exception and is performed with a high level of skill
and expertise.  Included in knowledge work processes are activities
such as <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> accounting, research and development, law and
management processes of strategy and planning (<a href="#dave2">Davenport <i>et al.</i>, 1996</a>).  This view
suggests that there are five different processes in knowledge
work:</p>

<ol>
<li>finding existing knowledge, understanding knowledge requirements,
searching for it among multiple sources and passing it on to a
user.  An example is a competitive intelligence process in an
insurance company.
<li>creating new knowledge in say creative processes in advertising
or research activities in a pharmaceutical firm.
<li>packaging knowledge created externally to the processes.  An
example is the editing, <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and proofing processes in publishing.
<li>applying existing knowledge, for example is a surgeon applying
existing medical knowledge.
<li>revising knowledge.  Examples are the reuse of existing components
in an engineering project or the re0ential development of former
warehouses.
</ol>

<p>
These five processes are used by managers and all are dependent
on information.  By engaging in these processes in their role
in strategy formation managers are able to integrate information
and <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy.  These knowledge work processes are possible
in SMEs.  Smaller organisations might in fact have more flexibility
in <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to project teams.  They may also have advantages in
being able to apply existing knowledge or create new knowledge
through innovation.  The task of information management is to
enable managers to engage effectively in knowledge work.  Key
<span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by information management include:</p>

<ul>
<li>developing information filters so that that <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information
is contained
<li>enhancing the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information
<li>building know-how databases
<li>facilitating information sharing across teams
</ul>

<p>
Managers in SMEs <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by effective information management
and information experts, like their colleagues in large organisations,
are well placed to integrate information and <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy.</p>
<p>
<b>The effectiveness of information management can be measured
by the extent of knowledge creation or innovation in organisations.</b>
 The evaluation of information management needs to take into account
different views on information.  Evaluation  based solely on information
as object or tangible information will be misleading.  The focus
of evaluation needs to include also information as a construct
and information processes.  One approach to the evaluation of
information management could be based on the processes of information
management discussed earlier.  Another approach might be based
on innovations in the organisation and might include con0eration
of the information capabilities of managers and their co-workers.</p>
<p>
The measures of the effectiveness of information management will
be very similar in SMEs and large organisations.  They will be
directed towards teams and the organisation itself.  Some measures
will <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>evaluation over a <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of time, for example when
the information ethos of an organisation is used as an indicator
of effective information management.  Other measures might be
applied over shorter time periods for example in the evaluation
of training programs.  The indicators will <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>qualitative
and quantitative measures.  The challenge is to identify what
it is that information and learning have made possible in an organisation.</p>
<p>
Information management has multiple meanings.  Its meanings are
shaped by different perspectives on information, on organisations
and on the work of managers.  Information management has the potential
to transform organisations but only when information and business
strategy are integrated.  Managers in SMEs and large organisations
have a key role in putting information to productive use and ensuring
that their organisations are successful.  In the words of Drucker:</p>


<blockquote>&quot; ... knowledge is the only meaningful resource today.  The
traditional &quot;factors of production&quot; - land (ie natural
resources), labour and capital - have not disappeared, but they
have become <span>secondary</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>  They can be obtained, and obtained <span>easily</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>
provided there is knowledge.  And knowledge in this new sense
means knowledge as a <span>utility</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> knowledge as the means to obtain
social and economic results.  These developments, whether desirable
or not, are responses to an irreversible change: <i>knowledge
is now being applied to knowledge.</i>  Supplying knowledge to
find out how existing knowledge can best be applied to produce
results is, in effect, what we mean by management.  But knowledge
is now also being applied systematically and purposefully to define
what new knowledge is needed, whether it is feasible, and what
has to be done to make knowledge effective.  It is being applied,
in other words, to systematic innovation&quot; (<a href="#druc2">Drucker, 1993</a>: 42).</blockquote>
<p>
In organisations, information management is the key to systematic
innovation and to the benefits that innovation brings.</p>

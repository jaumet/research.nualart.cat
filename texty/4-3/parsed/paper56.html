<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>Expansion of higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>has led to a need for improved efficiency in administrative services, along with a greater <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and flexibility in <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>programmes than currently exists:  new organisational structures are required (<a href="#ref2">Ford <i>et al.</i>, 1996</a>).   <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>number of UK HEIs are currently attempting to use Business Process Re-Engineering (BPR) as a change management strategy to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>improvements in service.   BPR arose at the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of the 1990s following attempts by large US companies to use Information Technology (IT), for linking <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>processes that cut across functional boundaries (<a href="#ref3">Hammer &amp; Champy, 1993</a>).   The aim was to secure competitive advantage.   <a href="#ref4">Penrod and Dolence</a>(1992) view re-engineering as a <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>means for ensuring HEIs adapt to the changing demands being placed upon them.   However, as with other managerial imports from the private sector, there is some question over whether BPR can be applied to a public sector <span>setting</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   Following many failures, BPR is no longer a <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>that inspires confidence in the private sector (<a href="#ref3">Martinsons &amp; Revenaugh, 1997</a>). One of the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>reasons for this high <span>failure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>rate is thought to be BPR&rsquo;s <span>failure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to successfully manage the change of people (<a href="#ref">Davenport, 1995</a>).   In common with other public sector institutions, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have a number of strong interest groups that make achieving change a complex task.   Thus, there is likely to be an even greater <span>resistance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in HEIs to change than in private sector companies.   Attaining agreement on how processes should be redesigned is likely to be problematic.</p>

<p>The aim of this paper is to examine the applicability of BPR to Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and, particularly, to determine how the &lsquo;people&rsquo; element of re-engineering projects in HEIs effects the success of such projects.   The <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>is of great <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>for the competitiveness of nations (<a href="#ref4">Porter, 1990</a>). It follows, therefore, that achieving successful change in HEIs is of the utmost importance, and determining the applicability of BPR to <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>is a highly significant exercise.   If &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; working <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>are no longer efficient in the <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>university, then HEIs must determine effective ways of successfully achieving change.   The experience with BPR in the private sector has demonstrated that failing to change people has been a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>barrier to success. </p>

<p>There are differing <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of what BPR <span>constitutes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> but this paper does not aim to offer a precise definition of BPR:  the <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>is to examine HEIs where process-orientated change initiatives are <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>place.   <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>number of case studies have been constructed to analyse the applicability of BPR to HEIs, focusing on the extent to which organisational culture challenges successful implementation.   This research started with a broad research question: How does organisational culture in HEIs impact on the implementation of BPR programmes?</p>

<h2>2. Research Design</h2>

<p>Appropriate <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of a research method was a key issue at the outset of the dissertation.   This enabled worthwhile data to be collected from a number of HEIs carrying out BPR projects;  it also ensured that <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis of the data produced valuable conclusions.   <a href="#ref5">Yin</a> (1994) advocates a case-study approach for research that is concerned with addressing &lsquo;how&rsquo; and &lsquo;why&rsquo; type questions.   This approach involves <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>enquiry that investigates a contemporary <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in its real life context (<a href="#ref4">Rose, 1991</a>).   Case-study research is therefore an appropriate strategy, as it examines how BPR programmes in HEIs are effected by organisational culture and <span>resistance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to change from within the organisation.   Case studies are <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>by collecting data which represents an interpretation of the research subjects&rsquo; experiences, opinions and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#ref3">McCormack Steinmetz, 1991</a>).   The case studies for this research are based mainly on the interview accounts of project stakeholders in <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>undergoing BPR programmes. Seven interviews were carried out at five Universities. The interviews were semi-structured, and based on an interview schedule. The questions <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>used in the interviews changed in the interview process, but usage of a schedule helped ensure all key areas of the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>were covered (<a href="#ref3">McCormack Steinmetz, 1991</a>). </p>
                        

<h2>3. Pressure for Change and BPR</h2>


<p>In common with other public sector institutions, Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) are seeking to <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the three &lsquo;Es&rsquo; of efficiency, effectiveness and economy, by adopting private sector managerial techniques (<a href="#ref">Dobson &amp; McNay, 1996</a>).   Business Process Re-Engineering is currently been used as a change management strategy in a number of UK HEIs.   <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>number of interrelated pressures have created the need for change in UK HEIs:  <span>expansion</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of higher education;  changing student profile;  pressures from industry;  increased competition;  information technology (IT) capability (<a href="#ref">Armstrong <i>et al.</i>, 1997</a>;  <a href="#ref2">Ford <i>et al.</i>, 1996</a>;  <a href="#4">Slowey, 1995</a>).</p>

<p>The UK now has a mass system of higher <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   The 1990s has seen the number of <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>double;  student numbers have quadrupled over the last 30 years (<a href="#ref4">Scott, 1995</a>).   Thus the traditional structure of higher <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> with an <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>on staff-student contact is no longer adequate:  &lsquo;There are not enough lecturers, library books or rooms, and there is not enough time...we have no <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>but to do things differently&rsquo; (<a href="#ref2">Ford, <i>et al.</i>, 1996</a>: 17). New organisational structures are required to support new learning processes. </p>

<p>Despite the great potential for use of  IT in higher <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> it is not a common <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning in most institutions (<a href="#ref2">Hall &amp; White, 1997</a>).   This is a further pressure for change as HEIs must take advantage of IT developments to improve course delivery and reduce costs.   <a href="#ref3">Hicks</a> (1997) views the present higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>system as being too fragmented, wasteful and inefficient.   It is characterised by too many <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>participating in the same activities (e.g. lectures) at the same time:  within a HEI there are <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>on different <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>programmes covering the same materials in different locations.   Exchange of information is not sufficiently exercised in HEIs:  this can be seen as a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>inefficiency (<a href="#ref4">Tann, 1995</a>).   One of the advantages of multi-media resource-based learning, is the reusability of resources:  <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>from different <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>programmes  - even different institutions -  can access the same information as and when required (<a href="#ref2">Hall &amp; White, 1997</a>).   Increasing resource-based learning would result in fewer <span>lectures</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> whilst the remaining <span>lectures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>could be enhanced by <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>technology (<a href="#ref">Barker, 1997</a>).   <a href="#ref3">Hicks</a> (1997) comments that most studies of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>based learning demonstrate its greater cost effectiveness by <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to conventional learning.   Taken to its extreme, multi-media resource-based learning results in the &lsquo;virtual university&rsquo;, an &lsquo;institution&rsquo; not bound by the constraints of physical boundaries and accessible anywhere, anytime (<a href="#ref3">Hansen &amp; Lombardo, 1997</a>).</p>

<h3>Re-engineering HEIs</h3>

<p>Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) has been identified in some quarters as a means by which <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>can meet these pressures for change, utilising IT to increase efficiency and effectiveness (<a href="#ref4">Penrod &amp; Dolence, 1992</a>; <a href="#ref2">Dougherty, 1994</a>; <a href="#ref">Casey, 1995</a>).   <a href="#ref2">Ford <i>et al.</a></i> (1996) argue that BPR could enable HEIs to develop organisational structures that enable innovative <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning methods, whilst maintaining some element of the important student-teacher relationship.   For <a href="#ref4">Penrod &amp; Dolence</a> (1992), BPR has significant potential for re-engineering the administrative functions of <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and ensuring control of higher education&rsquo;s costs.</p>

<p>BPR involves identification of the key <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>objectives of the organisation, and ensuring effective attainment of these objectives by redesigning <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>processes.   Instead of the rigid functional boundaries <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>by say, a &lsquo;sales department&rsquo; and a &lsquo;purchasing department&rsquo;, <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and tasks are grouped around key <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>processes.   <a href="#ref3">Hicks</a> (1997) con0ers that in the current <span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> HEI departments work primarily on an independent basis.   Arguments for re-engineering HEIs, advocate the establishment of institution-wide processes and dependencies across departmental boundaries.   This can mean totally obliterating processes and starting over again, <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>away from outdated and inefficient processes (<a href="#ref2">Hammer, 1990</a>).   The motivation for this is the application of technology in organisations was  often more to do with automating existing processes , what can be described as automating &lsquo;the existing mess&rsquo;. Most work flows and job descriptions were developed before computers were <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>into organisations;  processes have evolved rather than been <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#ref3">Hammer &amp; Champy, 1993</a>).   Thus, for advocates of BPR, there is no <span>rational</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>justification for the retention of <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>processes in the <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>organisation.   <a href="#ref3">Martinsons and Revenaugh</a> (1997) comment that BPR has the potential to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the re-engineered organisation&rsquo;s efforts on value-adding tasks, and reduce the number of workers required to perform a task. The processes that are re-engineered must be core processes, vital to the <span>business</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> or initiatives will have little impact on overall <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#ref4">Thackray, 1993</a>).   If a core <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>element of an HEI is effective student learning (<a href="#ref2">Eastcott &amp; Farmer, 1996</a>), then a BPR initiative would attempt to utilise IT to link <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning processes across the functional boundaries of academic departments.</p>

<p>A <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>component required for the establishment of institution wide processes and dependencies in a University, is the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of an integrated IT infrastructure (<a href="#ref4">Penrod &amp; Dolence, 1992</a>).   This enables information to be transferred and accessed <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the organisation and information becomes an institution-wide resource:  &lsquo;...it is <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>this enabling infrastructure that facilitates and helps drive the process of redesigning processes and procedures of the institution.&rsquo; (<a href="#ref4">Penrod &amp; Dolence, 1992</a>: 20).   An institution-wide IT strategy leads to effective networking of voice, data and video;  these are accessed regionally, nationally and even internationally.   <a href="#ref">Buchanan and Gibb</a> (1998) <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>information to be a resource, that generates the knowledge required to achieve the goals and objectives of the <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>organisation.   For this reason, information can be regarded as a key <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of competitive advantage (<a href="#ref4">Ross <i>et al.</i>, 1996</a>).   Penrod and Dolence argue that re-engineering is a means for achieving competitive advantage through effective management of information:  &lsquo;Reengineering is needed for <span>business</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> industry, government, and educational enterprises to successfully <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>into the information/service economy&rsquo; (1992: 1).   At present, <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>tend to be fragmented so that information is restricted to individual academics and departments.   <a href="#ref2">Ford <i>et al.</a></i> 
                        argue that if the challenge is to develop new and more appropriate learning environments then:  &lsquo;this demands a new approach to course <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and information management which cannot successfully be <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>without <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>new <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>processes&rsquo; (1996: 32).</p>

<p>Re-engineering strives to counter poor responsiveness to customer needs (<a href="#ref5">Willmott, 1994</a>).   <a href="#ref">Berry <i>et al.</a></i> (1990) point to the fact that customers are the real judges of service <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> but that this is not reflected in management decision making.   Value is <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>when an organisation&rsquo;s activities are shaped to <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>meet customer demands. For instance, the intention when re-engineering administrative processes in HEIs, is to make processes more student centred:  processes should exist to meet students&rsquo; needs (<a href="#ref4">Penrod &amp; Dolence, 1992</a>).   Successful BPR <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>that processes are broadly defined in terms of customer (or cost) value, to improve <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>across the entire <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>unit (<a href="#ref2">Hall <i>et al.</i>, 1993</a>).   <a href="#ref3">Kirkham</a> (1996) stresses the importance of the diagnostic phase for determining processes to be re-engineered.   In HEIs, the diagnostic phase would involve <span>surveying</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>both employees (academics, support staff) and customers (students) regarding their opinions on the services provided by the university.   Above all, diagnosis is used to identify customers&rsquo; service expectations (<a href="#ref">Berry <i>et al.</i>, 1990</a>).</p>

<p>Re-engineering results in a workforce characterised by teams of multi-skilled flexible individuals, empowered by technological innovation. (<a href="#ref3">Hammer &amp; Champy, 1993</a>).   Bureaucratic delays are wiped out as employees in re-engineered organisations are empowered to contact sources of knowledge <span>direct</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> 0e-stepping several tiers of management to complete what may previously have been a long cumbersome process in minutes.   Empowerment is an important <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of BPR (<a href="#ref4">Penrod &amp; Dolence, 1992</a>).   Employees are <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>accountable for the success of the organisation; empowerment means that individual efforts can contribute <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to organisational success.   As re-engineered jobs are organised around outcomes, employees perform all steps in a process rather than just a <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of tasks.</p>

<p>Implementing a BPR project is 
                        far from a straightforward activity.   It has not <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>been an unqualified success in the private sector, where following many failures it is now a widely derided practice (<a href="#ref3">Martinsons &amp; Revenaugh,1997</a>).   <a href="#ref2">Grint</a> (1995) comments that 70% of BPR programmes fail.   <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>reason for this high <span>failure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>rate is thought to be BPR&rsquo;s <span>failure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to successfully take account of people in the re-engineering of processes:  treating these people as &lsquo;bits and bytes&rsquo; to be re-engineered (<a href="#ref">Davenport, 1995</a>).   According to <a href="#ref5">Willmott</a> (1995), the rhetoric surrounding BPR is powerful, confident and persuasive, but its <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>science and engineering <span>roots</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>lead to it having a <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>appreciation of the human dimension of organisational change.   <a href="#ref2">Geus&rsquo;s</a> (1997) research into long standing successful private sector companies, reveals their success has been built on a recognition that people are an organisation&rsquo;s <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>asset.   These long standing companies have a &lsquo;sense of community&rsquo;:  if the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>&lsquo;dies&rsquo; then so does the <span>business</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   People are seen as more important than production.   BPR <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to counter years of employee commitment when processes are radically revised.   <a href="#ref5">Willmott</a> (1994) argues that employees are assumed by BPR to be <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>adjusted to fit new processes.   If employee <span>resistance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>occurs</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> it represents inertia and can be dealt with provided that senior management are sufficiently persuasive.   BPR fails to take account of the fact that employee objections might be legitimate.</p>

<p>HEIs now have strategic plans which might be seen as useful for formulating BPR initiatives.   However, a university is a highly complex organisation where there are many different ideas about what the university is trying to achieve (<a href="#ref4">Taylor, 1995</a>).   Taylor comments that the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>is less problematic in companies, where the executive define the mission and everyone is <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to work towards that mission.   The mission of HEIs is <span>complicated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>by a tradition of academic freedom in which individual academics develop autonomously;  management <span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>towards administrative rather than proactive leadership (<a href="#ref5">Thorley, 1995</a>).   Academic freedom has been somewhat countered in the 1990s, in that academics are subject to an increasing number of accountability <span>mechanisms</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> such as Teaching <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>assessments (<a href="#ref3">Hodges, 1998</a>).   Nonetheless, despite these increasing constraints, BPR initiatives in higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>will face a culture of individualism in higher education;  any BPR project will have to overcome this problem (<a href="#ref2">Hall &amp; White, 1997</a>).   The <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>might be that staff feel demoralised at the loss of &lsquo;academic freedom&rsquo;, creating an atmosphere that is not conducive to innovation and improved <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#ref3">Kirkham, 1996</a>).   Change in Higher Education has tended to restrict academic freedom, so further radical change is unlikely to be welcomed (<a href="#ref3">Palfreyman &amp; Warner, 1996</a>).   For instance, at the University of East Anglia some faculty perceived the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of modular courses and semesters as restrictive, rather than a means for providing <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>with greater flexibility (the <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>purpose) (<a href="#ref4">Rich &amp; Scott, 1997</a>).   Academics will also be concerned that re-engineering is a threat to their professional <span>status</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> as their role might change to that of managing and building learning resources (<a href="#ref3">House &amp; <span>Watson</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> 1995</a>).   Empowerment might be emphasised as a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>feature of BPR, but re-engineering programmes tend to be very authoritarian (<a href="#ref4">Thackray, 1993</a>).   Leaders of change are required to dictate where the organisation is going for the change strategy to be successful  - even though the organisation&rsquo;s employees find the process of change unacceptable.</p>

<p>Strategic change must therefore 
                        take account of organisational culture (<a href="#ref">DeLisi, 1990</a>).   Re-engineering can be criticised for failing to adequately link organisational culture with <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>culture.   Culture is often defined as &lsquo;the way we do things around here&rsquo; (<a href="#ref">Dobson &amp; McNay, 1996</a>).   This might seem a straightforward notion, but it hides an <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>complexity and <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>that must be attributed to organisational culture (<a href="#ref3">Heracleous, 1995</a>). According to <a href="#ref3">Johnson</a> (1992), the culture of an organisation is <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>by a &lsquo;paradigm&rsquo;, which is the core set of <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>by employees.   The paradigm develops <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the history of the organisation, and is shared to varying degrees by members of the organisation.   Current processes and <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>are inextricably linked with the paradigm:  &lsquo;it lies within a cultural web which bonds it to the <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of organizational life.&rsquo; (<a href="#ref3">Johnson, 1992</a>: 30).   Effective organisational change is therefore likely to be <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>when it is in <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>with the organisational paradigm and the cultural, social and political norms of organisational life.   The problems begin when radical change  - such as that associated with BPR -  attempts to take people away from the &lsquo;core beliefs&rsquo;:  &lsquo;the way we do things around here&rsquo;.   Thus incremental change is more likely to succeed as it entails minimal disruption to the paradigm.   This seems to be particularly the case in HEIs where successful change <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to be of an organic nature:  it does not go against the grain (<a href="#ref2">Elton, 1997</a>).</p>

<p>Achieving a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>where academic and support staff are in agreement with change is a far from easy task.   However:  &lsquo;Managing change successfully, <span>ultimately</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>depends upon <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and shared <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and objectives, for the managers and the managed.&rsquo;(<a href="#ref3">House &amp; <span>Watson</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> 1995</a>: 19).   <a href="#ref4">Slee</a> (1995) describes the implementation of a Total <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>Management (TQM) initiative in his department (at the University of Durham), as succeeding because the philosophy underpinning the approach was in tune with the existing staff value system.   This was implemented in a single department;  institution-wide change is likely to involve negotiating a wider <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of mindsets.   However, achieving change across an entire HEI <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>on an ability to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>consensus quickly (<a href="#ref4">Rich &amp; Scott, 1997</a>).   The need for consensus could be a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>barrier for utilising BPR in HEIs, particularly if the aim is to achieve radical change.</p>

<p><a href="#ref2">Hall and White</a> (1997) argue that the technological barriers associated with <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>based learning  - such as operating across different <span>hardware</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>platforms -  are far easier to overcome than the cultural issues in HEIs.   For instance, academics seek to put their own <span>spin</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>on learning.   As <a href="#ref">Davenport</a> (1995) comments, IT is useful when it helps people to work, but simply ploughing resources into technology and not working with people to develop its use has a negative impact. Innovations such as the &lsquo;virtual laboratory&rsquo; which simulate &lsquo;real-life&rsquo; science experiments, could play a <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>role in the re-engineered HEI:  providing access to learning any time, any place, at a reduced cost.   However, the challenge is to achieve a <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>between <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and real-life (<a href="#ref3">Hicks, 1997</a>).   Organisational culture can be an <span>instrument</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of competitive advantage (<a href="#ref5">Willmott, 1993</a>).   From this viewpoint, the fact that the culture of <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>emphasises the human element is a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of advantage.   Strengthening this culture is a means for enhancing organisational <span>performance</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> because it will secure greater commitment and flexibility from employees (<a href="#ref5">Willmott, 1993</a>).   <a href="#ref">Brown</a> (1997) argues that if the &lsquo;humanity&rsquo; of HEIs is <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>then they will not function:  <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>are <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>people-centred institutions</p>

<h2>4. The research environments</h2>

<p>Five <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>provided the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>for this research:  they are anonymised in the following account of their <span>characteristics</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>  Midland University is a 50-year-old multi-campus University, with high ratings for both <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and research.   It has over 20,000 <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and undergraduate places are highly <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>after.   The &lsquo;BPR initiative&rsquo; is concerned with the improvement of administrative processes, identifying how efficiency gains could be made in administrative services by meeting the needs of the University&rsquo;s Schools. In the initial stages, the management group (led by the Vice Chancellor) appointed a team to evaluate administrative activities, and then recommend appropriate programmes for improvement. The team was <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to BPR project management by a leading management consultancy.   Consultation was undertaken at all levels of the organisation to enable evaluation of administrative processes.</p>

<p>Highland University was an early foundation and despite a history of change, retains some archaic <span>characteristics</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   However, it is a very successful institution with high ratings for both <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and research.   Departments within the institution have a significant level of autonomy, which means change programmes have to secure the agreement of many factions:  change <span>purely</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>from the top cannot be <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>under the current <span>framework</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>significant power is the senate which consists of 450 university members, compared to a senate of just 25 in Newcastle University (a comparable institution). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>component of the BPR project is a Student Information Project.   Student information and <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>regulations at Highland are highly complex. Consultation was undertaken <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the various administrative services and with academic departments within the institution.</p>

<p>North Eastern University (NEU) is a centre of excellence in <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and research.   The University is based on two sites, with a <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>campus housing most academic departments and services. Changes have been occurring in this institution since the early 1990s, when in common with many other Universities, academic <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>courses were restructured into modules and semesters.   At the same time there were moves within the University to co-ordinate management and administrative computing.   In 1994 NEU set up a Information Strategy Review Group (ISRG) which following analysis of the institution&rsquo;s activities, identified 12 <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>institution-wide processes (e.g.: &lsquo;managing the estate&rsquo; and &lsquo;student course provision&rsquo;). The ISRG <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>has been on administrative processes, but the intention is to redirect activities to <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning support:  Web based <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>resources are being developed.</p>

<p>Yorkshire University, one of the largest civic Universities in the UK, has a commitment to promoting excellence whilst achieving and sustaining international standing in <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> learning and research.   Yorkshire is implementing a <span>major</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> new MIS for finance, human resources pay roll and student administration.   This represents a huge &pound;4-5m <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>investment for the University.   As with North Eastern University, a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>project <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the devolution of control of <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to departmental level.   Central administration will then be able to take on a more strategic, customer focused role, monitoring trends and benchmarking administrative services against competitors:  recognition that Higher Education is becoming an increasingly competitive market.   This current initiative is not being given the BPR label, partly to avoid association with a previous, <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>attempt at re-engineering administration. The new MIS will provide the <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>that resource centres have been lacking to do an efficient management job.   There has been <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>consultation with the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>user groups to enable determination of system requirements. The Vice Chancellor has an active interest in the advancement of knowledge management, so there is a commitment from the top for strategic information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>development.</p>

<p>North Western University (NWU) has a more managerial ethos, with more hierarchical and centralised management structures than are present in longer <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>universities (Thorley, 1995).  Despite top rated <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in some departments, this HEI is having to negotiate a precarious financial <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   The Executive (Vice Chancellor, Provost, Bursar, Registrar) have given backing to a wholesale process redesign:  change of a more radical nature than is displayed in the other case study sites is aimed for.   Members of the Executive worked with some high level <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>consultants for a <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of about three months on developing corporate strategy.   <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>&lsquo;transformation report&rsquo;, recommending changes across the entire institution, has been prepared by a transformation <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>team. Currently a number of <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>can be identified;  a coherent corporate strategy is not in existence. An integrated information system is an important component of change, as currently there are 17 officially recognised databases and many others are in existence, with all the related problems such as <span>duplication</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>being created as a result. The intention is to go back to basics and determine what <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>needs to be done to complete a process, rather than simply seeking to improve current <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>5. Factors affecting the change process</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The BPR projects at the case study HEIs are still being implemented.   For this reason, the interviews <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to examine the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of the projects, the challenges that project stakeholders are facing in the initial stages of project roll-out and anticipated problems.   The discussion that follows, begins by identifying how projects are initiated and the wide consultation that goes on at the outset of the BPR programmes.   <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of factors are then identified that make implementing BPR in these institutions a difficult <span>proposition</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The cases are reviewed under the headings of: Project Intiaition, Wide Consultation, Senior Managment Approval, Complex Information Requirements, Insitutional Politics and Entrenched Values, Academic Freedom, Inertia, Buesines process improvement: &lsquo;conservative&rsquo; change programmes, IT Driven Change, Mainting the Status Quo; Failure to &lsquo;Re-engineer&rsquo; <span>Human</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>Resources, Organisational Transformation. </p>

<h3>Project Initiation</h3>

<p>The case studies demonstrate that the <span>impetus</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>for initiatives <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to come from senior management at the &lsquo;executive&rsquo; level. Responsibility for the BPR programmes is then delegated to a lower tier of management.   At Midland University, a project stake-holding team was appointed by the executive Steering Group for the project, consisting of  a senior administrative manager from an academic department, a financial accounting manager from <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>administration, an information services manager representing the Library, an IT manager representing <span>Computing</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>Services and the Administrative Secretary.   Similar teams were <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>at the other case study institutions  so as to <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the various functional areas within their HEI.   Senior management at Midland set the <span>parameters</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>for change as being  a commitment to identifying means for more effective and efficient management of administrative support processes.   At NWU the project <span>parameters</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>were broader to include possible redesign of <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning processes.   The purpose of <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>interdisciplinary teams to work on the projects is two-fold:  first, the team members could take an overall <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of their particular area;  secondly, the members of the team would be able to consult widely with the various groups of people involved in the process, to gain a diagnosis of the <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>Wide Consultation</h3>

<p>Consultation within the institution is conducted at all levels of the organisation with clerical, managerial, academic, and technical staff, as well as with <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   This enables <span>mapping</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of core processes and identification of the <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and functions involved.   In an attempt to understand information handling within different functions an information audit is carried out.   In the case of the Student Record Process at Highland University, the questions asked related to where information for fulfilment of a given task was obtained from, why it was required, when and how it was required.   The whole student record and associated information was looked at, starting with the student&rsquo;s initial enquiry about applying to the university, through to graduation.   Such an analysis helps determine the information requirements, which, in such a complex institution, are difficult to deduce.   Individuals would not always understand why they performed a certain task: this possibly indicated redundant activities that could be <span>eliminated</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in a BPR change project.   One of the aims of consulting widely was to create a sense of employee ownership of the change in the process.   At Midland:</p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;although it was top-down initiated, it was bottom-up in the way it developed...we had a lot of people from departments coming to our workshops - so they felt they had input... (and) took an ownership of that process&rsquo;, (Informant interview)</blockquote>

<p>In the case of Yorkshire,<i> </i>the input of departments was seen as being in their interests, given the fact that they control their own budgets:  reduced costs for administration would mean more resources for <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning.   The<i> </i>NEU 
                        approach is different, in that, initially, the team leader&rsquo;s experience in student administration guided process review, rather than any formal consultation.   However, as the process change got underway it became apparent that the involvement of departments was necessary and a &lsquo;user group&rsquo; consisting of users of the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>student database in departments was set up.   This has <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>crucial for precise determination of departmental requirements.   Employee involvement is <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in the HEI <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>where change is generally <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>through consensus (<a href="#ref">Brown, 1997</a>).   When a decentralised management structure exists, autonomous departments in the HEI have to be convinced of the value of a re-engineering programme:</p>

<blockquote>'Academic managers in Schools  - as far as I can see -  are very powerful and you can&rsquo;t really put a new system in that they wouldn&rsquo;t buy into&rsquo; (Informant Interview, NWU).</blockquote></i><p><a href="#ref4">Penrod and Dolence</a> (1992) argue that processes must be more customer-orientated in Higher Education.   However, this would <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>change for University administration, and processes seem likely to remain service-provider orientated.   At NWU the Team Leader con0ers that services should be customer orientated, but the tendency with consultation was to examine processes from the provider&rsquo;s point of view.   At NEU the devolution of certain administrative functions to department level was <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to bring services closer to the student, but the project seems to have been little informed by student consultation.   The needs of the service providers have been given most examination.   The Team Leader at NWU argues that the transformation team looking at &lsquo;student acquisition&rsquo;: </p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;...came up

<p>In the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>stages the HEI <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>tended to have external input from management consultants.   At NWU where the aim is to radically change processes, consultants worked with senior management on corporate strategy, pointing the executive towards successful BPR efforts undertaken in a number of United States HEIs.   By <span>comparison</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> at Midland University there was a more <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>form of support from the consultants:  the team had not previously been involved with BPR, so the consultants trained them in usage of BPR techniques and <span>tools</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> rather than in linking processes to overall <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy.   An informant  at Highland, was of the opinion that the consultants they brought in did not have <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>understanding of the organisational climate of his institution for providing valuable input:</p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;I

<h3>Senior Management Approval</h3>

<p>Consultation and analysis, enables process review teams to formulate an agenda for change and project recommendations.   However, although the project stakeholding team may be given license to make recommendations on the basis of its consultation and analysis of the existing <span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> implementation of these proposals is another matter.   As an informant at Midland finds:</p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;...we totally lacked support from senior management...There was a willingness to set it (the BPR programme) up in the first place, but after that it was never seriously on the agenda.&rsquo; (Informant Interview, Midland).</blockquote>

<p>A <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of commitment seems to have been responsible for an earlier <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>attempt to re-engineer the University of Yorkshire&rsquo;s administration.   Senior management backing and support is required, but equally there has to be buy-in <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the organisation.   The HEIs in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>conformed to the organisational structure identified by <a href="#ref4">Taylor</a> (1995), where management structures are decentralised - albeit to varying degrees.   The conservative outlook of senior management at Midland, could be viewed as a reflection of the institution as a whole:  they understand the autonomous nature of the various departments and services and do not wish (or feel able) to disrupt the existing <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   The managerial structure does not allow for the &lsquo;dictation&rsquo; of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>from the senior managment as the departments  has <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>power to check the <span>powers</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of the top management.</p>

<h3>Complex Information Requirements</h3>

<p>The diagnostic processes carried out by each case study HEI, revealed that administrative support services draw on diverse sources of information, and that departments generally run their own independent databases in <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>databases.   As a result, university information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>are fragmented.   Systems are started off in the centre for <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>such as accounting:  they do not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>meet departmental requirements.   Differences between departments dictate that departments will manage their own data, for their own <span>purposes</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   <i>Ad hoc</i> 
                        developments to <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>are undertaken in an attempt to meet these &lsquo;other&rsquo; needs, but such uncoordinated <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>lead to &lsquo;system mess&rsquo;.   For instance at NWU the existing Student Information System: </p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;grew up in bits, initially meeting the requirements of <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>Registry...then access was made available to other areas - but they didn&rsquo;t <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>or have input into it.   You end up with a mess.&rsquo; (Informant Interview, NWU).</blockquote></i><p>While the <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>may be <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the interests of one group of users, problems <span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>because Universities have a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of user groups with differing information requirements. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>further significant problem is <span>duplication</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> which is created by departments running their own <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>along 0e <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   As with Highland, where departments had been keeping exam results on departmental databases, printing these out and forwarding to <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>administration, who then had to re-type results into a <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>database.   At NEU<i> </i>the Team Leader comments: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;...people in departments were constantly sending messages to the centre on bits of paper, e-mails and whatever&quot; (Informant Interview, NEU).</blockquote>

<p>Work is done more than once creating great inefficiencies.   <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>BPR effort will face the <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>an &lsquo;integrated&rsquo; information system, within which data capture is undertaken at one point.   Apart from the <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>involved with determining diverse user information needs and meeting them all, the BPR initiative has to ensure that centralised <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>are used.   This is a question of providing different <span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of the university with what they <span>require</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   The change is related to culture in that it becomes necessary for departments to operate in a more <span>uniform</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>manner.   However, attaining agreement on what a process should constitute is problematic.   In the process evaluation at Midland University, financial process recommendations conflicted with those covered by student administration: </p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;The Student 
                            Administration project workers just went off and said, &lsquo;we&rsquo;re going to do all this (the recommendations) with the new student administration system we&rsquo;re developing, so lets just bear that in mind as we do that&rsquo;&rsquo; (Informant Interview, NEU).</blockquote>

<p>Any agenda for change in the complex HEI will struggle to achieve a coherent and co-ordinated set of recommendations. An informant at<i> </i>NWU commented:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;...we&rsquo;ve got several rival administrative frameworks in the university and they are not working together&quot; (Informant Interview, NWU).</blockquote>

<h3>Institutional Politics &amp; Entrenched Values</h3>

<p>The HEI case studies <span>possess</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>a 
                        significant (although varying) amount of &lsquo;historical baggage&rsquo;, so that working <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>can be out-dated and fail to add value.   Some <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>exist <span>purely</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to check the work of others.   The process analysis at NEU revealed many &lsquo;working committees&rsquo; and different functional layers of responsibility for authorisation.   Completion of administrative tasks was a <span>complicated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>process, but various rubber stamping activities were found to be unnecessary obstacles to process completion.   Johnson&rsquo;s (1992) organisational culture &lsquo;paradigm&rsquo;  - the core set of <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>by employees (&lsquo;the way we do things around here&rsquo;) -  is demonstrated to be a powerful factor in the case study HEIs.   The current processes and <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>appear to be inextricably linked with the cultural paradigm:  organisational structures and functions are entrenched in these institutions, and BPR is bound to <span>conflict</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>with a few <span>traditions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>when it is <span>introduced</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p><a href="#ref">Dobson and McNay</a> (1996) posit that many interest groups exist in HEIs;  this is borne out by analysis of the case studies.   &lsquo;Interest groups&rsquo; of <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>strength are individual departments.   The cultural paradigm is further <span>complicated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>by the fact that individual departments often have their own cultures and operate on an autonomous basis.   <a href="#ref4">Slee</a> (1995) con0ers that a TQM initiative in his department, succeeded because the philosophy underpinning the approach was in tune with the existing staff value system.   It has to be noted that this was implemented within a single department;  achieving alignment with the core <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of departments institution-wide is less feasible given the <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in cultures between departments.   It is not simply a question of negotiating one organisational culture when implementing change:  thereis  a multiplicity of cultures.   This was most apparent in the long-established Highland University, but also evident in the newer NWU.   As a New University, NWU might be <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to have a more managerial structure than institutions such as Midland and Highland, but that has to be weighed against the &lsquo;polytechnic culture&rsquo; which still influences NWU.   The &lsquo;polytechnic culture&rsquo; describes a series of independent Schools where different cultures apply.  An informant at NWU con0ers that managing the University&rsquo;s 15 Academic Schools as a single <span>entity</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> is somewhat improbable given that there would be a 15-1 reporting relationship:  each School is in <span>possession</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of a powerful Head of School.   In a large HEI such as Yorkshire, there is inevitably going to be a significant level of autonomy at the departmental level: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;You have to accept a quite significant <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of autonomy...they have legitimate reasons in many cases for doing things differently&quot; (Informant Interview, Yorkshire).</blockquote>

<p>For instance, Medical Schools 
                        have <span>complicated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>funding relationships with the NHS.   Academic <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>were described in different institutions variously as &lsquo;fiefdoms&rsquo; (Highland), &lsquo;cottage industries&rsquo; (Midland) and &lsquo;independent islands&rsquo;(NWU).</p>

<p>At Midland, there is a binary system of reporting so that managers have control over a specific function (e.g, Bursar - Finance).   An informant from Midland<i> </i> doubts the logic of this:  research is a core area of Midland&rsquo;s <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>yet it is split under the control of two functions.   This informant argues that it would make more sense to have a Director of Research to co-ordinate all research administration activities.   <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>BPR programme strives to achieve such streamlining of activities, but it would involve a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>restructuring, something unlikely to receive the necessary backing given that it threatens the <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of those it needs to have support from.   As <a href="#ref5">Willmott</a> (1995) would put it:  turkeys do not vote for Christmas.</p>

<h3>Academic Freedom</h3>

<p>The professional <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of academics is an important <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of the organisational culture in the case study HEIs.   There is an <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>on academic freedom, and this is as much a <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of the new university in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>(NWU) as the others.   The notion of academic freedom is ever present.   An informant at NWU points to the analogy that managing academics is like trying to herd cats - it is a near <span>impossible</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>task as they all have <span>minds</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of their own, and go off in different directions.   Thus,  an attempt to re-engineer <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning  - planned in NWU -  is likely to be undermined by the unclear accountabilities within <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning.   Powerful academic management has to be convinced of the benefits of change;  any restructuring of the organisation is likely to be viewed as an encroachment.   For instance,  at NWU, managerial hierarchies are just not recognised in the same way as they might be in the private sector:  academics are as likely to identify with fellow academics in the same <span>discipline</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in another institution, as they are with a management structure in their own department.</p>

<p>Attempts to radically change <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning through BPR  - enhancing development of  resource and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>based learning -  is a threat to the individualistic, customised learning <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>by individual academics.   <a href="#ref2">Hall and White</a> (1997) argue that a barrier to introducing more IT-based <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>is the fact that academics seek to individualise <span>teaching</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> Successful re-engineering of <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>a massive cultural change.   Three of the case study HEIs (NWU, Yorkshire, NEU) seek a <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of  <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning process transformation, but attempts to change administrative processes are far better developed.   At NWU it is recognised that there is an essence to <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning that should remain intact following any redesign:  the <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>being to <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>this and change radically.   An informant at NWU commented: </p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;You 
                            don&rsquo;t want to throw away what academics do best.   The experience so far is that in the short <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>it is easier to achieve change in the administrative areas rather than the learning areas.   The academics need to want to do it as <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to the administrative areas where there is rather a greater discretion over how it is made to happen&rsquo;.</blockquote>

<p>This is in keeping with <a href="#ref2">Hall and White&rsquo;s</a> (1997) contention that the technological issues associated with <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>based learning are easier to overcome than the cultural issues.   <i>An informant at </i>NEU put forward 
                        the viewpoint is that any changes in <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning support will have to come from individual academics &quot;(its) to do with the initiative of the individual lecturer I would have thought&quot;. Yorkshire&rsquo;s approach is one that aims to: &lsquo;gently re-engineer teaching&rsquo; (Informant interview Yorkshire).</p>

<p>Traditional <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>methods remain  <i>despite</i> any technological innovation.   Attempts to radically redesign <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in a broad sweeping change seem to be unrealistic;  the academic culture of the institution favours gradual (and non-coercive) persuasion: </p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;It's a carrot rather than a stick...the more people see other people using it (the technology) and being successful, the more they will want to use it.&rsquo; (Informant interview, Yorkshire)</blockquote>

<p>The <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>is understanding <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>how the tutor contributes to the learning process:  all that is known is that many academics are adept at helping <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>understand.   Unless this <span>abstract</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>concept of &lsquo;helping to learn&rsquo; becomes <span>understood</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>programs will not effectively displace the academic <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>role.   <a href="#ref5">Willmott</a> (1993) views organisational culture as a potential <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of strength within organisations.   The case study HEIs perhaps realise that the &lsquo;human&rsquo; element of their institution is a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of competitive advantage, and are striving to <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and consolidate it despite the pressure for change.</p>

<h3>Inertia</h3>

<p>Insularity and a reluctance to change is a barrier for BPR to counter.   <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>financial accounting manager at Midland argues: &lsquo;There is a tremendous insularity and unwillingness to look at benchmarks.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In addition to the diverse and unclear accountabilities in the HEIs, a further problem is the inertia present within the case study material. This inertia is a by-product of years of successful provision of higher education: the question asked in the face of change is  &lsquo;why change something that has worked for so long?&rsquo;.   For instance one of  Highland&rsquo;s <span>Computing</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>staff finds that,  in such an institution inertia <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to prevent the removal of redundant <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   At NEU, it was<i> </i>argued that the ground-work for the project of widening access to the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>student database (to departments), was in fact best <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>without departmental involvement: &lsquo;In the early stages we knew the job that had to be done.   We have a tradition of <span>mutual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>suspicion between (central) administration and departments which is not helpful&rsquo;.</p>

<p>A respondent an NEU<i> </i> con0ers that this suspicion would have got in the way of any <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>changes, if departments had been involved from the start.   <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>informant<i> </i> at Midland comments: </p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;We produced 
                            a report of recommendations...(but) its very difficult to get people&rsquo;s <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in the University; maybe a report wasn&rsquo;t hard hitting enough&rsquo;.</blockquote>

<p>Senior management <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to acknowledge the importance of the recommendations and the core BPR programme did not really materialise.   The Higher Education market may be becoming more competitive, but the implications of this are only partially felt by its members.   Insularity and inertia breed an attachment to the existing organisation in a HEI such as Highland.   Change is <span>opposed</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> and territories and empires are defended.   Such a culture supports incremental change: </p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;...any 
                            change in the culture is a gradual process and it gradually builds up critical mass and initially those in the know are in the minority &quot;odd&quot;.   But as it builds a critical mass, then those that don&rsquo;t know become odd.&rsquo; (Informant interview, Highland)</blockquote>

<p>The intention at Yorkshire is largely to streamline <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>such as the Student Record system, bringing in a single powerful sodtware tool with access for departments through a distributed <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   BPR theory suggests that unless &lsquo;organisational pain&rsquo; is felt  - employee realisation of a precarious <span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> which <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>radical change if it is to be negotiated . <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>cultural change is a <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of any successful BPR initiative, but in these case study HEIs the changes in culture required for radical change go against the grain.   In any organisation the wrench felt by an effort to re-engineer the organisation is great.   Incremental change is more appropriate in the HEI <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> as it entails minimal disruption to the organisation&rsquo;s cultural paradigm.   For this reason, radical change through BPR is not a <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>at Midland, Highland, NEU and Yorkshire.   Instead the project teams have been set up by senior management, who motivated by a realisation that administrative costs are too high, expect the teams to identify best management <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>for administration.   Re-engineering concepts are used - <span>mapping</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of processes and analysis to identify process and information system requirements.   The motivation behind these aims can best be described as &lsquo;business process improvement&rsquo;(Informant, Highland).   By no means radical aims, the <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>here is on achieving best practice and co-ordinating activities: </p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s about <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>ways to do things better.   To eliminate redundant processes, to think through what it is you are doing.&rsquo; (Informant interview, Midland)</blockquote>

<p>Such moderate aims are partially linked to the fact that these <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>are performing well:  why undergo radical, risky change programmes if <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>is good?   These moderate aims are also linked to the structure of the organisation, where achieving change across the institution is problematic, given the presence of autonomous departments and a decentralised management structure.   Thus,  pragmatic improvements are striven for:  project stake-holding teams look at current activities and apply BPR techniques to determine how these can be improved.   At Highland, the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>for best practice has led to a <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>on promoting information sharing within the University.   This involves a form of cultural change, demonstrating to people that the information they <span>hold</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>can be of use to others: </p>

<p>An informant at Highland was of the opinion that non-sharing of information is not particularly a power related issue,  but represents a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of realisation that others can benefit from the information that people <span>hold</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   Midland had produced  recommendations that would radically change administrative processes, but as the gains to be made seemed out of proportion to the upheaval that would result from implementation, the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>BPR programme was rejected by senior management.   An informant at<i> </i> Midland argued that what has <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>happened, is elements of  the proposed BPR have been taken and applied to various projects, such as the restructuring of research administration:</p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;BPR has officially ended if you like, but an awful lot of people have used the potential of the recommendations to justify or support other changes&rsquo;.</blockquote>

<h3>IT- Driven Change</h3>


<p>At Midland and Highland, the <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>scope of the projects means that BPR is only a component of what is going on in terms of change within the institutions.   For instance, at Midland, improvement of the Student Record process is a stand-alone project.   Informants from Midland indicated that<i> </i> change through BPR is not even occurring at Midland.   Recommendations that had been flagged up as IT-related changes are broadly happening, but these are not co-ordinated by a single BPR strategy.   For instance Midland is seeking to reduce in real terms the levels of support staff, using the capabilities of IT to operate under the reduced levels: </p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;There is an <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>that <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>will change, but there is no tool apart from the technology being used.   Associated changes in people skills might be <span>expected</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> but won&rsquo;t happen.&rsquo; (Informant interviewt, Midland).</blockquote>

<p>This is clearly not a radical programme of BPR to transform the organisation.   Head-count <span>reduction</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>programmes are going on in both Highland and Midland, but these are described as <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>initiatives and not connected to BPR.   Re-engineering administrative processes is not <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>linked to either institution&rsquo;s <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy.   Instead the aim is to improve administrative effectiveness so that more effort can be concentrated on the core <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> learning and research.   In keeping with the pressures from the organisation&rsquo;s culture and the resultant reluctance to change, the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>is on process improvement through incremental change.   The approach is not the revolutionary change created by <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>process re-engineering, but a more evolutionary tinkering with existing processes.   At Highland the intention is to utilise existing information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to best effect, encouraging a more information sharing <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   NEU is also <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>current information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>as its starting point;  the change is in the widening of access to the student <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>database.   In fact this is not indicative of a redesign of responsibilities for many members of departmental staff:  they were already collecting and manipulating the same student data for their own databases.</p>


<h3>Maintaining the Status Quo</h3>

<p>Failure to 
                        &lsquo;Re-engineer&rsquo; <span>Human</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>Resources NWU is bringing in a University-wide document management system.   Programmers have developed the required <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>for this project, so that if academics have &lsquo;work&rsquo; on <span>Microsoft</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>Word or Powerpoint, these <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>can be <span>translated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>into an electronic format with all Web <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>developed automatically. NWU&rsquo;s view is that this is likely to succeed because it is meeting academics &lsquo;where they are now&rsquo;, rather than persuading them to change.   It is very much about fitting in with the <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>quo.   There is initial suspicion  - as <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to exist between departments and the centre -  and <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>that the centre is off-loading <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>work to departments.   <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>informant at<i> </i>NEU finds it is often a question of offering &lsquo;sweeteners&rsquo; to departmental staff, in order to persuade them to accommodate to changes.   For example, they have programmed in a mail-merge facility on the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>student database which acts as a time-saver in departments: </p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;Whether it is strategically useful or whatever, (departmental administrators) benefit personally:  it may not fit with the information strategy but its not just about that, its also about the whole morale of staff and lots of things hang on this&rsquo;.</blockquote>

<p>This can be seen as an attempt to support the existing individualistic culture of departments.</p>

<p>Problems <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>when changes in working <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>are necessary.   The IT changes at Midland are <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to bring about associated efficiencies, but these are uncoordinated projects.   The problem with a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of different projects is that technological changes will <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in a vacuum.   Information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>changes are about changing the way people work:  human resources change is vital (<a href="#ref">DeLisi, 1990</a>).   An informant<i> 
                        </i>recognises that Yorkshire has not really done enough to facilitate the fact that departmental administrators will need to acquire new skills: </p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;We 
                            haven&rsquo;t done what we should.   I think its <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to dawn on quite a lot of departmental administrators that it&rsquo;s going to <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>quite an additional burden...there is some nervousness about that.&rsquo;</blockquote>

<p>The <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of human resources change planning is partly attributed to the complexity of the <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   Each resource centre (department) within the University is different, so that some departments are devolving work to secretaries, whilst others are devolving to quite high level administrators.   The &lsquo;centre&rsquo; is not particularly well placed to negotiate the different requirements of departments:  negotiating human resources change is being left to the departmental level.   The problem will be that departments might fail to manage the change effectively:  staff will not be prepared to meet the new challenges.</p>

<p>In the case study HEIs, the autonomy of departments and diverse cultures, largely results in a compromise between BPR theory and what can be <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in the particular restrictions of the HE environment:  it is &lsquo;watered down change&rsquo;.   BPR is off set by institutional complexity;  that is the information requirements, academic politics and associated cultural barriers to implementing organisational change.   Achieving co-ordination of the disparate - but nonetheless interdependent - information sources is an immensely difficult task given the diversity of section <span>concerns</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>Organisational Transformation</h3>

<p>NWU are rather more radical at the outset of their initiative, constructing a broad agenda for organisational change through BPR.   Organisational cultural factors experienced in the other <span>universities</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> such as academic freedom, and a decentralised management structure, are still significant factors for those implementing process review in this institution.   The fact that this HEI aims for change of a radical nature seems to be related to top management evaluation of the financial <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   This HEI is having to face up to significant financial problems:  it has managed to budget for the next financial year, but then has to undergo significant cost-cutting initiatives.   NWU&rsquo;s executive visited a number of US HEIs and discovered that BPR could be used to manage the effects of cost-cutting. The financial <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>at NWU has opened the door for a radical re-engineering programme:  executive backing is present (at least in the early stages of the project), and the teams charged with process review have a wide remit for change.   The agenda for change is all encompassing, outlining how all areas of the university could be transformed to advance organisational effectiveness.   Determining precisely how change should be managed is another matter, although there is recognition of the limitations of an approach that involves tinkering with existing processes:  new processes are to be implemented.   An infomant at NWU<i> </i>stresses the necessity of going back to basics and determining what the &lsquo;root and branch&rsquo; needs are for a process.   There has been too much adding to what already exists and not removing redundant practices: </p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;People 
                            don&rsquo;t know why they are doing things - if you ask why they are doing something, you get some very funny answers...there is an awful lot of window-dressing&rsquo;.</blockquote>

<p>Re-centralisation of <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>is also seen as a necessary requirement, to achieve the necessary <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of information <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   For this to happen this informant was aware that a cultural change has to <span>occur</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   Also,  the information requirements of different <span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>are diverse, making <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>a difficult <span>proposition</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   Currently, bids to re-engineer administrative processes are the most developed, whilst plans to redesign learning and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>are somewhat less clear.   This is an indication of the <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>associated with applying BPR to <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning.</p>

<p>At NWU, this informant takes the approach of modelling what the process in question would ideally look like, and then identifies how it could exist in the &lsquo;real world&rsquo;.   This represents a similar philosophy to that of <a href="#ref2">Grint</a> (1995) who con0ers BPR to be a utopia to work towards, even though it is unlikely to be arrived at.   <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>compromise has to be <span>reached</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>between the organisational circumstances in existence, such as cultural and political factors, and the process model.   NWU has to negotiate a powerful academic management structure of departments who expect to manage themselves:  consensus change is required.   Thus there are significant problems faced in implementing BPR.   However, having made the point about the necessity for achieving change through consensus, there is an element of urgency for NWU to change.   This means that gradually attaining consensus over a long <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of time is not a viable option.   <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>different informant at NWUadmits:</p>

<blockquote>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m 
                            not sure that there will be en mass support (from academics), but this is where the Provost as academic leader of the institution has to come in.   It can&rsquo;t evolve <span>naturally</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>just with those people who want to make it happen, it has to happen rather more quickly than that&rsquo;.</blockquote>

<p>Whether or not full awareness of the fininacial <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>will convince people that radical changes are appropriate is open to question.   Certainly an element of  top down <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>will be necessary, but managing the tension this may create with the autonomous departments, is an important issue for con0eration.   The recommendations that have been made in the transformation report might demonstrate efficient managerial practice, but it could be that it is only awareness of the financial predicament that will provide the required <span>impetus</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>for change.</p>

<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>

<p>UK HEIs are under pressure to change.   This pressure comes from a  number of interrelated  factors: the <span>expansion</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of HE, a changing student profile, pressures from industry, increased competition and IT capability.  All  these factors seem to be driving HEIs seek managerial <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>for maintaining efficiency, effectiveness and economy under new circumstances.   Improvement of administrative, research, and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning activities are  seen as <span>essential</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   The case studies reveal that many of the HEIs have taken the view that before any redesign of <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning can be con0ered inefficiencies in administrative management must be addressed.   Process review teams at these institutions have identified that administrative information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and processes in these HEIs are fragmented and inefficient.   In the HEI <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> there is a necessity for both <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and departmental databases.   Departments tend to implement their own databases in <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span><span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> in order to meet individual departmental requirements.   However, as these departments are part of a single University, they have to have a link to <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>databases:  this presents many opportunities for <span>duplication</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of effort and work.   Against this background, the five HEI case studies are attempting to utilise a form of process change in order to become more efficient.   The aim is to become more process orientated and eliminate redundant, non-value adding practices;  the appeal of BPR is its <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>on utilising IT <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to link <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>processes that cut across functional boundaries.   BPR is seen as a means for addressing a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>where there might be around 50 departments, of which many function in different ways.   Re-engineering could ensure that <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>in these departments become more similar, and that departments work with an integrated information system.</p>

<p>Analysis of the interview data reveals what can best be described as &lsquo;business process improvement&rsquo; rather than radical redesign of processes.   Instead of total obliteration of existing processes, these institutions are focusing on improving administrative processes.   Establishing a integrated information system is a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>component of this, but the <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>is on widening access to existing <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> modifying these slightly to meet individual departmental requirements:  the initiatives are IT driven.   It is not simply a question of building information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>on the basis of user (department) demands.   The <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>re-engineering aims are prompted by the restrictive factors that initiators of change must negotiate.   Any re-engineering type programme implemented will be effected by the cultural, political and management structural factors it encounters in a HEI.   In formulating the recommendations, the HEIs consult widely to gain a diagnosis of the current <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   Staff input is <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>as change in Higher Education is attained through consensus.   However, consensus is most likely to be gained if the recommendations are broadly in <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>with the existing cultural paradigm.   Thus the recommendations <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the conservative nature of departments within a HEI.   Despite the fact that what is being implemented is not radical re-engineering, the projects face significant barriers to achieving change successfully.   BPR techniques and <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>might have something to offer these HEIs, in terms of the potential for creating a more efficient and coherent operation.   However, that potential has to be matched against the cultural and structural factors within HEIs.   Subsequently these factors are likely to further diminish the scope for change made in the recommendations stage, as the attempt is made to <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>implement the project.   NWU&rsquo;s BPR recommendations <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>a more radical approach, but there is recognition that the HEI <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of NWU might reduce the level of process change <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>undertaken.   There is a difference between how a process would ideally exist and how it will exist in the &lsquo;real world&rsquo;.   The intention might be to start completely anew, but the reality could <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>building on past <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   The case studies demonstrate the unique <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>present in the HE environment:  autonomous, powerful departmental <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and the notion of academic freedom.   Departments tend to have <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>autonomy and operate in individualistic ways - partly because there may be <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>reasons for them to do this, but also because through their history and development they have evolved in certain ways.   Departments install their own databases because <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>databases tend not to suffice for individual needs.   To a certain extent, differences will <span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>through <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>reasons:  for example Medical Schools have particular requirements relating to their close collaboration with the NHS.   Beyond such &lsquo;legitimate&rsquo; <span>grounds</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>for differentiation, these departments have developed different working <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>which are now <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and entrenched.   If process review reveals administrative functions to be overly <span>complicated</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span> with certain <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>existing <span>purely</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to check the work of others, then that does not mean removal of these is <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>straightforward.   HEIs have strong organisational cultures and the cultural paradigm is inextricably linked to existing <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>roles</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The problems faced when applying BPR techniques to administrative services are accentuated when applied to <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning.   With <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning, any redesign faces less clear accountabilities than is the case with administration.   The aims of administrative services are easier to identify than <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning aims:  the <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>outcomes of the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning process are more debatable.   Academic freedom is a hugely important issue when con0eration is given to redesign of <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning.   Academics tend to expect a certain amount of freedom to pursue the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>techniques they <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>most appropriate for their field of expertise.   When the case study HEIs are attempting to re-engineer <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning it represents a <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>form of change.   The <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>is on making learning support technology available to those academics that want it.   This is a &lsquo;bottom-up&rsquo; form of change in that it is down to the individual academic to implement changes if they <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>it will improve the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning process.   Academic freedom is such a powerful notion within the HEIs that changing <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning cannot be <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>attained without support from individual academics.   Thus an institution wide initiative to redesign learning and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>can only be a gradual, incremental process.   The <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>the essence of the academic&rsquo;s <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>role in <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning provision means that innovations <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>are used to supplement conventional methods.   At NWU the re-engineering of <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>is <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>to be of a more radical nature.   However, at the same time there is realisation that change must not detract from &lsquo;what academics do best&rsquo; (e.g. providing lectures).   The NWU project team acknowledge the importance of achieving change through consensus, but the urgency of the need for change  - a precarious financial <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>-  means that more gradual and incremental redesign is inappropriate:  a certain <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of top-down dictation is required.   This is likely to <span>prove</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>conflict</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>given that change in Higher Education is usually by consensus.</p>

<p>To conclude, the case study HEIs are for the most part implementing change programmes that <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>a fairly <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>approximation of BPR techniques.   These projects are not about radically changing the organisation by obliterating existing processes.   Instead it is process improvement;  more radical BPR projects will <span>conflict</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>with the organisational factors identified in this research.   In particular the power of academic departments, the professional <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>of academics and inertia within the HEIs make radical re-engineering an unlikely <span>proposition</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>   The experiences of the case study HEIs <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>that incremental process change may succeed in achieving modest efficiency gains, particularly when applied to administrative services.   Teaching and learning support <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>an even greater <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>on incremental change;  it is down to the individual academic to implement any changes.   However, the fact that these BPR projects are process and IT driven <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>dramatic service improvements will not be made:  insufficient <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:120px 40px 120px 40px;position:relative;">.</span>is given to the human resources 0e of change management.</p>

<h1>Back door entries, invisible ink, and false drops on the Web: an interim research note</h1>
<br>
<h4><a href="mailto:clb24@buffalo.edu ">Christopher Brown-Syed</a><br>
Visiting Assistant Professor<br>
Library &amp; Information Studies Department<br>
University at Buffalo, State University of New York<br>
Buffalo, New York 14260</h4>


<p>This note concerns two phenomena which are the subject 
of ongoing research at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, USA.
The overall aim of the current investigation is to 
identify header and text elements which will assist researchers in 
determining quickly the relevance, authenticity, and value of 
digital artifacts, as well as information about the credentials of
their creators. Specifically, we note two trends in Web access 
and design which would appear to have ramifications - one primarily 
for Web designers and another 
for information intermediaries, such as librarians and archivists.
We contend that the absence of editorial control, coupled with the 
alarming tendency toward deliberate skewing of Web search results
by profiteers, will stress network bandwidth resources, contribute to a crisis of confidence in the 
Internet, and if unchecked, may potentially have far reaching consequences for 
the growth of scientific and scholarly knowledge, and for its dissemination to the public..
We began this line of research with an analysis of Listserv&#174 traffic,
conducted in 1996 (<a href="#brow">Brown-Syed & Witzke, 1997</a>), and are currently 
investigating Usenet News postings and Web pages created by academics.</p>
<p>
Web designers spend a great deal of effort creating attractive and
useful home pages. However, preliminary analysis of server statistics
suggests that many users never see these pages, having arrived at 
individual documents on the server through other means.</p>
<p>
The two main ways in which people appear to arrive at individual
documents on Web sites are: 1) hot links from other Web pages,
and 2) through search engines. The topics of documents are 
more likely to be of importance than the site's Web page 
hierarchy. Almost no one comes in through the "front door", that
is by accessing the site's main menu and then following links to
individual pages. This should not surprise librarians or archivists.
People looking for print or AV material on particular topics rarely
know that topical directories of academic, public, and special library 
contents exist. However, given the lack of editorial control on the 
Net, where authors act as their own publishers, the consequences of 
arriving at specific items are more far reaching. While one can 
indeed tell much about 
a book by its cover and title page, or a film by its credits, 
Net authors' credentials, and hence the reliability 
of their utterances, must be determined by other means.</p>
<p>
If asked to locate information on Soft Systems Methodology, only someone
acquainted with its history would think of going to the University of 
Lancaster first. Instead, the user would probably try a subject keyword
search for that term.</p>
<p>
This phenomenon causes some unexpected results, both for users and 
for providers of information. For instance, in 1997, we discovered that 
the server at Wayne State University's medical library was most popular
for its alternative medicine pages. </p>
<p>
On a server in the Library and Information Science Program at Wayne,
we found that relatively few visitors were interested in LIS.
An article on the New World Information and Communications Order, 
written for the electronic journal <cite><a href="#libr">LIBRES</a></cite> in 1993, was mounted on 
the author's server in 1995. It receives several hundred hits a month,
and this situation has remained constant for at least a year. The 
material in the document is quite dated. What could account for its
popularity? </p>
<p>
Hot links to this page may be found at a journalism school in 
the United States, where the article appears on a course reading list.
A student page on obtaining cheap airline tickets was the most popular page
on the LIS server during 1997. It was hot-linked from a page at a 
medical faculty in Sweden.</p>
<p>
However, hot links account for far fewer hits than do search engines. 
Removing internal requests (those from IP numbers within the Wayne subdomains),
and backtracking requests to their sources, we find users arriving at the
server from around the globe, but few appear to be looking for information
about the Program and its courses.</p>
<p>
Within a 24-hour period in December, 1998, the <cite>LIBRES</cite> page was accessed by users
as far apart as Goteborgs Universitet in Sweden, a JANET subnetwork in Kent 
England, and the campus network at the University of Toronto in Canada.</p>
<p>
The article is academic, dated, somewhat pedantic, and concerns a topic of 
interest primarily in international development and communications studies.
In the case of items with broader appeal, the pattern of "back door" 
access is even more pronounced and demonstrable. For example, the author's 
server contains a page entitled "King Arthur" which was mounted
as an example of HTML coding for an Internet class in 1996. The material had 
originally been written as mere filler in order to 
demonstrate the use of certain HTML commands. </p>
<p>
Since then, it has consistently 
received hundreds of hits each month. Between December 2nd and 
December 7th, 1998, only 30 people visited the server's index page, 
and just 26 accessed pages about specific LIS courses. Meanwhile the King 
Arthur page was requested 118 times - despite
the fact that it contains little concrete information about that monarch. 
In fact, concerned with the number of hits, we modified the page to 
contain more relevant information during the summer of 1997. </p>
<p>
<img src="p58.gif" border=0 align=right hspace=4 
vspace=4 alt="AltaVista's answer to spamming">
Recently, search engine services such as AltaVista, have attempted to 
clamp down upon 
 the practice of "spamming" the Web by loading pages with misleading 
or repititious keywords. (<a href="#alta">AltaVista, 1999</a>). The service now includes a warning (photo) in its 
pages which allow submission of specific URLs to the index. However, since 
network spiders or robots periodically call at each Web site to update 
indexes automatically, it is possible, indeed probable, that some Web designers will not 
see nor heed warnings of this nature. </p>
<p>
In information retrieval theory (IR theory), successful searching is considered 
the result of 
balancing the <cite>recall</cite> of a retrieval set with its <cite>precision</cite>.
Recall is a measure of the number of items retrieved, and precision is a measure of 
the number of retrieved items which the searcher considers to be "in context". A "false drop" 
is an instance of the search term in the retrieval set,  which is "out of context", given 
the searcher's intentions.</p>
<p>
Librarians point to metadata as the cure for high recall and false drops
resulting from Web searches, but metadata alone will not prevent the recall of
spurious items or information of dubious content and quality. In fact, 
designers anxious to promote their clients' products are becoming quite
adept at loading the keyword fields with repetitions of certain words.
Much as small companies take names like "AAAA Towing" so as to have 
their names first in telephone directories, designers repeat keywords 
literally hundreds of times within the headers of documents. As well, some designers 
fill the bodies of their documents with hundreds of repeated words,
written in text which is the same color as the document's background. 
Words written in black against a black background are invisible to users,
but are indexed by search engines. It is the digital equivalent to writing 
in "invisible ink". To view the "secret" writing, all you need is a mouse, 
or knowledge of your browser's "View Document Source" option. </p>
<p>
The  page you are now reading contains text "invisible" to users but indexed by search engines. To view the hidden message, place your mouse directly below the words "Figure A", depress your left mouse button, and drag the mouse across the blank area which appears between the two horizontal lines.</p>

<p><hr><p>
We reported the use of this technique at the CAIS '98 conference in Ottawa (<a href="#brow2">Brown-Syed, 1998</a>).
It is now evidently in widespread use. While search engine robot programs
could "unique" the keyword field, indexing only one occurrance of each 
word, it would be difficult to apply a similar process to texts of documents 
themselves - to do so would defeat the assessment of document relevance,
 which is based upon the number of times a word appears in the body of 
the text, as well as in the document header. Words 
which appear legitimately in a document would be "uniqued away" along 
with the intentionally misleading repetitious ones.</p>
<p>
In a singular example of bad "netiquette", one site in the Netherlands
offering a <cite>Beginner's Guide to Internet</cite> opens with a page
containing 18 lines of explanatory notes (including HTML markup), followed by the words,
"The rest of this page is for the search engines", followed by 
some blank space, and 104 lines  of
repetitive keywords. These words appear in the same colour as the 
text - white, against a grey background. The designer would appear either 
to be 
unaware of the techniques for concealing keywords described above, or 
 to be encouraging the practice deliberately. The page
is signed only with the alias, "webmaster", rather than the with creator's
real name. </p>
<p>
Aside from constituting an incredible waste of bandwidth, the practice
skews users' searches, sometimes in unpredictable ways. 
One site distributing erotic pictures of entertainers has created an 
first page aptly entitled "words.htm". Of the 302 lines, and 19,692 bytes 
in this particular page, only 
one line is visible. It contains exactly 6 words, or 40 bytes of 
useful text.</p>
<p>
The rest of the page consists of hundreds of repetitions of concealed 
keywords.
The word "supermodel" occurs 155 times in the header and text, along 
with 169 combined occurances of the words "nude" and "naked", 
79 of the word "celebrity", 85 of the word "gay", and so forth. The 
names of several noted performers are also concealed in the 
header or against the background of the message body.</p>
<p>
Users seeking more conventional information about entertainers, 
will arrive at this site first, as its designers have intentionally skewed
its relevance ranking by including words like "celebrity". On some engines, 
even a search on a term as innocuous as "Canadian singer" or "Shania Twain" 
may point users first to sites containing risque photos. 
While this may be welcome news to 
people looking for erotica, it is annoying at best to researchers in a 
hurry to find information about world personalities.
Surprisingly, a recent search for another Canadian band, <cite>Barenaked Ladies</cite>, yielded
better results - most search engines consulted in December 1998 correctly retrieved 
information about the rock band, provided that the string "barenaked" was entered without
an internal space. In June 1998, the context had been almost universally misinterpreted, regardless 
of spacing.</p>
<p>
As with more conventional print and audio visual material, a knowledge of
the sources is invaluable for users of the Net. Experience teaches that
"sony.com" is a likely place to search for that production company's 
films and TV programs, and that the <cite>Internet Movie Database</cite> is a good 
source of filmoraphies. This sort of knowledge is more typically
the province of librarians and archivists than of members of the public
or, for that matter, of anyone searching for items outside their customary field of interest.
Until search engine software is developed to defeat the ethically 
questionable practice of "loading", false drops and high recall would 
appear to be inevitable on the Net.</p>

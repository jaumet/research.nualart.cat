<p>This issues was intended to be a special issue on 'virtual communities'; however, in spite of the efforts of Dr Lee Komito of University College, Dublin, our intended 'Issue Editor' the anticipated flood of papers did not materialise and, in the event, only two papers are concerned with that topic. However, we have two other papers on different topics and a Working Paper on something different again. The Working Paper was put together too late for review, hence its WP status. However, it may change its status after review. </p>

<p>The two papers on virtual communities are both from the University of Illinois, which has a very successful distance learning programme, which forms the background to both. First, Jenny Robins looks at, <A HREF="paper131.html">&quot;Affording a place: the role of persistent structures in social navigation&quot;</a>, which introduces the concept of &quot;social navigation&quot;, defined as &quot;...the way people use the activities of others to direct their own behaviour&quot;. In the next paper <a href="paper132.html">Karen Ruhleder</a> examines the 'affordances' of virtual space, that is, what the characteristics of virtual space allow, in terms of creating a 'community'.</p>

<p>Next, Kenneth Welsh and Helmut Schneider of Louisiana State University examine the <a href="paper129.html">role of motivation and risk behaviour</a> in the success of software development projects. Agency theory is employed and demonstrates that, &quot;Companies where employees have outcome-based contracts have more software project successes than companies where contracts are based on behaviour.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, in the refereed papers, Timothy Craven asks the question, <a href="paper130.html">What is the title of a Web page?</a> and explores the difficulties of cataloguing Web pages, concluding that the concept of the title is extremely vague in the case of Web pages. He advises cataloguers to use the 'apparent' title, which may be constructed from the information visible on the page, rather than using titles found in meta-tags.</p>

<p>The <a href="paper133.html">Working Paper</a> by Elena Macevi&#269;i&#363;t &#279; and myself (in my capacity as Visiting Professor at the H&ouml;gskolan i Bor&aring;s, Sweden) picks up on a paper I wrote almost fifteen years ago, which reviewed the state of research in information management at that time. This new review finds that the major changes have been in relation to networks and the Internet.</p>

<p>In addition to the papers, we have the usual selection of book reviews covering everything from cyber-crime to the concept of the paperless office.</p>

<p>With this issue we welcome some new members of the Editorial Board - take a look at: <a href="../editors.html">http://informationr.net/ir/editors.html</a></p>

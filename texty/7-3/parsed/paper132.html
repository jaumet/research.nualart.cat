(LEEP Student)</blockquote>
        
          <p>The Internet can be portrayed as either a <span>mechanism</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for bridging the boundaries of space and time, or as a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of isolation and alienation. The quest for creating on-line <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of one <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or another is the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of tremendous effort and <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in educational institutions, corporations, local <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>networks, the entertainment industry, etc. Whether for altruistic reasons or in the hope of financial reward, individuals and organizations are looking for ways in which to create electronic environments that enable and sustain on-line <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
        
          <p>As communication technologies become more accessible, participation in these electronic environments increasingly supplements or even supplants face-to-face encounters. Video-conferencing technologies are used in corporations to enable distributed groups to work together regularly without the need for frequent travel. On-line <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>conferences and chat rooms provide instructors and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>assistants with additional ways to post materials and interact with <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in large lecture <span>classes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> But do these technologies &quot;create community&quot;? Do they enable participants to engage in the kind of experience that gives them a sense of all working together on the task at hand? And what sustains these <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>over time, creating a sense of connection that is both <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>from and integrated with the physical settings, in which we live and work? In short, what makes a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>workable for its participants?</p> 
        
         <p>A sense of connection and engagement thrives in part through the creation of a sense of presence (<a href="#lom97">Lombard &amp; Ditton, 1997</a>). Video conferencing, for instance, tries to make us feel as though people on the other 0e of the link are in the room with us. In contrast, many on-line gaming environments <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>instead on creating a <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><i>virtual</i> space that makes participants feel as though they are somewhere else. Connection is also fostered through informal collaboration between members of the virtual <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> In <a href="#bru98">Bruckman</a> (1998), participants in a MOO construct their virtual <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>through informal <span>interactions</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> sometimes leading to the development of rich and complex on-line <span>spaces</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> MOO-based learning communities can be actively and successfully developed to support rich informal learning through the affordances that they provide (<a href="#oda98">O'Day, <em>et al.</em>, 1998</a>). On-line venues can extend face-to-face models of <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> such as apprenticeship learning (<a href="#lev98">Levin &amp; Waugh, 1998</a>) and the master class format of the arts (<a href="#ruh00">Ruhleder &amp; Twidale, 2000</a>).</p> 
        
          <p>This paper contributes to the work of a diverse set of researchers who are seeking to understand what makes some of these on-line endeavours more successful than others, and who are working to develop a shared <span>vocabulary</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>through which we can share and analyze our experiences. This paper examines one particular distributed educational <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> analyzed through a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>proposed by <a href="#myn98">Mynatt, <em>et al.</em></a> (1998) for evaluating the affordances of a <i>network <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></i> Below, I describe the <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>upon which I draw.

 <blockquote>&quot;I get to live my life where I want to. I wasn't going to go anywhere else, I was staying in [major city]. This means [private institution] was my only option.

Instructor: &quot;I wanted to build a little bit on the discussion question this week. You guys did a really great job on posting on the question of motivation.

<p> The <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> meanwhile, continue their own discussion via the chatroom while the instructor is speaking:</p>

 &lt;S2&gt; <span>Sometimes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>we have to rely on others' internal motivation. If that's not there, there's not

        <p>Class Web conferences provide forums for posting class-related URLs, administrative information, reviews of related readings, etc. Additionally, School-wide Web conferences offer a &quot;virtual commons&quot; for posting announcements, general information, and technical updates. Although most <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>within the programme  are on-line, the initial on-campus orientation session

        <p> Below, I address aspects of the LEEP that helps <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>cope with or overcome a complex set of academic, technical, and emotional issues. LEEP is representative of an increasing number of venues in
 which technologies enable people to intertwine real and virtual activities as they work towards some goal. It serves as the field site for several studies of on-going study of networked <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> including
 Haythornthwaite (<a href="#hay98">1998</a>, <a href="#hay00">2000</a>) and <a href="#hayet00">Haythornthwaite, <em>et al.</a></em> (2000). </p>

					<p>The observations in this paper come from a year-long study which included participant observation of on-campus events, review of chat room and audio broadcast logs, and interviews with instructors, staff and <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Before conducting observations or using any on-line data (such as class logs), I posted information about the study on a general announcements WebBoard read by all members of the LEEP <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>  I then obtained permission from individual instructors to &quot;observe&quot; their live <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and access  the archived class logs, contingent upon willingness of the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to be studied.  I next posted information about the project and methods on the class WebBoards.  No data were collected without first giving <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>a chance to read about the project, contact the instructor or researcher with questions, and withhold their consent.  Any time I &quot;observed&quot; a class in real-time, my name would show up on the <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of chat participants.  And, of course, any <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>who where interviewed gave consent prior to the interview itself.  This fieldwork is outlined in more detail in 
<a href="#ruh99">Ruhleder</a> (1999).

        <h2>Modeling on-line community</h2>
    
		<p><a href="#myn98">Mynatt, <em>et al.</em></a>, (1998) <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>three broad, defining <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of community: that <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is based on a <i>bounded, small-scale set of relationships;</i> that these relationships be <i>meaningful and multi-layered;</i> and that communities themselves are <i>dynamic and always under development.</i> They further <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that one lens for the analysis of <span>network</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> or on-line, <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is the notion of <i>affordance.</i> In the most general terms, affordances are properties of physical environments that support or constrain various forms of social <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> <a href="#gib77">Gibson</a> (1977) <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>term</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> arguing that people perceive the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in terms of the actions it suggests and enables.</p>

    <p> Designers and architects work to create artefacts and <span>spaces</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that will <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>certain <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of uses to people, and <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>developers try to draw on lessons from the physical world to create virtual space that will be <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>navigable. For instance, when we attach something to a door that is <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>graspable (such as a handle or knob), the artefact makes it easy to pull open the door. Other door sgive us a flat, broad surface that makes it easier to push the door open. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>specific affordance can be either positive or negative from the point of view of the human user, depending on his or her <span>purposes</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> For example, the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of social context cues in text-based media such as e-mail can both be an asset and a detriment, depending on the nature and purpose of a given <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
	  
    <p>In the case of on-line communities, the notion of affordances gives us a way of talking about technical and social arrangements that support certain <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>while discouraging or precluding others. <a href="#myn98">Mynatt, <em>et al.</em></a>, (1998) <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of five affordances of on-line communities that span technologies and types of use in the Internet-based communities which they studied:</p>

    <ul>
<li><i>Persistence,</i> in that these communities are  &quot;durable across time, users and particular uses,  providing an ambient and continuous context for  activity.&quot;</li>

<li>  <i>Periodicity,</i> is &quot;established and communicated  through a variety of rhythms and patterns&quot; within virtual  and physical <span>worlds</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></li>
<li>  <i>Boundaries,</i> <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>through &quot;mutually  <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>differentiation of <span>units</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> from single to  multiple, from proximate to remote.&quot;</li>
<li>  <i>Engagement,</i> in which &quot;the social rhythm and  <span>density</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of engagement necessary for community-building,&quot;  is enabled through diverse ways of coming together.</li>

<li>  <i>Authoring,</i> in which participants are able to &quot;use  and manipulate their space, whether as designers or  users,&quot; through a broad <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of flexible <span>interactions</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></li>
    </ul>
	
    <p>In the <span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>below, this set of affordances is used to frame the arrangements, agreements, opportunities and limitations which emerge as defining <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the LEEP programme when viewed through this lens.</p>

			<p>Of course, referring to LEEP as a &quot;community&quot; carries with it a number of folk assumptions about communities generally: that they cooperative, cohesive <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in which participants
work together to achieve a shared goal.  The public face of LEEP also suggests that the current on-campus programme already provides a form of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> faculty and staff.
The first paragraph on the '<a href="http://www.lis.uiuc.edu/gslis/degrees/leep.html">About LEEP</a>' page of the School Web site reads:</p>

		
		<blockquote>&quot;For a variety of personal reasons, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>who want to attend our well-regarded <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are not always able to relocate to campus. We extend our <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to them, and <em>widen our sense of <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></em> through our distance learning scheduling option called LEEP.&quot;
(emphasis added)</blockquote>
		
		<p>Communities also have their points of tension.  In LEEP, for instance, decisions made with respect to technical infrastructure may shape faculty choices	in terms of course organization.  Faculty expectations for on-line participation may be quite different from student expectations  Students
come to the programme from vastly different <span>backgrounds</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and may find the diversity stimulating or annoying.  These points of <span>conflict</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>can never be  resolved and this paper does not do them justice, though they are embedded in some of the discussion below.  However, this <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>offers us one 
way to to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>what makes LEEP &quot;usable&quot; to the participants, that is, how the <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the on-line <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>created by the LEEP staff intersect with the goals and work <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of LEEP participants even given the <span>inherent</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>tensions and inadequacies of LEEP as a &quot;community.&quot; </p>
    

<h2>Application of the model to LEEP</h2>

<h3>The affordance of persistence</h3>

<p>&quot;Persistence&quot; <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to the aspects of a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that are durable across &quot;time, users and particular uses.&quot; Many LEEP <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>take <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>part-time, meaning that they have <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>contact with the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in any given semester. The persistence of technologies, resources, and common work <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>provides a sense of continuity in their personal experience. The first year of LEEP saw significant changes in technologies and on-line resources. LEEP began by using a MOO to support <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>between <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and instructors. The following year saw the adoption of the current <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of audio and chat. The look, feel and functionality of both the chat room and the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>conferences have evolved over time.</p>

   <p>Since that first year, however, the <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>within LEEP <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and across the programme as a whole have remained <span>constant</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Additionally, a durable set of LEEP-wide resources has emerged, their consistency of format maintained by the technical staff and consistency of use maintained through emergent work <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> For instance, class Web pages have a consistent &quot;look and feel,&quot; and most instructors follow the now common practice to begin a new conference for each new week or unit of the course and to <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>conference for announcements and course <span>business</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Consistent categories for LEEP-wide conferences have also emerged, providing an element of persistence in the public forums available to <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> faculty and staff. This persistence of technology and practice supports the development of a LEEP skill-set and shapes student expectations with respect to <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and use of resources.   </p>

   <p>LEEP work <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and norms emerge around these on-line artefacts in a number of ways and
contribute to a sense of persistence of behaviour. Interviewees cite a &quot;LEEP way&quot; of doing things, which applies both to faculty and <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> To some extent, this includes emergent norms of
&quot;netiquette,&quot; such as the ability to effectively participate in chat room <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and post
appropriately to <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>conferences. And for instructors it means providing certain <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of access to on-line materials and certain <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of on-line experience. Overall, the persistence of technologies, resources, and interpersonal expectations makes LEEP feel like an on-going <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of just a menu of courses.  </p>

   <h3>Periodicity</h3>
   
   <p>Rhythms and patterns of activity shape expectations and <span>interactions</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Knowing the rhythms of activity can help people <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>school</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> work and home responsibilities. It can also make the unfamiliar more comfortable, since the rhythms of LEEP are driven by broader academic rhythms that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>recognize from earlier college experiences. On-line courses follow the same semester schedule as their on-campus counterparts. Instructors organize courses around weekly readings and audio sessions. Postings on class and general LEEP conferences <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the ebb and flow of campus life in general and some events happen simultaneously on-campus and on-line, such as an annual salary negotiation workshop. The virtual campus <span>parallels</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the physical campus with which most <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>through prior college experiences. </p>

   <p>Events marking entry into and exit from the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>particularly reinforce a sense of shared
rhythm and experience for the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>as a whole. The initial LEEP event is the two-week orientation
or &quot;boot camp&quot; that takes place on-campus prior to the Fall semester. It couples a required core class with technology workshops. Orientation both shapes expectations and creates a common body of experience, often centered on adversity, such as <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>night group work sessions or struggles with
the new technologies:</p>
   
<blockquote>&quot;That's where we go through the crucible of 390. You develop cohort 'in' jokes and you really see the best and worst in people's personalities.&quot; (Julie, LEEP student/staff)</blockquote>
   
   <p>At the other end, the on-line graduation ceremony also reinforces this sense of periodicity and
participation, linking LEEP <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with the live ceremony. LEEPers can come to campus to receive
their diploma or they may participate virtually via a WebCam broadcast of the ceremony. They hear their <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>read at the appropriate moment and can join other LEEPers in a chat room, joking with each
other as they view the ceremony.</p>

   <p>Most important, of course, are the individual class rhythms. Weekly audio <span>lectures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and posts to the
class conferences provide temporal structures for people's work and <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> The structure of the
conferences may shift to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>changes in the rhythm of the class: </p>

   
<blockquote>&quot;There was also a weekly [conference] that focused on the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>we were covering in the syllabus. The class got a little behind, so I switched to a topic-based discussion rather than a weekly
[conference].&quot; (Daniel, LEEP instructor)</blockquote>
   
   <p>On-campus sessions are also events to plan for and work toward, both academically and socially. By
constructing these <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>moments for participation on a weekly and a per-semester basis, and by marking the starting and endpoints of the programme, LEEP sustains the key rhythms of academic
life: entry into, maturation within, and completion of an academic <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>programme. </p>

   <h3>Boundaries</h3>
   
   <p>Boundaries define who participates in an activity, with whom we interact, etc. LEEP <span>limits</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and guides participation in the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> But boundaries key also consist of agreements that are worked out by individuals themselves, between <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> instructors, employer and <span>families</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> as people <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>what it means to participate in a virtual <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>programme.   </p>

 <h4>Entry points and guideposts</h4>

 
 <p> LEEP draws clear boundaries between who is &quot;in&quot; and who is &quot;out&quot; of the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Access to <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and other LEEP resources (maintained through the use of passwords) <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>faculty <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or formal admission into the graduate programme. Participation is thus <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to
people with a broadly shared sense of purpose and an emerging set of shared virtual classroom experiences. While formal membership does not guarantee active participation, the establishment of specific entry points into the LEEP <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>helps shapes the nature of the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that develops in the virtual forums. </p>

 <p>The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>LEEP Web site acts as the foyer of an on-campus building in which a directory lists faculty and staff, signs lead to classrooms and offices, and bulletin boards post information about events. This is all replaced on-line by <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to further Web sites. While the Web page itself looks nothing like a traditional building, the organization of materials and <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>reflects <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>activities and aspects of campus life. Similarly, on-line courses retain the <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>metaphors of bulletin board and classroom. These <span>parallels</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>between the virtual and on-line provide a sense of the <span>familiar</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> tying on-line experience back to past college experience for participants. </p>

 <h4>Time, place, and negotiation</h4>

 
<p>Distance and temporality no longer function as boundaries, with both positive and negative <span>consequences</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> The LEEP technologies are <span>designed</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> of course, to help <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>overcome their <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of
proximity. On-line <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and reserve materials, audio archives, etc., are equally available to all
student, no matter what their location, and postings to class forums such as the chat room or <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>conferences look <span>identical</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>whether the poster is in <span>Chicago</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or Alaska. Just as the &quot;where&quot;
of participation has diminished in importance, so has the &quot;when&quot; of participation. While people still talk about <i>last week's</i> class and the <i>current</i> semester, virtual resources and
activities can be recalled in the way in which traditional face-to-face <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>could not be. Archived class audio sessions, chat logs, and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>conferences are accessible at any time, and can be listened to, posted to, or read in any order.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;I liked the LEEP format better because [lectures] were archived. If you missed something you could go back and listen again..&quot; (Beverly, on-campus student)

<br><br>
&quot;There is more time for reflection. Or if you change your mind, if someone convinced you [through
their own post], you can come back later in the week and say, 'hey, that's a good point that I didn't think of.'&quot; (Madeline, LEEP student) </blockquote>

<p>The <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of temporal boundaries that come with &quot;any place, any time&quot; can create its own problems. Students repeatedly cite the need to negotiate both temporal and physical boundaries at work and at home. Participation in any <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>programme changes the amount of time one has available for personal and professional relationships, to which others must adjust. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>virtual <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>programme may mean sharing computing resources with other family members:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;My wife and I share an office. We share a <span>computer</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> too. There were a few <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>at the very <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>about the amount of time that was being taken, but we were able to talk that out.&quot; (Stan, LEEP student)</blockquote>

<p>Other <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>must negotiate work boundaries, even redefining what &quot;work&quot; includes:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;As far as I was concerned and my employer was concerned, there was a clear-cut distinction between my work time and my <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>time.&quot;(Madeline, LEEP student)
<br><br>
&quot;My boss and I had this agreement that you can spend some time working on your <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>stuff if it
has some relation to what you are doing at work.&quot; (Shawn, LEEP student)
</blockquote>

<p>For many <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> the close connection between work, profession, and <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>makes it harder to
keep these arenas <span>separate</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> especially as they begin to acquire job-related technical skills:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The LEEP <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>quite <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>become the techies in their job because people expect that they have the skills because they are learning about and using computers.&quot; (Jerry, LEEP staff)</blockquote>

<p>Students who participate from home find that classwork becomes embedded in family activities,
especially when the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is a shared space, such as the kitchen or living room. Boundaries
<span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by virtual activity (&quot;Mother is in class here at the computer&quot;) rather than physical
availability (&quot;Mother is not in the house&quot;) are difficult to convey:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;My kids don't quite understand what I'm doing. They'll come down [to the family room] and watch me during class &hellip;. I'm trying to pay <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and my kids are asking me all these questions.&quot; (Shawn, LEEP student)</blockquote>

<p>Participating in a virtual space from within a busy physical space, whether work or home encourages (or requires) <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to participate in 0e activities which detract from the classroom experience. Students make dinner while listening to audio <span>lectures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or miss parts of <span>lectures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>as others <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>their <span>attention</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>Engagement</h3>

<blockquote>&quot;[Virtual communication] is so engrained in me. For my mother-in-law for my grandmother it's a totally different thing. They would see a huge break. I think I have been so involved with it, it's just another form of communication.&quot; (Jerry, LEEP staff)</blockquote>

<p>In a face-to-face <span>setting</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> conversations with others vary in their content and level of spontaneity. As a student, I might go to a professor's office hours with a specific class-related question in mind and end up talking about career issues. On my way to the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>lab, I might run into a classmate and end up comparing notes first on an assignment and then a movie. This kind of &quot;social rhythm and <span>density</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of engagement&quot; helps build and <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>LEEP tries to enable this kind of engagement by providing <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> staff and faculty with multiple
ways of connecting, including both synchronous and asynchronous forums. For instance, instructors list
the many ways in which they work with students:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;[When they were having difficulty], I could follow up in an e-mail, I could call them on the phone, sometimes I could post an explanation to the conference.&quot; (Daniel, LEEP instructor)
<br><br>
&quot;I do e-mail office hours. I also have on-line office hours [in the chat room] where I actually
sit down and try to recap how far we've come.&quot; (Claire, LEEP instructor)
<br><br>
&quot;With a couple of the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>&hellip; I made time to go into the [chat room] and went over their
final project. &hellip; [With others] I had a lot of e-mail back and forth. This is a part of the <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>you don't see.&quot; (Maureen, LEEP instructor)</blockquote>

<p>Much of this engagement is <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>organized around class activities, but the on-line forums
also offer a chance to stray into other topics. Students gathering prior to an on-campus class may
chat about the weather, a movie, their family; <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in an on-line class may do the same. Being
&quot;part of&quot; a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or &quot;feeling welcome&quot; in a programme is linked to whether or not these <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of engagements take place regularly and with ease.</p>

  <h4>On-line engagements</h4>
  
 <blockquote>&quot;&hellip; where is everybody, where are myclassmates?&quot; (Julie, LEEP student/staff)</blockquote>

 
 <p>Problems with engagement <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>into two different categories. First, there is the problem of just linking up with people. But secondly, there is the problem of whether the link will be rich and worthwhile one when it is made. </p>

 <p>The first problem falls into the general category of <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>presence (<a href="#lom98">Lombard &amp; Ditton, 1998</a>). Moving into an on-line <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>makes it harder to bump into people or to see their availability at any point in time, and harder to signal <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>own
availability and interest in conversation. Chat room participants can see who is logged in and browsers of the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>conferences can see who has <span>newly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>posted. Generally, however, participants in LEEP have little overview of who is where at any moment: </p>
 
<blockquote>&quot;We're still looking for the magic bullet if there is one as far as helping LEEP <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>feel like they are part of the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot; (Julie, LEEP staff/student)</blockquote>
 
 <p>The class chat room may be a part of that &quot;magic bullet.&quot; People can &quot;see&quot; each other in the <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of login <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on the screen. Conversations are woven together in real-time to form multiple, overlapping and sometimes even intersecting threads. The experience can be powerful: </p>

 
<blockquote>&quot;We had live class sessions &hellip; and this was incredible. We learned something about each other's personalities. It was like having a real classroom. So the number one thing was
involvement.&quot; (Melissa, LEEP student)</blockquote>
 
 <p>Some of the interactional work done during class is personal. Students may &quot;whisper&quot; to
one another during, with some reporting that they carry on three or four private conversations at one time. They also post questions during the course of the lecture and answer each other's questions if they can. Different threads of comments and questions are often intermingled (<a href="#ruh01">Ruhleder, 2001</a>). While the chat room is not always lively by face-to-face standards during the course of a lecture (a silence of several minutes is common in the chat room but impossibly awkward face-to-face), the <span>density</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>increases during breaks and before class in particular. The chat room also enables in-class group work: </p>
 
<blockquote>&quot;[After the break] they'd come back and get <span>straight</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>into their groups. &hellip; They'd <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>things in their groups for about 20 minutes or so and then all come back together

&hellip; and report.&quot; (Mark, LEEP instructor)</blockquote>
 
 <p>The chat room thus <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the potential for real-time <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and relatively free-flowing
conversation. It is also quite different from a face-to-face conversation not only because of the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for multiple threads, but because no one <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>can <span>hold</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the floor (anyone can post at any time), sometimes making for more equal conversation. </p>

 <p>The pace of the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>conferences, in contrast to the chat room, may make it hard to feel that one is talking with other people. Discussions <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>slowly, with threads running for longer periods since <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>may post comments at any point in time. Class conference deadlines often correspond to other class activities, such as <span>lectures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(post on such-and-such a <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>before the next class), shaping the broader ebb and flow of participation. When posts are made only in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to an assignment, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>may perceive the conferences as an uninteresting place: </p>
 
<blockquote>&quot;I posted to the [conference] and &hellip; it was just dead. &hellip; people are posting just to post.&quot; (Katherine, on-campus student)</blockquote>

 
 <p>The organization of classroom work can support or hinder engagement beyond &quot;posting just to
post.&quot; Assignments that encourage dialogue between <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>can help overcome the barriers
of distance and can be combined with e-mail or the telephone to bring <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>together around
a set of class-related problems:  </p>
 
<blockquote>&quot;[I] felt like an out0er coming in since it was my first semester. [Our first homework] helped break the <span>ice</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> I had some questions and I e-mailed other <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and got good
responses back.&quot; (Monique, LEEP student)</blockquote>
 
 <p>Some instructors have <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>post assignments and critique each other's work to encourage
discussion. In an interface <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>class, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>posted initial project prototypes on the Web. Other <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>then responded to and commented on their prototypes.
 </p>
 
<blockquote>&quot;Each <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>had to comment on the Web-page designs of other groups. This obviously
generated a large number of postings-often these were fairly short but there were a lot of them.&quot; (Mark, LEEP instructor)</blockquote>

 
 <p>How should instructors participate in these forums? Instructors may see themselves as trying to not stifle participation while <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>feel their efforts unacknowledged. For instance, one instructor explained that she tries not to single out students: </p>
 
<blockquote>&quot;I find myself not praising <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>who are contributing the most because I'm afraid I'll go overboard someone else will feel, 'oh, my gosh, I'm worthless.' &hellip; [Instead], &quot;I
would summarize [the discussion] and try to synthesize&quot; (Claire, LEEP instructor)</blockquote>
 
 <p>Her synthesis would name <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>who had contributed to the broader dialogue. Yet whereas Claire thought she was following good pedagogical <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by not dominating the discussion or appearing to play favorites, a student in her class perceive the <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>differently: </p>
 
<blockquote>&quot;The discussion was unguided. &hellip; She would post to the [conference] maybe once or twice a week. These would be very short messages saying thank you for that comment, it's important to be thinking about that in conjunction with this.&quot; (Katherine, on-campus student)</blockquote>

 
 <p>She adds that it was nothing like sitting in a face-to-face class: &quot;no professor in robes!&quot;
The <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of this remark is addressed in the section on engagement and hierarchy, below. </p>

 <p>Finally, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>engage with each other <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of class, as they would in an on-campus course. They work on group projects, often developing Web projects that can then be shared with others. These projects have both intellectual and social value: </p>
 
<blockquote>&quot;Group projects work really well, mixing up [cohorts] and having to get to know [people] better. Now when we get together for on-campus weekends &hellip; I know someone from working on a group project pretty well. It's all those little personal <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that help.&quot; (Moira,
LEEP student)</blockquote>

 
 <p>The on-campus weekends she <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to form one of the opportunities that LEEP <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>have to
work with each other in <span>person</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> The next section examines these contacts. </p>

<h4>The role of face-to-face interaction</h4>

<blockquote>&quot;Those two weeks together last summer were critical. It helps to be able to put faces to all those <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>screen.&quot; (Cathy, LEEP student)</blockquote>
 
 <p>The face-to-face <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>provide an important counterpoint to the virtual aspects of LEEP. On-campus meetings serve as a social glue, helping people <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>relationships. By starting with a two-week on-campus session, participants' first taste of this &quot;virtual&quot; programme is face-to-face and their relationships with their cohort are based on face-to-face <span>interactions</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Students form bonds that continue over time: </p>

 <blockquote>&quot;The face-to-face meetings are definitely important so you can create real people. Then when you talk to them over the net, they're your friends, you know who they are.&quot; (Melissa,
LEEP student)
<br><br>
&quot;&hellip; In class [during the semester] I tended to joke around and talk to people like my roommate from the campus time and other people I spent a lot of time with on campus.&quot; (Shawn, LEEP student) </blockquote>

 <p>This creates problems in integrating not only different LEEP cohorts but also non-LEEPers as
they begin to take more LEEP courses: </p>
 
<blockquote>&quot;They haven't had what we call the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>building 'boot camp' part. &hellip; They
weren't as comfortable with each other and they didn't feel like putting themselves out.&quot; (Claire, LEEP instructor)</blockquote>

 
 <p>Relationships are expanded through the on-campus meetings that <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>each semester. Every class has a face-to-face meeting for a <span>day</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> These class sessions may consist of activities that could not have been done through LEEP. More importantly, they give people a chance to meet fellow class members who were not part of their cohort and deepen relationships with people they have already met on-line: </p>

 <blockquote>&quot;It was a little alarming &ndash; so many people, so many new faces &ndash; but I think most people who are going to do this <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>have a sense of adventure &hellip; they want to meet each other.&quot; (Moira, LEEP student)
<br><br>
&quot;It was really <span>crucial</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> particularly for people to get to know each other and me. The class as
a whole felt very different after the on-campus session.&quot; (Melissa, LEEP student)

</blockquote>

 <p>In contrast, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>who are not full-time LEEPers (classes are also open to <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in the on-campus programme) were likely to report that the on-campus time was poorly spent and <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>little benefit: </p>

 <blockquote>&quot;It didn't help &hellip; student-to-student <span>interactions</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> The only reason it was of any use at all was because [the instructor] talked a lot; his <span>lectures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>brought certain areas to life.&quot; (Ed, on-campus student)
<br><br>
&quot;I don't see a big purpose in the on-campus sessions. &hellip; What the advantage of seeing the class or seeing the teacher might be I can't understand. It's nice see the other <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and see what they look like; but you're not going to make buddies in it.&quot; (Beverly, on-campus student)

</blockquote>

 <p>Both of the above <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>also cited the inconvenience of the mid-semester sessions: that it was &quot;a real chore for a lot of people to get here&quot; and that it should have been at the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the semester in order to cover some basic topics. In short, non-LEEPers look at these sessions from an instrumental <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>&ndash; is it necessary to cover this material or use the time in this way? &ndash; while LEEPers <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on the affective benefits and weigh them positively against the hassles of
travel to campus. </p>

 <p>Finally, many on-campus <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>attend class not from home or work, but from the GSLIS
<span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>laboratory</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> This gives them a particular advantage over their LEEP counterparts, in that
closing the chat room window does not end class for them. </p>
 

<blockquote>&quot;After an on-line session, the people that I knew on-campus would just go out. People would meet in the lab and go out for dinner or something. &hellip; We couldn't stop talking about library science. We're all so involved and <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>so many <span>classes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot; (Katherine, on-campus student)</blockquote>
 
 <p>Currently, on-campus <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are still a minority in these distance <span>classes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> As we saw above, however, their presence is changing the role of face-to-face <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and the desire for certain forms of connection with other <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>within the LEEP programme. In one way or another, LEEP
on-line encounters are <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by face-to-face and vice versa, helping people develop a robust, multi-faceted picture of their fellow LEEP participants. </p>

 <h4>Engagement and hierarchy</h4>
 
<blockquote>&quot;So, where is our professor?&quot; (question posed to Mark, LEEP instructor)</blockquote>

<p>Academic and workplace hierarchies <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>expectations about expertise and experience that
often define appropriate <span>interactions</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> In the traditional classroom, the instructor is perceived as the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>source of knowledge. The set-up of the room-a chalkboard and lectern at one end with rows of chairs facing that direction-supports this <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of authority. It is harder for <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to talk with each other, catch each other's eye with a question, etc., than in a seminar room, for instance. When they do <span>speak</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> everyone in the class, including the instructor must wait while they finish their question or comments.</p>

<p>The technologies of the on-line classroom break down at least some of the factors that structure
<span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>between <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and instructor. The simultaneous access to chat and audio, for example,
changes the ease with which <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>may introduce new information and answer questions in a classroom. Con0er the following excerpt from a simultaneous audio broadcast and chat room <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> The far-left column shows how many seconds into the <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>each part of the <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>occurred. The next column over tells what the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>would have heard the instructor broadcasting over their <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>speakers at various points in the excerpt. The right hand column shows what was posted to the chat room at the same time that the lecture was <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>place. The excerpt is taken from <a href="#ruh01">Ruhleder</a> (2001):</p>

The instructor is lecturing when Student No. 1 posts a question related to the lecture 28 seconds into
this excerpt. The <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>follows the usual pattern in a class: the instructor answers the question at 0:36, then moves on with the lecture. Meanwhile, however, Student No. 2 is composing a more <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>answer that disagrees with the instructor, posted at 1:01. The instructor reads that post and comments on it at 1:04 before continuing with the lecture. </p>

<p>Shortly after this exchange, another student posted a comment saying he did not understand Student No. 2's post. The instructor explained further, adding, &quot;I'm not sure I'm communicating this clearly or not, so others feel <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to chime in through the chat and explain it some more&hellip;.&quot; At this
point, Student No. 2 <span>offered</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> &quot;How 'bout if I put something on the [computer conference] tonight so I can go into some detail?&quot; The chat room thus gives <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>a means by which to pursue topics that have been closed off by the instructor and the freedom to answer each other in ways that might not
have been appropriate in a face-to-face classroom <span>setting</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Coupled with the other media, such as the
<span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>conferences, they give <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>as well as instructors the means by which to author and share
class materials.</p>

<p>This participatory <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> however, may disturb other student's expectations about who is
in <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and whose expertise is <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to learning. Some see the professor as a guide through new and complex territories:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;When it's a very large area or a new area, you've got somebody [the professor] who's already walked through the woods pointing to the blazes on the tree saying, &hellip; that tree's boring but that <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>cool.&quot; (Ed, on-campus student)</blockquote>

<p>The structure of the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>conferences and course pages sets up a trail, but the student is
also talking about the interactional work the instructor via audio and conference posts. This student wants the professor to become the arbiter of &quot;which of two paths to go, which idea is right or <span>wrong</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot; Another student disliked the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>conferences for similar reasons:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;There's no professor to say, 'you're <span>wrong</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>' or, 'yes, I see your point, but this is also true.' The professor would post to the conference once or twice a week. It was nothing like sitting in a
class and getting lectured at by this wealth of knowledge. &quot; (Katherine, on-campus student)</blockquote>

<p>The professor is <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to be more than a guide here; the professor is the proverbial fount of
knowledge that will be poured into the empty vessel of the student. </p>

<p>Yet these are precisely the kind of knowledge hierarchies that distributed communication technologies are <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to break down. Their strength and (in many cases) their intention is to foster communication across traditional boundaries so that people can contributed based on their own <span>backgrounds</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and expertise. One instructor said, </p>

<blockquote>&quot;One of the things I learned from LEEP is that they [the students] had to do a lot, <span>chip</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in; I was more of a facilitator than a teacher. &hellip; Everybody was <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>each other's problems. I didn't have to do much.&quot; (Mark, LEEP instructor)</blockquote>

<p>Again, this instructor's <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>prompted the question quoted at the start of this section:
&quot;where is our professor.&quot; Though he took the question jokingly, it has more than a grain of
<span>truth</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to it: what is the new role of student an instructor in an <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that equalizes participation? Many <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>see their peers as teachers and sources of information about the profession:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;[We posted Web assignments.] I was looking forward to the comments, since they were made by people [classmates] who knew what they were talking about. &hellip; I liked this aspect a lot.&quot; (Todd, LEEP student)
<br><br>
&quot;One thing I really like about LEEP is that a lot of people who are professionals in the field are
<span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>classes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> And by working with them on group projects you get insight into their job and what their work experience is. And usually they'll bring to the project past experiences.&quot; (Madeline,
LEEP student) </blockquote>

<p>In this way, distance technologies allow for a kind of engagement among student and between students
and faculty that a traditional class arrangement may not support. Appreciation for this form of engagement hinges on how both faculty and <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>think of themselves with respect to learning and
<span>teaching</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>Authoring</h3>

 <blockquote>&quot;For example, for one class project, [group members] in <span>Chicago</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>did some PhotoShop manipulation on <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>which they forwarded to me which I modified and mapped to an <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>document which then went to Boston and was further manipulated and linked to some things and then was dropped off to a server in Illinois. Total time was 12 hours, the overall product went from a couple of images to a very complete Web-site format.&quot; (Stan, LEEP student)</blockquote>
  
  <p> The extent to which authoring is possible in LEEP <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on how one defines the ability &quot;to use and manipulate&quot; on-line space. LEEP <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and instructors have <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>power to shape this space. However, they are afforded <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>ability to construct on-line personae through postings and <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to other materials they develop. Students construct their these personae through personal and work-related Web pages, their LEEP on-line bios, their <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in the chat room and the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>conferences, and on-line course projects. Instructors create materials for their courses and organize the class experience. However, only the technical staff has the ability to manipulate the virtual space (adding items, changing <span>software</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> modifying the &quot;look and feel&quot;). </p>

<p>This makes LEEP a significantly different kind of space from a virtual meeting place like MOOSE Crossing (<a href="#bru98">Bruckman, 1998</a>), which is defined by individual and collaborative efforts of construction, and where no real <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>exists between participant and designer. The <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of authoring <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and responsibilities in LEEP reflects, <span>instead</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> a view of the programme as an <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that supports a guided experience: the development of intellectual and professional skills in library and information science.  </p>

  <h2>Conclusions: the model as a common vocabulary</h2>
  
  <p>Above, I used a model proposed by <a href="#myn98">Mynatt, <em>et al.</em></a> (1998), to explore particular aspects of LEEP, a distributed, virtual <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>programme in Library and Information Science that actively seeks to develop an on-line <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for its members. The model provides an effective <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for outlining and assessing various aspects of the <span>interactions</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> artefacts, and expectations that shape a on-line <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> It <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>a language for talking about the organization of human encounters in virtual space. The language of the model is particularly appropriate for LEEP, as the participants in this on-line <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>look to LEEP to help them achieve a set of instrumental objectives. LEEP thus becomes a tool for developing specific skills, fostering professional development and, <span>ultimately</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> improve employment prospects. What the LEEP programme <i>affords</i> its participants, then, becomes of <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>importance as well as theoretical interest.  </p>

  <p> What makes for a successful on-line <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and, in particular, what makes LEEP successful? LEEP works because is meets a needs of people whose desire to earn a Master's <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in library and information science outweighs any <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>posed by working in a distributed <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> It does so within a society characterized by increased familiarity with and use of distributed technologies. But other aspects of its success are deeply rooted in the model posed by Mynatt and her colleagues.</p>

<p> LEEP thrives because it provides an actionable on-line <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that can be characterized as a set of five key affordances. The LEEP <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is persistent, in that the <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and the nature of resources remain stable over multiple cohorts. It is characterized by a stable set of rhythms that <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>rhythms of U.S. educational institutions generally. It bounds <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and structures resources (even as participants must develop their own boundaries between the virtual educational world and their local personal worlds). Within these bounded <span>spaces</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> members of the LEEP <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>have available to them multiple forms of engagement, and they retain the ability to participate in some forms of authoring.  </p>

  <p> The resulting &quot;actionable environment&quot; is one that <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>participants the ability to carry out the activities needed to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>an <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>degree</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> LEEP has become successful as <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in terms of increasing enrollment and high student satisfaction. In part, it owes its success to its ability to carve up an open, limitless virtual space in an effective way. The model posed by Mynatt and her colleagues helps us to identify and articulate how this takes place. It suggests that other, similar communities &ndash; ones <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to support and enable the work of a specific membership &ndash; may benefit from con0ering <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in terms of affordances and actionability. And, in particular, it suggests that these concepts inform <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>decisions for LEEP and other constructed  communities, both technically and socially.</p>

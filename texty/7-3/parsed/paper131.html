<h2> Introduction</h2>

<p>The virtual world is a social world.  People <span>hold</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>asynchronous <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>on bulletin boards and in newsgroups.  They meet on-line synchronously in chat rooms and in multi-user domains (MUDs). They create web pages to present themselves or their interest areas to others and are careful to include e-mail addresses to facilitate personal contact.  They shop in virtual storefronts and browse the shelves of virtual libraries and museums. In the virtual world, people work together on projects and study together in distance <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>classes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> While <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>mediated communication (CMC) literature has devoted <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to social <span>interactions</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> the study of the <em>places</em> where these <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>occur has been the <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of human <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>(HCI).  The virtual place has been synonymous with the technologies listed above; people meet in the chat room, are guided through web portals, have <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>on the web board or ask questions on the listserv (<a href="#wel99">Wellman, <em>et al.</em>, 1999</a>; <a href="#oda98">O'Day, <em>et al.</em>, 1998</a>;<a href ="#jon95">  Jones, 1995</a>;  <a href="#mar99">Marty, 1999</a>; <a href="#hay00">Haythornthwaite, <em>et al.</em>, 2000</a>).  This study of social navigation focuses on the behaviour of people in relation to the virtual places where they meet.</p>

<blockquote>
<span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>navigation con0ers the creation of social settings and places in information space and behaviour in them, the sociality of information creation, people as members of groups and [the] nature of information itself, its location, evaluation and use. (<a href="#mun99">Munro, <em>et al.</em>,1999,p.2</a>)</blockquote>

<p>In physical space, navigation involves referent landmarks and shared artifacts, like <span>maps</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and compasses; but it also includes human <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>  For example, people ask others for directions &quot;Can you show me the way to the office?&quot; and receive replies <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>indexical landmarks;  &quot;It's the <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>door on the left&quot;.  Or, they rely on indirect social cues &quot;Everyone is walking toward this building.  This must be where the concert is.&quot;  In cyber space, navigation has typically been thought of in terms of <span>semantic</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>clues, like the labels on buttons and hypertext references, or spatial clues that employ graphic metaphors like doorways or hallways, etc..  <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>navigation is a more recent way of thinking about human behaviour in cyberspace. It con0ers how people navigate using social cues similar to those used for navigation in the physical world. Inhabitants of cyberspace are  &quot;guided and instructed by the activities of others within that space&quot; (<a href="#dou99">Dourish, 1999</a>). </p>

<p>Unlike navigation in physical space, navigation in cyberspace is not concerned with travel. To be absent in one place is to be present in another. Navigation in a physical world carries a connotation of going somewhere.  In the virtual world, as long as you stay on a <span>network</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> if you leave one place you instantly become present in another.  In this sense, navigation in cyberspace is about becoming present in various locations.  <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>navigation can <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>the way one chooses to become present in cyberspace.  Common examples of social navigation in cyberspace include web pages that offer lists of recommended URLs or pages that provide answers to <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>asked questions (FAQs).  More sophisticated means of social navigation include recommender <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>like the Amazon bookstore's schemes for inviting customers to review and recommend books.  <span>Computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>cooperative work (CSCW) <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that provide for an awareness of the activities of coworkers also employ social navigation. An example is to display indications of &quot;read-ware&quot; on web-pages via the display of visiter counts. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>method of supporting social navigation involves the use of guides, both human and artificial, who interact with individual users, conducting personalized virtual tours and tutorials (<a href="#mun99">Munro, <em>et al.</em>, 1999</a>; <a href="#dou99">Dourish, 1999</a>; <a href="#die99">Dieberger, 1999</a>).  </p>

<p>Studying different means of social navigation is a way to understand the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>human behaviour in a virtual <i>place</i>.   <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><i>place</i> in cyber space <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to a location where patterned behaviour can be <span>observed</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>  Those behaviours are the evidence that the space is occupied and that there is a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>there. The <span>proposition</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of this paper is that a study of social navigation behaviours can demonstrate that a <span>region</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of cyberspace has become a cyber place. This type of analysis might also make it possible to assess the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of social navigation occurring in a virtual place, enabling <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>between cyber communities.  As described in the next section, a single case, a graduate level distance <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>programme, is analyzed in depth. <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>navigation in this virtual place is examined against the backdrop of the persistent structures used in the programme.

<h2> The Ethnographic <span>Study</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span></h2>
<p>This is an ethnographic study of a single collaborative virtual <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>(CVE), a distance <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>programme called the Library Education <span>Experimental</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>Program (LEEP).  Through LEEP, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>can earn a Master's in Library Science from the Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois in Champaign Urbana.  Students begin LEEP in summer by <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>a two-week on-campus session that they refer to as &quot;boot camp.&quot; There they complete a condensed introductory course and attend workshops where they learn to use various programme technologies. After boot camp, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>take their LEEP <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>via the Internet. Classes are conducted using a <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of synchronous and asynchronous communications: including web pages, web boards, live <span>lectures</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> internet relay chat (IRC) and streaming audio.  Students come to campus for one <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>for each class in the middle of each semester for class related activities and workshops.</p>

<p>Between August of 1998 and May of 1999, a <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>study was conducted which <span>consisted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of four telephone interviews with seventeen LEEP <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>participated voluntarily in this research study. Using a <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>comparative method, each of the sets of interview questions were created based on the responses to earlier interviews (<a href="#tay97">Taylor &amp; Bogdan, 1997</a>).  The interviews resulted in approximately 750 transcribed pages. The interview transcripts were analyzed using open-coding, a method taken from grounded theory where the <span>codes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>arise from the data itself, rather than a predefined coding scheme (<a href="#str98">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</a>).  In the analysis, responses related to the persistent structures of the programme were later extracted to determine how these structures orchestrate activity in this on-line <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>  Persistent structures refer to the technologies, administrative <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and activities that persist over time in LEEP.  Using persistent structures as a backdrop to study human activity is a methodology borrowed from distributed cognition and activity theory (<a href="#nar96">Nardi, 1996</a>; <a href="#hut95">Hutchins, 1995</a>). Throughout this report, interview participants are <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to by pseudonym. All data quoted herein comes from interview transcripts. </p>  


<p>Persistent structures afford the types of social navigation that transform the distance <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>programme into a virtual place.  During coding, eighteen persistent structures were identified, but only half relate to social navigation.  This is because some, like the extramural library, serve a single, specific purpose.  Others, like the role of advisor <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>the necessary consistency that makes analysis of patterned behaviours possible. Structures like class web pages and syllabi are not analyzed at <span>length</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>because they are specific to a distance <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>environment and not to CVEs in general.  In the subset of data that remained after these controls, a theme emerged.  This data described ways people gained a sense of being present in the <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> or became aware of the presence of others, and the presence of LEEP itself as an institution or place.  <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>navigation <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to behaviours related to achieving presence.  Of the nine persistent structures that afford social navigation in this CVE, four are technological: programme related e-mail, the Internet Relay Chat (IRC), the IRC whispering <span>feature</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> and the web boards. Three of the structures are administrative roles:  technical support personnel, instructors and the dean of the LEEP <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> Two of the persistent structures involve activities: boot camp and the semesterly on-campus weekend.  It may seem unusual to include face-to-face activities in a study of behaviour in cyberspace, but the data show that these activities play a significant role in social navigation in the cyber <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> The following section of this paper presents the patterned behaviours afforded by the persistent structures.  These behaviours are mapped to three types of social navigation, guided behaviours, awareness behaviours and approbation behaviours.   Through this method, the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in the virtual place known as LEEP can be identified, described and evaluated.</p>

<h2>The Patterned behaviours</h2>
<p>Social navigation looks at the activities that <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>human behaviour in both physical and virtual environments.  Analysis of interview transcripts revealed patterned behaviours fitting into three broad categories.  Guided behaviours include recommendations and tutoring.  Awareness behaviours include activities that <span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>as members get oriented towards the virtual <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> aspects of on-line etiquette (netiquette) and the anarchistic activities of members where they appropriate the CVE technology for their own <span>purposes</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>category of behaviours are those related to approbation.  Approbation includes behaviours that affirm others, reassuring them that their behaviour in the CVE is appropriate.  These behaviours also include social activities that promote a sense of belonging. In the discussion that follows, these behaviours are viewed as joint actions, meaning they <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>both perpetrators and recipients to <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#cla96">Clark, 1996</a>).  For example, data about giving advice is not treated separately from data about getting advice.  These are both viewed as guided behaviours. <p>

<p>Social navigation is either <i>designed</i> to be part of a CVE or it emerges spontaneously through user activities.  These emergent behaviours are <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to in the matrix below (Figure 1)  as <i>bonus</i> behaviours, because of their value to a cyber <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> Bonus behaviours <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that members have taken on the role of molding <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>identity.  The matrix illustrates the relationship between the persistent structures of the LEEP programme and social navigation behaviours.  The nine structures used in the LEEP programme form the column headings.  The three types of social navigation behaviour, guided, awareness and approbation, are <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>into their subtypes as <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in the preceeding paragraph.  The subtypes are the rows of the matrix.  



<div align="center"><img src ="p131fig1.gif"></div><br>
<div align="center">Table 1: Matrix illustrating social navigation afforded by the persistent structures in LEEP.</div>

Finding the appropriate level of granularity for the row headings in the matrix is somewhat <span>arbitrary</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>  For example, I wrestled with the decision of whether or not to divide recommender behaviours into two groups, behaviours that are authoritative and those that <span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>from member's social networks.  In this matrix, I've combined them.  There is also leeway in the way the cells of the matrix are used.  For example, if I were working with <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>data, I could have used frequency counts in the cells.  Because this study involves a single case study, the cells were used to <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>whether the social navigation behaviours arose by <span>design</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>  emerged as a bonus behaviours or both. </p>


<p>A matrix similar to Table 1 below can provide potential members of a CVE with information about the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>before they invest the time or the money to become participants.  For example, in a discussion about distance <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>programmes,  Brown & Duguid (<a href="#bro00">2000</a>), in their book &quot;The <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>Life of Information,&quot; say a question potential distance <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>should ask is &quot;Is there a class with this text?&quot;  The authors are referring to CVEs where there is very little of the type of <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in a traditional classroom.  There is an analogous question that applies to all CVEs, &quot;Is this a cyber-place or simply a site in cyberspace?&quot;  This is a question social navigation researchers address.   To find answers, it is necessary to identify and evaluate the social behaviours occurring in the <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>  The matrix presents the relationship between the persistent structures of a CVE and the social navigation <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>place, and <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>a way to present evidence that a cyber <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>has been <span>formed</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>  Along with a supporting ethnographic report, the Table 1 matrix supports the claim that LEEP is not merely a cyber-space, but is also a cyber place. </p>

<h3>Recommender behaviours</h3>

<p>Automated recommendation engines are now used for social navigation on a number of sites on the web.  These <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>solicit and store information from and about CVE occupants and use this information to match and pass along recommendations to other occupants. For example, Amazon.com tells customers &quot;here are our recommendations for you.&quot; However, in LEEP, recommender behaviours are not automated. Some come from the administrators, as might be <span>expected</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> Occupants also act on the recommendations of their peers who provide a rich <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of  opinions covering a broad <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of topics (<a href="#con96">Constant, <em>et al.</em>, 1996</a>). <p> 

<blockquote>
I have all these people who just love to sit on web boards and give their opinion about stuff. Why don't I post [a question] and see what comes back. [Ellen]</blockquote>

<p>A number of persistent structures afford recommender behaviours. For example, in LEEP planned recommendations from instructors and the LEEP dean include papers to read, conferences to attend, and <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to take.  The recommendations are either e-mailed to the occupants or posted on the web board.  Bonus behaviours <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>when occupants react in kind, posting their own recommendations on the web board or responding to requests for recommendations via e-mail.  Student recommendations <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>administrative authority, but some individuals are recognized as experts in a given area; &quot;...with all his postings and stuff you can just tell he knows what he's talking about....&quot; [Alice].  Thus the recommendations of these CVE occupants are also viewed as authoritative.  During structured activities, like the on-campus session, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>have the opportunity to re-evaluate the credibility of others in the CVE. Thus, activities that <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>face-to-face affect the <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>recommender behaviour of occupants in a virtual place. </p> 

<blockquote>
&quot;..when I see things written down they seem to have more <span>weight</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> so when you pretty much communicate with other people through <span>writing</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> I think 'Holy cow these people are so smart.' ... Then I go on campus and I go 'Well'&quot; [Alice]. 
</blockquote>

<p>The IRC is not a <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>structure for recommender behaviour.  IRC text is relatively ephemeral.  It scrolls off the top of the screen and is forgotten. Even though archives of sessions are kept, occupants and administrators choose more permanent media like e-mail and the web board when making recommendations. </p>

<p>The <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>flow of recommender behaviours creates a support <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>for CVE occupants.  This form of social navigation in LEEP makes it possible to bring &quot;...a whole bunch of different eyeballs to a problem&quot;  [Jerry]. Most of the respondents in this study turn to their LEEP peers before administrators or <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>sources when they need advice related to their work in LEEP.  They report using the web board to solicit other types of professional advice as well. </p>

<h3>Tutoring behaviours</h3>

<p> Tutoring behaviours are the virtual equivalent of <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>a guided tour.  In some CVEs, like virtual museums, guided social navigation might refer to ordering displays in ways that meet the visitors' interests, or providing a virtual tour guide to answer questions about exhibits. In a virtual place, these behaviours also include on-line tutorial sessions and workshops.  Examples of <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>tutoring in LEEP <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>when an instructors use e-mail to guide  <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>through difficult assignments.  e-mail is useful for guided behaviour because <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>points can be maintained by keeping the same subject <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and by including <span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of past e-mails in replies.  Another example of tutoring behaviour in LEEP <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in the IRC.  The IRC contains a virtual room that is staffed by technical support personnel.  The room is open around the clock.  Occupants who use their telephone <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>for their Internet connection can receive help without breaking their on-line hookup.  &quot;I could listen to the professor, but I couldn't see anything on [my] IRC, so I just popped into that new room that they have for technical help.[Alice]&quot;   Through the web board, occupants also recieve tutoring related to administrative matters in LEEP. </p>

<blockquote>
...[the administrator] will post the message saying okay, here's virtual registration, this is how it works and you're going to have to really register too, and it's really all laid out like one, two, three.  [Doris]</blockquote>

<p>The tutoring behaviours described above <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>by <span>design</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> but other bonus tutoring behaviours are <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>LEEP.  These behaviours are often indirect, <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>forms of modeling that are afforded by the web board.  These behaviours <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>as <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>answer each other's questions and post assignments. </p>

I wait to see what they're talking about and many times that will help a lot to <span>cause</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>me to think about what the lesson is about and how it applies.	[Ted]</blockquote>
  
<p>Students who routinely wait &quot;to read everybody else's stuff&quot; [Barbara] before posting their own refer to themselves as 'Sunday Posters'.  User generation of metaphorical descriptions like this, that label patterned behaviour, are strong indicators of the health of a cyber <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>  Guided social navigation, such as recommender and tutoring behaviours are inherently social.  Afforded by the persistent structures in LEEP, they make virtual places more accessible.  The awareness behaviours, such as orienting, netiquette and anarchistic activities, support the on-line <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in other ways, as the following section illustrates.<p>

<h3>Orienting behaviours</h3>
<p>Speech acts are not always premeditated.  Most often they are <span>spontaneous</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>responses to social stimuli. Winograd and Flores label these as 'thrown' behaviours that 'flow with the <span>situation</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> during social <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#win86">1986</a>).  In the virtual <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>these 'thrown' utterances linger in textual form where they can be embarrassing for the programme initiate who thinks, &quot;I'll look dumb if I ask them this question&quot; [Alice], or:</p>

<blockquote>
Oh, what are other people thinking about my posting? Oh, gosh, why do my postings sound so shallow, and everyone else's sound so great? [Nancy]
</blockquote>

<p>However, in a brief time, occupants develop a better understanding of the role of text in a virtual place.  The persistent structures in LEEP support this transition. For example, many of the occupants encounter friends and acquaintances from boot camp. &quot;In a way we've had this on going conversation. It began [at bootcamp]. It just <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in the classes&quot; [Jan].  Reading becomes hearing and typing becomes <span>speaking</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> Occupants also discover that the dedication to peer support they developed at boot camp continues on-line, &quot;...there are a lot of people out there I think I could e-mail and ask for help, and I don't think I really saw that before&quot; [Clarissa]. Occupants also find that web board postings can be edited, and,  &quot;If you say something silly in the IRC, it is up there for a while, then it will <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>up there over the top of the screen&quot; [Alice]. Occupants become aware through the persistent structures of LEEP, that others are present with them in the CVE,  &quot;... there's a continual stream of consciousness&quot; [Beth].  The discussion continues around the clock, every <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of the week.</p>

<p>In addition to peer support, occupants become aware of programme support structures; &quot;I think there is a big effort to meet our needs&quot; [Shannon].  Rene describes how she became aware of the how far the technical support staff will go to meet occupants' needs in a personal way:</p>

<blockquote>
...at 11 pm on Saturday night, and he was <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>there, answering his 'phone. ...He was like &quot;go to bed. Stop crying; go to bed; it's taken care of...&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>Moreover, the LEEP Dean has a reputation for fixing any problem in a matter of hours; &quot;I wonder if she has an e-mail terminal in her ear&quot; [Clarissa].  </p>

<p>Thus, in orienting to life in a virtual place, an occupant grows in awareness from a sense of being 'thrown' into a strange new <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> to an awareness that they are in the midst of a sea of consciousness where they encounter strangers, friends and LEEP administrators; and that these others form a <span>solid</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>support <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>they can call on in times of need (<a href="#hay00">Haythornthwaite, <em>et al.</em>, 2000</a>).  &quot;The programme works hard to make you not feel isolated&quot; [Jan].</p>

<h3> Netiquette behaviours</h3>
<p>No discussion of social behaviour on the Internet is complete without a mention of  on-line etiquette, or netiquette.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>visitor to a virtual place soon becomes aware that there are both positive and negative norms of behaviour even in textual environments. For example; in r.a.t.s., a news group for soap opera fans, netiquette prevents users from sharing 'spoilers' that give away the plots of upcoming <span>episodes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#bay95">Baym, 1995</a>).  Some <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>are quick to point out violations of netiquette in LEEP.  For example, postings on the general webboard are <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to have a broad audience &quot;...I complained last time about all the personal stuff on the web board&quot; [Bill].  To others good netiquette means using e-mail <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of the webboards so <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>don't have to wade through &quot;...twenty-five [posted] messages that say 'Yeah, I'll be there.'&quot; [Jeff].  &quot;Hot spot&quot; complaining on the web board is another netiquette violation: &quot;...people use it like a therapy session.&quot; [Ellen]. It is con0ered proper netiquette to use e-mail, the whisper <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in the IRC, or to wait until the on campus weekend to vent frustrations. This way negative thoughts are kept within a student's private inner <span>circle</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of peers.  An example of a breach of netiquette in the IRC occured when a student opted to use a different color text to identify herself. &quot;It always bugged me. ...You know how it is when you are litle and you want to stand out...&quot; [Alice]</p>

<p>While netiquette is usually a bonus behaviour, initiated by occupants, this is not always the case.  Instructors can set rules of netiquette for their IRC <span>classes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>  For example, in the on-line storytelling class, the instructor reminds <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>not to talk while a classmate is telling a story (stories are told via a telephone link transmitted through streaming audio technology).  In this <span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> it is <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that &quot;talk&quot; <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to typed messages that appear onscreen during the class session.</p>

<p>Occupants in a virtual place typically use emoticons as a form of netiquette. Emoticons are the graphics created on a key board like the <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>smiley faces. Emoticons help make joking possible in textual environments where, without the nuances of face-to-face communication, like eye contact, facial <span>expressions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and gestures, cynical remarks can look mean and self-deprecating humor can be mistaken for self-consciousness. &quot;It's interesting how you negotiate that sensitivity without facial expressions&quot; [Jerry]. Experienced occupants of a virtual place, like LEEP, are aware of the netiquette needed to convey emotional content as well as the other rules and mores needed to socially navigate in a CVE.  </p> 


<h3>Anarchistic behaviours</h3>
<p>An unexpected behaviour in LEEP involves occupants' realization that they have the power to take control of some of the persistent structures.  Their appropriation of the technology is labeled anarchistic because it involves conscious rebelliousness. Occupants are aware that they have a <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of control over what <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in the CVE.  <span>Nevertheless</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> these behaviours are a bonus because they unite the occupants, giving them the sense of being &quot;us&quot; to the administration's &quot;them&quot;.  The first signs of rebellion show up in boot camp. Boot camp develops &quot;sort of a shared history&quot; [Jeff].  The <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>occupants experience help them bond, &quot;...boot camp forms you into a group&quot; [Beth].    Boot camp is often the first place occupants experience their collective power.</p>

<blockquote>
...we all rebelled against the coordinators [of one workshop] which they weren't expecting. We were an unruly group. ...We were not impressed with what was going on. We figured it to be a waste of our time.   [Rene]</blockquote>

<p>The <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>can turn up again in the on-line <span>classes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> &quot;It's just a little anarchy.  The instructors are still in control, ...but everyone is getting goofy&quot; [Alice].  Occupants become intent on playing off each other's comments. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>tangent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>develops and continues until the theme is played out or the instructor regains control. Also, in the IRC, occupants form whisper groups.  &quot;Whispering&quot; was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>as a function used for private messaging between <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and the instructor.  The function is appropriated by the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in order to <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>social relationships during class time, &quot;it's like the electronic equivalent of passing notes, but it's the only time you ever see these people&quot; [Doris].  According to our interview respondents, whispering is an almost <span>universal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>behaviour in LEEP.  Only one respondent does not whisper to classmates regularly. Several respondents are adept at multi-tasking during class sessions.  They are able to listen to a lecture, read IRC comments and <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>conversations with their whisper group.  &quot;...if I try to look at a blank screen and listen to some instructor drone on and on, I can't even see him. No matter how interesting it is, it just <span>isn't</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>enough&quot; [Clarissa].  Whispering provides an additional channel of activity when occupants are on-line together.  </p>

<p>Because occupants in whisper groups tend to know each other well, rules of netiquette are suspended.  Topics cover the inane &quot;I'm going to make a sandwich&quot; [Doris] and the sociable, &quot;How was your ski trip?&quot; [Shannon].  Whispered conversation is also a good way to &quot;blow off steam.&quot; [Rene].  Humor is prevalent and while cynical humor is avoided on the web board and the IRC , it is common in whispers. &quot;You've got the people who are going, 'What does she think she's talking about?'&quot; [Doris].  Occasionally a class is scheduled at the same time as a popular TV show. Some respondents will attempt to <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>listening to the lecture, keeping up with the TV <span>plot</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> and contributing to their whisper groups.  But this balancing act has resulted in &quot;failed whispers&quot; that have entered into LEEP lore.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>whisper is a comment that is meant to be private but is accidentally posted to the entire synchronous population.  </p>

<p>Whispered conversations are not always peripheral to programme tasks.  &quot;...a lot of it does pertain to either clarifying terms the instructor uses, or, if you have to step away for a second and come back, 'What did I miss?' That <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of thing.&quot; [Bill].   The &quot;fervid whispering&quot; leads some occupants to wonder what administrators think about their behaviour.  </p>

<blockquote>I can't decide whether it <span>drives</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>the professor nuts or they're paying no <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to me or if it gives like a good feeling of 'Wow, my class is so tight!'. I always wonder [Doris].</blockquote> 

<p>Whispers are not archived and there is no way for LEEP administrators to read them. The <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of official reaction to whispers lends surreptitiousness to the activity, reinforcing the anarchistic feel of whispered conversation. programme designers can not generate anarchistic behaviours.  They are adopted as a result of an awareness of the presence and activities of others in this virtual place and are afforded by the persistent structures.  They serve the CVE by adding to the camaraderie the occupants experience in LEEP, as well as providing a channel for asking programme related questions.</p>

<h3>Affirming behaviours </h3>

<p>Approbation behaviours are a <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>type of social navigation and are related to the impact of affective states on behaviour. These behaviours are directed by the human need for approval and belonging.  An example of approbation behaviour <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>on the Internet when on-line businesses greet visiters by name when they visit a web site.  Though automated, the greeting indicates that the system has personalized its accommodations to some extent to suit the individual.  Approbation behaviours convey personal recognition and individual <span>accommodation</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> In a virtual place, as in a physical place, they convey the sense of caring and being cared for, which are hallmarks of a &quot;good community&quot; (<a href="#lyo87">Lyons, 1987, p. 247</a>).  Like all social navigation, these behaviours spring from fundamental human desires to live together, work together, experience together, or simple be together.  </p> 

<p>Occupants navigating in a CVE commonly experience uncertainty, &quot;When I read everybody else's postings they sound so much more intelligent than mine.&quot;  [Nancy]?  &quot;Do I sound like I've had a couple of beers&quot; [Ellen]?  Affirmation approbations behaviours communicate to occupants that their behaviour fits within the <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>expectations and the social norms of the CVE.  Occupants are eager for approval from both peers and CVE administrators. This influences their other on-line activities.   Bonus behaviours in LEEP <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>when occupants send each other affirming e-mail, &quot;I'm just brazen enough to send them a note and say, 'That's really interesting'&quot; [Jerry], or reply to each others posts, &quot;It made me check the web boards much quicker in the morning to see what other people had to say about [my posting]&quot; [Jeff]. Occupants and administrators offer feedback to each other in the IRC, both publicly and in whisper, &quot;You get all these comments on your behalf...&quot; [Ellen].  </p>

<p>Replies and feedback from administrators are planned affirming behaviours.  For example, when technical support staff, instructors, and the LEEP dean <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>promptly to e-mail and web postings this is interpreted as affirmation.  Just as in the physical world, in the virtual world, a quick <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>tells the recipients that they <span>belong</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and are valuable members of the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> &quot;To feel connected you need that quick <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>time&quot; [Shannon]. &quot;...I never had an instructor that didn't answer me that <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>or very immediately&quot; [Alice].  The LEEP dean sets and maintains the affirming tone of the programme: </p>
<blockquote>
I think [her] personality on the web board is certainly 'responsible' and the double sense of that is that she does <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>immediately, and that she takes responsibility.  It's very nurturing.  It builds a certain amount of security.  [Jerry]</blockquote>

<p>Moreover, instructors are authority <span>figures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>whose appraisals are highly credible. Instructors provide affirmation through individual encouragement, which, in turn, affects activity, &quot;Just to have somebody behind you all the way saying, 'Yeah, yeah, you can do it. Go for it. Just step out there and try.' ... is very helpful&quot; [Jerry].  Affirming behaviours are ways occupants in a CVE gain the sense that it is appropriate for them to be there.   All the persistent structures in LEEP are used for approbation activities.  The data displayed in Table 1 demonstrates that the inclusive behaviours described next play a <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>role in building the sense of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>on-line. </p>

 
<h3> Inclusive behaviours</h3>
<p>Inclusive approbation behaviours relate to the desire to &quot;belong&quot; in a virtual place and incorporate the way occupants navigate socially to achieve and <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>a feeling of belonging.  In LEEP, this begins during the introductory two weeks where <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>meet face-to-face; &quot;...after boot camp you really feel like you're an integral part...&quot;[Alice]. The feeling continues in the virtual <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>where the web boards play a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>role in building inclusion, &quot;They know. There is that level of accountability&quot; [Ellen]. Mutual accountability leads to <span>mutual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that is often <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>up by e-mail, &quot;...if I haven't seen somebody's posting by a certain point, I would e-mail this thing 'where are you?'&quot; [Barbara].  &quot;... when I used [the web boards] a lot I felt like I knew what was going on and had a connection to what was going on&quot; [Alice]. </p>

<p>Whispering is another way <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>let others know they are included, &quot;...I think that's invaluable in pulling the group together, or, feeling connected with people&quot; [Doris].  Whispering to another student is technically easy to do.  The <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of the current IRC occupants appear on the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>screen.  Clicking on a  name selects that <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>as the recipient of the whisper. Selected <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>are highlighted and several <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>can be selected at once. Socially, whispering can be more demanding, particularly if there are few boot camp peers on-line.  Occupants report &quot;casting about&quot; for others to whisper to.  Students select a <span>person</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> send a whispered message, then wait to see if it is recipricated. <span>Sometimes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>they must do this several times to find a whisper partner.</p>

<p>Another form of inclusive approbation behaviour is demonstrated by administrators' willingness to make individual accommodations for occupants.  &quot;...there's a lot of understanding and accommodations made&quot; [Alice]. The majority of the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>work full time and must <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>obligations for work, family and LEEP. &quot;One thing that is very beneficial is they're doing their best to accommodate individual needs&quot; [Ted]. </p> 


<p>Being willing to adapt requirements and change schedules is a way to let <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>know that they are valued participants. &quot;That didn't make me feel like a special case. It made me feel like 'Your just part of the family, we'll work this out.'&quot; [Jerry].  Feelings and motivation affect activity in a virtual place just as they do in the physical world.  The approbation behaviours afforded by the persistent structures work on the affective rather than the <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>level, encouraging social navigation in LEEP.  Con0ered along with the other types of social navigation behaviour, the guided, awareness and approbation behaviours <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that LEEP is inhabited, that it has become a virtual place.  </p>

<h2>Structural Support for <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>Navigation </h2>
<p>The persistent structures of a virtual place afford and in many cases, orchestrate the social navigation that <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in a CVE. The technologies are the media of communication, while CVE administrators in various <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>model behaviours.  The face-to-face activities afford richer communication and work to create a shared history among CVE occupants.  At LEEP, these structures set student expectations and support the types of social navigation they experience. The <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of this study <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>for the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of other collaborative virtual environments.  Understanding the social behaviour afforded by persistent structures, designers of virtual 'places' might be better able to generate and support social navigation in on-line communities.  Viewed column-by-column, Table 2 demonstrates how the persistent structures in LEEP support these behaviours.

<div align="center">Table 2:  <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>Navigation afforded by the persistent structures in LEEP.</div>

<h3>e-mail</h3>
<p>By programme <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>at LEEP, e-mail supports recommender behaviours.  e-mail from CVE administrators is authoritative, but those recieved from peers are also viewed as credible.  e-mail is a private means of communication in a CVE.  For example, in LEEP, e-mail is used for personalized instruction and to provide feedback from instructors and peers.  It is also used to vent complaints. e-mail can be used for approbation behaviours.  It provides a structure for personal, private affirming messages and words of encouragement.</p>

<h3>The Web Board</h3>
<p>The web board supports most types of social navigation.  It is the most public persistent structure in LEEP. Thus, it provides a means for guided behaviours that <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>by <span>design</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>  However, in LEEP, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>also make recommendations via the web board.  Moreover, each web board post provides a model for those that come after, making the web board an ideal <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>for awareness behaviours. Awareness behaviours do not <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>by <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>on the web board.  They are bonus activities that result as CVE occupants <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves through their postings.  This makes the web board the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>means for <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>the tone of a CVE. This is also done via the approbation behaviours that result from student postings where acts of kindness are publically identified and reciprocated (<a href="#con96">Constant, <em>et al.</em>, 1996</a>).  </p> 

<h3>The IRC</h3>
<p>Because users must be on-line at the same time, the IRC <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>an immediacy that makes occupants in a CVE feel connected to each other.  In LEEP, the IRC is used by technical staff and instructors to present information and instructions.  But, the IRC also supports the awareness behaviours.  For example, during a chat session text and <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>quickly off the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>screen.  Students can follow conversation threads initiated by other <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>rather than those initiated by instructors. While this detracts from efficient communication, it contributes to the understanding that IRC occupants have developed the kind of comraderie that is found in face-to-face <span>classes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<h3>The Whispering <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in the IRC</h3>
<p>Whispering is a persistent structure that is <span>controlled</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>entirely by <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>at LEEP.  This makes it the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>structure affording anarchistic behaviours.  Whispering is also a way for occupants to <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>connections to their closest peers. Whispering compensates for the leanness of the IRC as a <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>by allowing <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to carry on different conversations simultaneously. Because of the privacy of the structure, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>use the whisper <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to provide the type of feedback that makes their peers feel included and affirmed. </p> 


<h3>Technical Support Staff</h3>
<p>Technical support is <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>for social navigation in LEEP. Participants who are new to the CVE <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>must learn to use the various technologies.  This technical support staff  helps <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>get up to speed with other, more technically savvy <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>    Technical support staff make recommendations about <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>configurations and offer on-line workshops and tutorials covering LEEP system <span>features</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>responsive technical staff lets occupants know that they are not the only ones encountering <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and that they are valued members of the CVE.</p>

<h3>The Instructors</h3>
<p>The instructor's educational role is not discussed in depth in this study of social navigation.  Rather, instructors act as guides to individuals and groups of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>as they navigate in a virtual place.  For example, experienced instructors are aware of problems occupants have incorporating on-line and offline activities.  By planning ahead and providing a complete syllabus and full instructions for assignments, they help relieve occupants' uncertainty.  Moreover, because they are authority <span>figures</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> instructors play a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>approbating role.   They reassure occupants their behaviour is acceptable and their <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>are valuable, which contributes to the &quot;high tech, high touch&quot; [Jerry] feel of the programme.</p>

<h3>The LEEP Dean</h3>
<p>It is easy to underestimate the potential value of having a supreme authority in an on-line <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>  In LEEP, the dean has an extremely active role, &quot;...she crosses &quot;t's&quot; and dots &quot;i's&quot; to make sure [the programme] just functions from a bureaucratic point of view, keeping us informed if there is any problems or tough questions or whatever&quot; [Jerry].   The idea that all problems can be dealt with promptly and wisely makes the LEEP <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>function like a 'benevolent monarchy'.  It conveys the idea of safety and that someone is looking out for the needs of the occupants.  When this <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>is <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>accessible, it makes occupants feel valued.</p>

<h3>Boot Camp</h3>
<p>In studying CVEs the tendency is to only <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>activities that <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>on-line, but augmenting these activities with face-to-face encounters can impact social navigation in many ways.  The boot camp experience, where student cohorts are created, is an orienting <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>where a lot of information can be transmitted in a small time <span>period</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>  Designed well, occupants discover peers they can rely on in times of need.  They also gain a sense of their own control over programme elements. Guiding <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>through sets of orienting activities provides a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>communications. Even more important occupants <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves as cohorts providing an intimate support <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>collaboration in the virtual realm.  Having this social <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>within a CVE adds to a sense of belonging in a virtual place.</p>

<h3>The On-campus Session</h3>
<p>The once-a-semester on-campus visit, when occupants meet face-to-face, reinforces social networks created at boot camp and provides an opportunity to &quot;put <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>with faces&quot; of new comrades in the virtual <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>  This activitiy also <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>an opportunity for <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to coordinate projects that <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>articulation work.  Articulation work <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to the communication needed to coordinate <span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> perspectives, goals, etc. that must be done in order to accomplish group work (<a href="#sch96">Schmidt & Simone, 1996</a>).   The on-campus session also provides a opportunity to exchange recommendations and to vent frustrations in an impermanent way.   </p>

<h2>Research Benefits</h2>
<p>This paper attempts to illustrate that it is social navigation that transforms a space on a <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>into virtual place.  Con0ering the affordances of the persistent structures in a distance <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>environment made it possible to identify and describe the ways social navigation <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in LEEP. The matrix used in this study provides a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that <span>maps</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>social navigation behaviours to the persistent structures.  The matrix also provides a graphic <span>representation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of these behaviours that might make comparisons between CVEs easier.  One benefit of <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>is that potential CVE members can be better informed. For example, people thinking of getting involved with a multi-user <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>(MUD) might like to know what kind of social navigation <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>there.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>potential member could discover that not only the administrators, but members of the MUD  make an effort to make newcomers feel included. If the CVE is a collaborative workplace, a potential employee might be glad to see the anarchistic behaviours that <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that employees feel <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to appropriate the persistent structures of the CVE for their own personal use.  The employer may or may not be pleased. 


<p>The matrix <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>might also help CVE designers and administrators to better support on-line communities.  For example, designers of MUDs might wish to improve orientation and provide more guidance so that novices can get up to speed more quickly. The matrix shows how useful e-mail can be for these <span>purposes</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>  Designers of CSCW environments might <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>the affordances of face-to-face activities in group work, particularly when complex articulation work is required. Designers of collaboratories can weigh the benefits of adding human administrators to interact with occupants, modeling and encouraging approbation behaviours.  Possibilities for distance <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>programmes in particular, emerged from this study of social navigation in LEEP.  This type of an analysis provides one way to answer Brown &amp; Duguid's question, &quot;Is there a class with this text?&quot; (<a href="#bro00">2000, p. 223</a>). </p> 

<p>Another point that has emerged from this study is that social navigation <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>support from a number of persistent structures.  Trying to support a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>using technological structures alone would be difficult in LEEP.  Administrative <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and persistent acitivities are also necessary. It takes all nine of the structures <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in the matrix above to support the type of social behaviours that <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in this <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> But, hopefully the matrix and its accompanying data illustrate that LEEP is more than a distance <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>programme, it is a vibrant social <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> a cyber-place where a variety of human <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>are occurring.</p>

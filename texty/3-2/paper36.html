<h1>Discovering the hidden secrets in your data - the data mining approach to information</font></h1>
<p>
<h4>Michael Lloyd-Williams<br>Department of Information Studies<br>University of Sheffield</h4>
<br><br>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> Nowadays, digital information is relatively easy to capture and
fairly inexpensive to store. The digital revolution has seen collections
of data grow in size, and the complexity of the data therein increase.
Advances in technology have resulted in our ability to meaningfully
analyse and understand the data we gather lagging far behind our
ability to capture and store these data  (<a href="#fayy1">Fayyad, <i>et al.</i> 1996</a>). A question commonly arising as a result of this state of affairs is, having gathered
such quantities of data, what do we actually do with it? (<a href="#fayy2">Fayyad &amp; Uthurasamy, 1996</a>)</p>

<p> It is often the case that large collections of data, however
well structured, conceal implicit patterns of information that
cannot be readily detected by conventional analysis techniques
(<a href="#lloy">Lloyd-Williams, <i>et al.</i>, 1995</a>). Such information may often be usefully analysed using a set of techniques referred to as <i>knowledge discovery</i> or<i>
data mining. </i>These techniques essentially seek to build a
better understanding of data, and in building characterisations
of data that can be used as a basis for further analysis (<a href="#limb">Limb & Meggs, 1995</a>),
extract <i>value</i> from <i>volume </i>(<a href="#scar">Scarfe & Shortland, 1995</a>). This paper describes a number of empirical studies of the use of the data mining approach
to the analyse of health information. The context is unimportant,
the examples described serving to highlight the factors perceived
as influencing the success or otherwise of the data mining approach
in each case, and to illustrate the generic difficulties that
may be encountered during the data mining process, and how these
difficulties may be overcome. </p>

<h2>Knowledge discovery and data mining</h2>

<p> It is generally accepted that the reason for capturing and storing
large amounts of data is due to the belief that there is valuable
information implicitly coded within it (<a href="#fayy2">Fayyad & Uthurasamy, 1996</a>). An important issue is therefore how is this hidden information (if it exists at all)
to be revealed? Traditional methods of knowledge generation rely
largely upon manual analysis and interpretation (<a href="#fayy1">Fayyad, et al</i>, 1996</a>). However, as data collections continue to grow in size and complexity, there
is a corresponding growing need for more sophisticated techniques
of analysis (<a href="#fayy1">Fayyad, <i>et al</i>, 1996</a>). One such innovative approach to the knowledge discovery process is known as <i>data mining</i>. </p>

<p> Data mining is essentially the computer-assisted process of information
analysis (<a href="#limb">Limb &amp; Meggs, 1995</a>) . This can be performed using either a top-down or a bottom-up approach. Bottom-up data mining analyses raw data
in an attempt to discover hidden trends and groups, whereas the
aim of top-down data mining is to test a specific hypothesis (<a href="#hedb">Hedberg, 1995</a>).
Data mining may be performed using a variety of techniques, including
intelligent agents, powerful database queries, and multi-dimensional
analysis tools (<a href="#watt">Watterson,1995</a>). Multi-dimensional analysis tools include the
use of neural networks, as described in this work. </p>

<p> The data mining approach expedites the initial stages of information
analysis, thereby quickly providing initial feedback that may
be further and more thoroughly investigated if appropriate. The
results obtained are not (unless otherwise specified) influenced
by preconceptions of the semantics of the data undergoing analysis.
Patterns and trends may therefore be revealed that may otherwise
remain undetected, and/or not considered. </p>

<p> It should be stated at this juncture that this paper advocates
the use of data mining techniques in <i>conjunction</i> with traditional
approaches to analysis, and not as a direct replacement. </p>

<h2>The knowledge discovery process</h2>

<p> According to researchers such as <a href="#fayy1">Fayyad, <i>et al</a></i> (1996), the
process of knowledge discovery via data mining can be divided
into four basic activities; <i>selection</i>, <i>pre-processing,</i>
<i>data mining</i>, and <i>interpretation</i>. These stages are
discussed in the following text. A graphical representation of
the general process is presented in Figure 1. </p>  


<h3>Selection</h3>

<p>Selection involves creating the target
data set, i.e. the data set to about undergo analysis. As discussed
previously, modern datasets may be both large and complex. Large
datasets which are not particularly complex may generally be subjected
in their entirety to the analysis process (subject to technical
constraints). Indeed, the larger the amount of available data,
the greater the likelihood that an identifiable trend or pattern
may be identified and statistically validated. However, if the
dataset is relatively complex, it is often considered impractical
to attempt to subject the complete dataset for analysis. It is
a common misconception to assume that the complete dataset should
be submitted to the data mining software, which in turn will automatically
resolve any problems and make sense of any inconsistencies. This
is not in fact the case, and is partly due to the probability
that the data represents a number of different aspects of the
domain which may not be directly related. Subjecting such data
to automated analysis may result in the identification of meaningless
patterns or trends, which in turn wastes time and effort. Careful
thought should therefore be given as to the purpose of the analysis
exercise, and a target dataset created which contains data that
reflects this purpose.</p>

<h3>Pre-processing</h3>

<p>Pre-processing involves preparing the dataset
for analysis by the data mining software to be used. This may
involve resolving undesirable data characteristics such as missing
data (non-complete fields), irrelevant fields, non-variant fields,
skewed fields, and outlying data points. The pre-processing activities
may result in the generation of a number of (potentially overlapping)
subsets of the original target dataset.</p>  

<p> Data fields are generally viewed as being complete if 70% or
more of the records contain values (<a href="#spss">SPSS Inc., 1995</a>). In cases where the field
is considered theoretically complete, but in fact is less than
100% complete, various techniques such as estimation, or assigning
the category mode are available for producing <i>synthetic</i>
data. The generation of accurate values to represent missing data
is currently one of the main research areas occupying the data
mining community (<a href="#fayy3">Fayyad, <i>et al</i>, 1996</a>).</p>  

<div><img src="mlwgif.gif" align="center"></div>
<div><br>Figure 1: Knowledge Discovery Overview</div>

<p> Depending upon the original source of the data, and the storage
format employed, pre-processing may also involve converting the
data into a format acceptable to the data mining software being
used. This initial collection and manipulation of data (during
the selection and pre-processing stages) in the data mining process
is sometimes referred to as <i>collection</i> and <i>cleaning</i>
[6]. </p> 

<h3>Data mining</h3> 

<p>This involves subjecting the cleaned data to analysis by the data mining software in an attempt to identify hidden trends or patterns, or to test specific hypotheses. It is recommended that any (apparently) significant results obtained are validated using traditional statistical techniques at this
stage. </p>

<h3>Interpretation</h3> 

<p>
This involves the analysis and interpretation
of the results produced. This may well involve returning to previous
stages to carry out additional activities in order to provide
further information if necessary.  </p>

<h2>Artificial Neural Networks</h2>

<p>Artificial neural networks are defined as information processing
systems inspired by the structure or architecture of the brain
(<a href="#caud">Caudill &amp; Butler, 1990</a>) . They are constructed from interconnecting processing elements which are analogous to neurones. The two main techniques employed
by neural networks are known as <i>supervised learning</i> and
<i>unsupervised</i> <i>learning</i>. </p>

<p> Supervised learning is essentially a two stage process; firstly
training the neural network to recognise different classes of
data by exposing it to a series of examples, and secondly, testing
how well it has learned from these examples by supplying it with
a previously unseen set of data. </p>

<p> Unsupervised learning is so called as the neural network requires
no initial information regarding the correct classification of
the data it is presented with. The neural network employing unsupervised
learning is able to analyse a multi-dimensional data set in order
to discover the natural clusters and sub-clusters that exist within
that data. Neural networks using this technique are able to identify
their own classification schemes based upon the structure of the
data provided, thus reducing its dimensionality. Unsupervised
pattern recognition is therefore sometimes called <i>cluster analysis</i>
(<a href="#back">Backer, 1978</a>). </p>

<p> The empirical studies presented in this paper were carried out primarily using the unsupervised learning technique based upon the Kohonen Self Organising Map. The principles underpinning the Kohonen Map have been described in some detail in works such as those by <a href="#koho">Kohonen</a> (1988) and <a href="#zupa">Zupan &amp: Gasteiger</a> (1993) , therefore only a brief description is provided here. The Kohonen Map is essentially constructed as a two dimensional grid of nodes. data are presented to each node in the grid simultaneously. Each node then competes in order to represent the data pattern currently being presented. One node will <i>win</i> this competition, and will have its parameters altered so that if this same data pattern were to appear again, the same node would have the best chance of winning. The overall effect is a two dimensional grid of nodes, that each respond to some subset or cluster of the incoming multidimensional data. Differing patterns are represented by nodes that are separated on the grid by varying distances, according to the level of difference. In summary, the Kohonen Map maps the high-dimensional continuous space occupied by the input data patterns into a lower-dimensional discrete space formed by an organised lattice of nodes (<a href="#wilk">Wilkins, <i>et al.</i>, 1993</a>). The Kohonen Map approach has been widely and successfully used in multivariate data analysis, and being closely related to other methods (such as the k-means type), is often seen as the best choice of analysis method from an interpretational point of view (<a href="#murt">Murtagh &amp: Hernández-Pajares, <i>et al.</i>, 1995</a>).</p>

<h2>Emprical studies</h2>

<p> This section present details of three empirical studies of the
use of the data mining approach in the analysis of health information.
The information analysed during these studies was extracted from
the World Health Organisation's <i>Health for All Database</i>,
<i>the Babies at Risk of Intrapartum Asphyxia</i> database, and
a series of databases containing infertility information. These
studies represent both successful and unsuccessful instances of
data mining activities, and are intended to assist in highlighting
the factors perceived as influencing the outcome of each of the
projects concerned.</p>

<h3>The <i>Health for All</i> database</h3>

<p> The World Health Organisation's (WHO) <i>Health for All (HFA)
</i>Database was created to make health-related data collected
by the WHO available to outside users. The Database contains statistical
indicators for the WHO HFA targets relating to Health-for-All
in Europe by the year 2000. These include: better health, mortality/morbidity,
lifestyles conducive to health, healthy environment, health services,
and health policies. Other statistical indicators relate to demographics,
socio-economics and other supplementary health-related information.
Data are present for all European countries and includes those
countries in existence before, and after the recent political
changes in central and eastern Europe as well as the former Soviet
Republics. Data are included from 1970 to 1993 inclusive, although
it is important to note that there are gaps in the data that are
available. </p>

 <p>The approach taken to analyse the HFA database generally corresponded
with that illustrated in Figure 1. During the selection process,
mortality data relating to the following conditions was extracted
form the HFA database; life expectancy at birth; probability of
dying before five years of age; infant mortality; post-neonatal
mortality; standardised death rates (SDR) for circulatory diseases;
SDR for malignant neoplasms; SDR for external causes of injury
and poisoning; SDR for suicide and self-inflicted injury. </p>

<p> Data were extracted for 39 European countries. Although a far
higher number of countries are represented on the Database, the
data could only be considered complete for 39 of them. The data
were then converted into a format acceptable to the software being
used. An underlying aim of the study was to track any changes
in the data that may have occurred over the years for the same
samples of countries in order to examine whether any patterns
identified remained consistent over time. This necessitated the
selection of data that were separated by intervals of three to
four years (where possible) since it was expected that changes,
if any, would be more apparent on this time scale. Three years
were chosen, giving three subsets of data (1982, 1986, and 1989).
The extracted data was then analysed by custom written Kohonen
Self Organising Map software in order to identify possible groupings.
Finally, standard statistical techniques were used to evaluate
the validity of the groupings. This investigation therefore made
use of the bottom-up data mining approach described previously.</p>


<p> Preliminary work resulted in two distinct groups or clusters of countries in each year being apparent (<a href="#lloy2">Lloyd-Williams, <i>et al.</i>, 1996</a>). It was observed that all countries in the first of the groups were from Central and Eastern Europe or from the former Soviet Republics, while all countries in the second group were from Northern (i.e., the Nordic countries), Western, or Southern Europe. A two-sample t-test was used to validate the groupings identified. The results obtained confirmed that the identified groups were significantly different or separated from each other.</p>

<p> In addition to the geographical division, the classification also appeared to reflect differences in wealth. Countries in the first of the groups were relatively poor; all countries (excluding the former Soviet Union) had GNP per capita of less than US$5,000 in 1989 (the latest year for which GNP figures were available). Countries in the second of the groups were relatively wealthy; all countries had GNP per capita exceeding US$5,000 (except Portugal, whose 1989 GNP per capita is just under US$4,300). A t-test was performed, and the result indicated a significant difference between the two groups in terms of GNP per capita. The observation that the classification appeared to reflect two different GNP groups suggested that GNP could be inter-related with the health indicators. In order to further explore this possibility, the coefficient of correlation was calculated between GNP and all seven HFA indicators used in the initial analysis. Results obtained indicated that GNP is strongly and positively correlated with life expectancy, and strongly but negatively correlated with the SDR for diseases of the circulatory system. A small and positive correlation was found to exist between GNP and the SDR for malignant neoplasms, but fairly large negative correlations between GNP and all the other indicators, except the SDR for suicide and self-inflicted injury. Overall, the available data indicated that death rates for malignant neoplasms tended to rise with increasing affluence, while death rates for other diseases tended to fall.</p>

<p> Further work was then performed in order to obtain a finer classification. This work resulted in the identification of six groups, which were essentially sub-divisions of the two groups produced by the
preliminary work (<a href="#lloy3">Lloyd-Williams &amp; Williams, 1996</a>). Characteristics of the groups ranged from the lowest life expectancy, coupled with the highest probability of dying before five and infant mortality rate, to the highest mean life expectancy, coupled with the lowest probability of dying before five, and infant mortality rate. Over time, mean life expectancy increased, while the probability of dying before five and infant mortality rate both decreased for all groups. Detailed summary statistics of each group may be found elsewhere (<a href="#willi">Williams, 1995</a>)</p>

<p> Group membership of all six groups remained relatively stable over the period under consideration. Eight of the 39 countries did experience movement between groups over the years, however in all such cases, cumulative movement was limited to an adjacent group. </p>

 <p>In order to validate the groupings identified, Euclidean distances
were calculated, and the generalised t-test used to test if the
underlying means of each group pair were significantly different
from each other. Results obtained confirm that the identified
groups were significantly different or separated from each other.
The classifications obtained can therefore be said to be valid
based upon the available data.</p>  

<p> The success of the application of the data mining approach to
the analysis of the HFA database may be attributed to a number
of factors as follows. Careful initial data selection and associated
pre-processing ensured that that the target dataset was largely
complete, containing only highly relevant data appropriate to
the investigation. No non-variant or skewed fields were included.
Similarly, no fields in the available data contained outlying
data points. The dataset processed could therefore in this instance
be viewed as being an ideal subject for the data mining. </p>

<h3>The <em>Babies at Risk of Intrapartum Asphyxia </em>database</h3>

<p> The <i>Babies at Risk of Intrapartum Asphyxia</i> database was
analysed in conjunction with staff at the Sheffield Children's
Hospital. This database contains data collected from a wider study
on the relationship between intrapartum asphyxia and neonatal
encephalopathy. Neonatal encephalopathy is a condition characterised
by impairment of consciousness, abnormalities of muscle tone and
of feeding. There is also frequent evidence of injury to other
organs such as the heart, kidney, and gastrointestinal system.
Neonatal encephalopathy is thought to arise when there is significant
intrapartum asphyxia, that is, the foetus is deprived of oxygen
during labour. </p>

<p> The <i>Babies at Risk of Intrapartum Asphyxia</i> database contains
detailed obstetric data, including cardiotocogram (CTG) traces
taken during labour. Both the foetal heart rate (FHR) and the
uterine contractions are represented on the trace produced. Also
present on the database are pre-labour assessments of maternal
and antenatal risk factors that might influence the outcome of
the labour. Factors relating to the quality of intrapartum obstetric
care are also recorded.</p> 

<p> In order to construct the database, the CTG traces were analysed
by dividing each trace into thirty-minute epochs, and then examining
each epoch for abnormal FHR patterns. A <i>severity score</i>
was then applied to each abnormality detected. Each of the 128
patients represented on the database is therefore associated with
a number of epochs, the average being fourteen (the minimum being one,
and the maximum being forty). Each epoch in turn is further described
using a number of parameters presenting various aspects of the
associated FHR. </p>

<p> All the activities relating to data capture, analysis, and initial
database construction were carried out by medical staff involved
in the wider study on the relationship between intrapartum asphyxia
and neonatal encephalopathy. The target dataset was therefore
created primarily for use within this study, rather than for analysis
using neural networks.</p> 

<p> Due to the purpose of the main study, much of the data represented
on the database are encoded, rather than being specifically represented.
For instance, the baseline FHR in beats per minute (bpm) recorded
on the database varies from 100-109 at the lowest level, to &gt;180
at its highest. The baseline FHR is recorded on a scale of -2
(representing 100-109 bpm) to +3 (representing &gt;180 bpm). These
figures represent whether or not the baseline FHR is slower or
faster than would be expected. The bradycardia parameter is used
to indicate a slow FHR (&lt; 100 bpm). In the absence of bradycardia,
this parameter is set to zero (normal). A period of greater than
three minutes with recovery is represented by a value of +3, and
a value of +4 if there is no recovery. This use of a zero value
to indicate a normal reading is employed in a large proportion
of the parameters of the database. </p>

<p> The Kohonen Self Organising Map software employed to analyse
the dataset expects the data therein to be presented on an interval
or ordinal scale. That is, that the range of parameter values
stand in some relationship to each other. The software also expects
values that lie adjacent to each other within a parameter range
to be similar to each other. However, some parameters on the database
occupy a nominal scale where parameter values do not relate to
each other. For instance, the uterine contractions parameter is
represented as zero (normal), +3 (over-contracting), or +1 (the
recording of the contraction on the trace is technically poor).
This parameter was therefore considered to be inappropriate for
use in its existing form, and removed from the target dataset.</p>

<p> Initial analysis work was not without its difficulties due to
the nature of the data involved. At one stage of processing, 52%
of the available dataset presented parameters that were all set
to zero (indicating a normal response), apart from the baseline
FHR. This extremely high level of non-variant data resulted in
no discernible patterns being detectable at the early stage of
work. </p>

<p> After performing further selection and pre-processing activities
(including the removal of the majority of non-variant data), some
success was achieved. Two distinct groups were identified within
the database, and their existence statistically validated using
a two-sample t-test. Further work involved the training of a neural
network employing the radial basis function (RBF) approach to
recognise the two groups, and to differentiate between members
of these groups. During this period, an overall probability of
correct recognition of 85% was achieved, providing further evidence
that the groups identified did exist within the database.</p> 

<p> Further work on the database resulted in a refinement of the
original two groups being achieved. The resulting four groups
were again found to be statistically different from each other,
each exhibiting specific combinations of FHR patterns. The use
of the RBF software again resulted in successful identification
of the groups, with 100% of records within the first group, 97%
of records within the second group, and 99% of records within
the third and fourth groups being correctly identified. </p>

<p> Although the identification of statistically valid groups may
indicate that this data mining exercise was successful, it should
be noted that the data used to obtain these groups represented
only a proportion of that available. The high proportion of non-variant
data present precluded much of the database from being used in
the analysis process. Further limiting factors in this case included
the use of a nominal scale to represent certain parameters. The
fact that the data provided had already undergone pre-coding also
restricted the ability to perform any subsequent meaningful data
manipulation, as the original data values were in many instances
unknown.</p> 

<h3>Infertility databases</h3>

<p> Despite recent improvements in infertility diagnosis and the
increase in sophistication and variety of treatment techniques,
there still appears to be great difficulty in successfully predicting
how a particular patient will respond to a specific course of
treatment. Although many types of data can be collected which
in theory are relevant to the likelihood of successful treatment,
in reality the complexity of the interactions between these parameters
appear to be beyond the capabilities of conventional methods of
analysis. The primary aim of this investigation was therefore
to investigate the use of the data mining approach in assisting
in the prediction of whether a specific patient would be successfully
treated using a particular treatment pathway. Against this background,
three databases holding data relating to three different aspects
of infertility diagnosis and treatment were provided for analysis
using the data mining approach.</p> 

<p> The first of these databases contained details of patients who
had undergone ovulation induction with gonadotrophins. This database
was analysed in conjunction with staff at the Jessop Hospital,
Sheffield. This database holds 17 parameters for each of the 122
patients represented, including information relating to the treatment
outcome, i.e. whether the patient became pregnant or not. The
main objective of this study was to attempt to identify the combination
of characteristics that appeared to indicate a successful treatment
outcome.</p>

<p> A second database containing details of patients who had undergone
stimulated cycles of IVF treatment was analysed in conjunction
with staff at St. Michael's Hospital, Bristol. Each of the 403
patients represented on this database had three fertilised eggs
implanted (the optimal number to achieve one successful pregnancy
whilst avoiding multiple pregnancies). For each patient, there
were therefore four possible outcomes (0-3 pregnancies). The main
aim of this study was to identify the characteristics of patients
who are most likely to achieve a single successful pregnancy,
the clinicians wishing to avoid the potential for multiple (and
hence possibly complicated) pregnancies.</p> 

<p> A third database containing details of 65 patients who had undergone
natural cycle IVF treatment was also analysed in conjunction with
staff at St. Michael's Hospital, Bristol. Each patient is represented
on the database by 12 parameters and a corresponding diagnostic
category (endometriosis, tubal damage, or unexplained infertility).
The aim of this study was slightly different fro the previous
two described in attempting to determine whether the specific
combination of 12 parameter values could be associated with the
diagnostic category of the patient. </p>

<p> The data mining approach failed to provide the information that
was specifically required in all three of the cases described.
During the initial stages of investigation, all three datasets
appeared initially to be highly suitable for analysis using the
data mining approach. Despite the fact that some parameters represented
data values using a nominal scale, the original databases exhibited
little missing data, few irrelevant fields, no non-variant fields,
few skewed fields, and few outlying data points. Any limited undesirable
characteristics originally present were removed during the selection
and pre-processing activities.</p>

<p> The main problem encountered during this investigation appears
to be fundamental in that the patterns representing the information
required were not evident within the available datasets. It was
therefore concluded that the data mining approach was unable to
assist in the analysis of the data provided. This appeared to
be primarily due to the fact that the range of factors that fully
determine a couple's ability to conceive is not known. It is therefore
reasonable to assume that in this case, the pattern (or a recognisable
proportion) formed by these factors is not present in the data
currently being accumulated by the clinical staff. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p> This paper has provided an introduction to the concepts of knowledge
discovery and data mining. The empirical studies presented are
intended to highlight the factors perceived as contributing to
the success or otherwise of the data mining approach. </p>

<p> It should be evident from the studies described that the potential
for success is largely determined prior to the actual data mining
activity, i.e. during the activities performed in the production
of the cleaned data. Extreme care should therefore be taken during
the selection and pre-processing activities in order to ensure
wherever possible that the target dataset actually contains relevant
and usable data, and that these data are in a form suitable for
use. </p>

<p> This latter point is particularly relevant, as the form required
by the providers may not be compatible with that required for
the data mining process. This was evidenced by the analysis of
the Babies at Risk of Intrapartum Asphyxia database, where coding
activities performed as a result of a wider study precluded much
of the data from analysis by neural networks. The likelihood of
success of a data mining project  is therefore highly dependent
upon the quality and format of the data made available.</p>

<p> It is also apparent from these studies (and in particular, the
analysis of the infertility databases), that if the data provided
does not contain useful information within the context of the
focus of the investigation, then the use of neural networks cannot
generate such information any more than traditional analysis techniques
can. However, it may well be the case that the use of neural networks
for data mining allows this conclusion to be reached more quickly
than might ordinarily be the case. </p>

<p> Finally, it should be stated once more that this paper advocates
the use of data mining as an approach that can be used to expedite
the initial stages of information analysis in order that the results
obtained may be more thoroughly investigated. It should be used
in conjunction with traditional approaches, not in direct competition.</p>

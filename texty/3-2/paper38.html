<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This article describes on-going research on the development of
a library strategy for universities in Ghana.  The research focuses
on the factors affecting  the development of a strategic planning
process aimed at improving the libraries' capacity to deliver
information services effectively and efficiently. Since the structure
of universities in Ghana is, to a great extent, derived from or
modelled on that of universities in the United Kingdom the project
of necessity also includes some consideration of  current attitudes
to the strategic planning process in a number of  university libraries
in the United Kingdom. It is hoped that the study and evaluation
of this aspect of the management of United Kingdom university
libraries may provide pertinent guidelines for university library
management in Ghana.</p>


<h2>Problems facing University libraries in Ghana</h2>

<p>The main problem facing university libraries in Ghana in the 1990's
is their inability to acquire library materials and to provide
information services even at the levels achieved as long ago as
the late 1950s. Amongst the many reasons for this the most important
has been government instability, particularly during the period
between 1966 and 1983 when various governments, mainly led by
the military,  showed little regard for higher education and universities
were consequently inadequately funded.  Additionally, student
involvement in the political struggle against military rule also
had adverse consequences on university and university library
development since universities were closed down on a number of
 occasions, in some cases for months on end. Closely related to
Ghana's political instability has been the gradual and persistent
decline in the country's economy. When it achieved independence
from Britain in 1957 Ghana inherited an economy that was seen
as among the best of all the developing countries. Its per capita
national income of &#163;70 in 1960, for example, was significantly
higher than that of Egypt (&#163;56), Nigeria (&#163;29) or India
(&#163;25) (Huq, 1989: 2). However, the national currency, the
cedi, which averaged 350 to the US dollar in 1990 was, by the
middle of December, 1996, trading at 1,725 to the dollar (<a href="#fina">Financial
Times, 1996</a>).</p>

<p>One result of this has been the inability of the universities
and their libraries to purchase computers, books, other information
products and to develop their communication infrastructure owing
to the constant shortage of foreign exchange.  This economic predicament
has also affected the purchasing power of the salaries and wages
of Ghanaian workers, resulting in negative organisational behaviour
(<a href="#kiss">Kissiedu, 1994</a>).  In a situation where a worker's official monthly
pay-cheque is barely sufficient to maintain him for  a week, the
need to look elsewhere to make up the considerable shortfall has
resulted in conflicts between  employer and the employees.  People
work for the minimum number of hours at their 'official' jobs
and then spend the rest of the time at all kinds of 'extra' personal
pursuits just to make ends meet.</p>

<p>Absenteeism, bad time keeping at all levels and lax supervision
at senior level are all manifestations of the frustration, lack
of commitment, absence of direction and laziness that dominate
the university labour scene, resulting in a drastic decline in
the effectiveness of universities and their libraries as institutions
of higher education.</p>

<p>Other demographic issues such as a decrease in the number of university
staff and a 30% increase in the size of the student population,
a result of a government directive to the universities to absorb
the back-log of two successive A' Level cohorts who had not gained
admission to the universities because of university closures over
the years (an increase not matched by increases in funding) have
had a serious affect on library accommodation..  University libraries
that were built to cater for about 2,000 students in the middle
of the twentieth century now have to accommodate about 7,000 students.</p>

<p> In the global context too, the cost of books, periodicals and
other library materials and equipment has risen steeply.  New
technologies are changing the ways information is generated, recorded,
gathered, stored, preserved, analysed, disseminated and used by
people and consequently the ways in which libraries are expected
to provide access to information. Economic conditions have effectively
prevented Ghanaian university libraries from developing such services
at the required level so far. </p>

<p>In the midst of all these environmental uncertainties and turbulence,
typical of most African and other developing countries (<a href="#flor">Flores,
1972</a>; <a href="#osha">O'Shaughnessy, 1985</a>; <a href="#yava">Yavas, Kaynak and Dibe, 1985</a>; <a href="#adeg">Adegbite,
1986</a>), universities in Ghana are trying to develop a management
culture which they hope will improve university management in
terms of planning, cost effectiveness, efficiency and accountability.
It is against this background that universities and their university
libraries in Ghana have become involved in the strategic planning
process. </p>

<h2>Theoretical perspective</h2>

<p><a href="#genu">Genus</a> (1995) presents five varieties of approach to strategy formulation:</p>

<ul>
<li>i)    Linear(or 'rational') planning

<li>ii)  Adaptive/Incremental view

<li>iii)  Interpretative view

<li>iv)  Systems thinking

<li>v) 'Garbage can' and population ecology view (<a href="#genu">Genus, 1995:10</a>)
</ul>

<p>However the dominant approach to strategy in the main stream textbooks
has been the linear approach (<a href="#whit">Whittington, 1993</a>).  Labelled 'linear'
by <a href="#chaf">Chaffee</a> (1983), 'rational' by <a href="#pete">Peters and Waterman</a> (1982), 'formal'
by many others and the 'planning mode' by <a href="#mint73">Mintzberg</a> (1973), this
classical approach to strategy has been defined by <a href="#chan">Chandler</a> (1962)
as: </p>

<blockquote>&quot;...the determination of the basic, long-term goals
and     objectives of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses
of action and the allocation of  measures necessary for those
goals.&quot;     (<a href="#chan">Chandler, 1962:13</a>)</blockquote>

<p>Based on Chandler's definition, the linear approach assumes three
basic tenets:</p>

<blockquote>Strategy formulation should be a controlled process of thought,
derived directly from the notion of rational economic man- strategy
as product of a single entrepreneurial individual acting with
perfect rationality to maximise 'his' economic advantage.</blockquote>


<blockquote>Strategies emerge from the decision-making process fully formulated,
explicit and articulated: strategies are in a sense orders for
others to carry out</blockquote>

<blockquote>Implementation is a distinct phase in the strategy process
only coming after the earlier phase of explicit and conscious
formulation.  (<a href="#mint90">Mintzberg, 1990</a>)</blockquote>

<p>The stages involved in linear planning are shown in figure 1.</p>

<p>Several authors have defined strategy in terms of the relationship
between an organisation and its environment.  One such definition
is:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The positioning and relating of the firm/organisation
to its environment in a way which will assure its continued success
and make it secure from surprises&quot; (Ansoff, 1984)</blockquote>

<p>The environment therefore dictates what are called key success
factors - the factors that an organisation really needs to address
for long-term competitive advantage or strategic success (Thompson,
1990).</p>

<p>Wheelan and Hunger (1990) discuss these factors under external
and internal environments.  The external environment consists
of variables that are outside the organisation and not within
the short-term control of top-management.  It has two parts: the
task environment and the societal environment.  The task environment
involves those elements or groups that directly affect and are
affected by an organisation's major operations such as stake-holders,
governments, suppliers, competitors, customers, interest groups,
unions and associations.  The societal environment variables include
economic, sociocultural, technological and political/legal forces.
 These do not directly touch on the short-term activities of the
organisation but they can, and often do, influence its long-term
decisions.  The internal environment variables form the context
in which work is done and include the organisation's structure,
culture and resources.</p>

<p>Applying this theory to the study of libraries, Vincent (1988)
identified specific variables that affect the success of strategy
in libraries in a multiple case study in which she concludes that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lack of resources is one reason why libraries may be reluctant
to engage in strategic planning.</li>
<li>The stability of the environment and sufficient control over
it ensures the attainment of organisational objectives hence strategy
formulation.</li>

<li>Publicly funded service organisations have a relationship
with the environment which is often characterised by turbulence,
unpredictability and the imposition of short-term objectives and
structures which, bear little relation to the dependant organisations'
circumstances.</li>

<li>Success of strategy in libraries is affected by weight of
tradition, vested interests and corporate expectations.

<li>A single, agreed, clearly articulated mission is an essential
prerequisite for successful strategic planning. (Vincent, 1988:
42-43)</li>
</ul>

<p>Ferguson (1992), writing on strategic planning for libraries in
developing countries, states that strategic planning is affected
by basic influences, namely: the fundamental socio-economic characteristic
and purpose of the organisation, the values and philosophy of
management and the organisations strengths and weaknesses in the
light of the external and internal environments.  He states further
that strategic planning is likely to be affected by the location
of the organisation because these factors vary with different
cultural socio-economic and historical environments.</p>

<p>Wilks (1990) also finds that the Anglo-Saxon cultures of the United
States and the United Kingdom are biased towards an individualistic
free-enterprise model of strategy that denigrates explicit reliance
upon the state.</p>

<p>
It is therefore proposed that if the success of strategic planning
is affected by environmental factors then the model as it is presently
applied in United Kingdom university libraries will not translate
to Ghana because of its goal of profit maximisation (Ansoff, 1965;
Porter, 1980, 1985), insensitivity to sociological culture (Whittington,
1993),  its assumption of the availability of considerable resources
of time, people, money and expertise (Grant, 1991b) and its reliance
on stable political and economic domains (Cyert and March, 1963;
Boyacigiller and Alders, 1991).</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<h3>Research Design</h3>

<p>This study adopts a multiple case study approach since this permits
the use of a combination of varied data collection techniques.
 Ford (1977),  among others,  has advocated the use of such  a
multimethod approach and asserts that  &quot;... a combination
of methods is often more appropriate in order to make use of their
different advantages and to encounter the individual weaknesses
and biases of a method used in isolation.&quot;   Some traditional
prejudices against the case study strategy has been debated in
sociological studies since the idea was first developed by Bronislow,
Malinowski, Frederic le Play and some members of the Chicago school
(Hamel et al., 1993:2).  The two most basic shortcomings faults
of the approach debated in the literature can be summarised as:</p>

<blockquote>its lack of representativeness and especially the lack of
representativeness of the case used as a point of observation
for the social phenomenon or issues constituting the object of
study.</blockquote>


<blockquote>Its lack of methodological rigor - rigor in the collection,
construction and analysis of the empirical materials that give
rise to this study.  This lack of rigor is linked to the problem
of bias.  Such bias is introduced by the subjectivity of the researcher,
as well as of the field informants on whom the researcher relies
to get an understanding of the case under investigation. (Hamel
et al., 1993)</blockquote>

<p>In the present study the following procedures have been used:</p>

<p>1. The research has been guided by a theoretical proposition.
A series of research questions based on the study's research objectives
were used to collect the data which would be used to prove or
disprove the proposition made.  Yin (1989:70-80) refers to this
as a 'case study protocol'.</p>

<p>2.  The problem of representativeness is overcome by the use of
both the interpretative and positivist methods. Smith (1989) and
Walsham (1993) have argued that epistemology,  the basis of one's
claim of knowledge  and research methods are interrelated.  If
one adopts only a positivist epistemological stance then statistical
generalisability is the key goal.  However, if one assumes an
interpretative position as is the case in the first phase of this
research, then the validity of an extrapolation from an individual
case or cases depends not on the representativeness of such cases
in a statistical sense, but on the plausibility and cogency of
the logical reasoning used in describing the results from the
cases and in drawing conclusions from them.</p>

<p>3. The multisite and external validity measures adopted have,
it is believed, contributed to the reliability of the findings.
 The study is uses five cases in Ghana and five in the United
Kingdom.  None of the cases has not been considered as a sample.
 In-depth study has been carried out in each case by utilising
four modes of data collection techniques.  The investigation has
striven to generalise a set of results to its broad theoretical
proposition for its first case study.  The resultant theories
from the first case have been tested in the subsequent cases,
the intention being to discover whether the same results would
occur in at least three cases to achieve literal replication.
 Yin (1994) refers to this manner of achieving representativeness
as external validity and states that:</p>

<blockquote>&quot; A theory must be tested through replications of the findings
in a second or even a third neighbourhood, where the theory has
specified that the same results should occur.  Once such replication
has been made, the results might be accepted for a much larger
number of similar neighbourhoods, even though further replications
have not been performed.  This replication logic is the same that
underlines the use of experiments (and allows scientists to generalise
one experiment to another)&quot; (Yin, 1994:33)</blockquote>

<h3>Mixed methodology</h3>

<p>The methodology combines qualitative and quantitative approaches
in one single study.  This combination of research methods in
the same phenomenon has been called triangulation by Denzin (1978).
The research is, therefore, based on both the interpretative and
positivist paradigms.  This concept of mixing methods has stimulated
much debate in the social sciences (Guba, 1992; Patton, 1988).
 Reichardt and Cook (1979) advocate a choice of one or the other
rather than combining them.  Rossman and Wilson (1985) and Lancy
(1993) assume a pragmatic stance and argue that a false dichotomy
exists between qualitative and quantitative approaches and that
researchers should make the most efficient use of both paradigms
in understanding social phenomena. </p> 

<p>This study has applied these two methods appropriately at different
stages of the research.  The interpretative has been used in an
exploratory fashion to investigate the factors that affect strategy
in Ghanaian universities.  The search for literature on strategic
planning in university libraries in Ghana produced nothing of
relevance.  The lack of prior research and the desire and need
to explore the opinions of key university personnel indicated
that an interpretative study had to be done.  The results of the
interpretative study were then used as the basis for a large positivist
study of the same research questions.</p>

<h3>Selection of cases and subjects</h3>

<p>Five cases each were selected for the study in the United Kingdom
and Ghana.  These were libraries which were believed to be either
going through the strategic planning process or about to start
on it.  The subjects in the Ghanaian situation were the major
stake-holders of the university libraries who at the period of
conducting the interviews (Jan-March 1996) were influential in
matters regarding university and library policies, decision-making,
funding/disbursement of funds, employment/promotion and all general
matters affecting  the libraries directly or indirectly.  Some
senior executives of the Ministries of Finance and Education in
Ghana were also interviewed.  In all, 63 individuals employed
in the five universities in Ghana were interviewed.  The university
librarians and their deputies were selected for the UK interviews.
 Using a semi-structured interview schedule a broad spectrum of
subjects was covered and the interviewees were invited to discuss
their experiences of the management of universities and their
libraries principally in relation to:</p>

<pre width=132>
External environment                Goals/objectives of                  
                                    universities/libraries               

Political changes-macro and micro   Strategic plans of                   
levels                              universities/libraries               

Funding of universities/libraries   Vision statements                    

Library infrastructure              Mission statements

Information Technology                                                   
</pre>

<p>Documentary evidence was also collected and used to inform discussion of 
the Ghanaian environment and the libraries' internal environments.
Strategic planning documents of the cases in UK and Ghana were
also analysed.  On some occasions non-participant observation;
although this was occasional, casual and informal some organisational
habits were noted.  These two instruments were used to corroborate
and augment evidence from the other sources of data collection.

<div>Table 1  Questionnaire-distribution and responses</div>

<p>A fourth instrument used was a questionnaire.  The questionnaires
were distributed to a larger population of  library staff in all
the five cases in Ghana.  This population consisted of all categories
of professional, sub-professional and non-professional library
staff.  Table 1 shows the distribution of the questionnaires by
library as well as the number of responses. A very high response
was achieved. A second set of questionnaires was mailed to the
respondents when it became necessary to test new findings of the
qualitative investigation.  Responses to these are currently awaited.</p>


<h2>Interim results and conclusion</h2>

<p>An initial analysis of the interview data using some aspects of
the grounded theory technique (Glaser and Strauss, 1967) produced
the following provisional findings which were tested in the quantitative
phase:</p>

<h3>1    Vision for university/library</h3>

<p>A considerable proportion of university staff  would like to see
an expansion of university and library physical facilities compared
with the government officials surveyed who foresaw cuts in university
funding in favour of increased expenditure on primary and secondary
education.</p>

<h3>2.   Staff awareness of and participation in strategic planning</h3>

<p>Not all the library staff took part in the strategic planning
process.  Professional librarians participated more significantly
in the planning process than the staff at lower levels. There
appears to be a significant correlation between participation
in the planning process and the educational level of staff.  The
majority of the library staff were not aware of the existence
of any strategic planning documents.</p>

<h3>3.  Organisational culture</h3>

<p> There is a bureaucratic task type of organisational structure
in libraries. The working environment is mechanistic,  with staff
 having narrowly defined functions and a set of job descriptions.
 Within a hierarchical staff structure the  management style is
autocratic and is not conducive to participation.</p>

<h3>4.  Funding</h3>

<p>Libraries exist in a highly unstable economic environment. The
low levels of resource allocation to universities is a result
of the poor relationship between government and universities.
Monthly payment of government subventions to universities makes
long-term planning difficult. Libraries have no control over their
own resources and have no reserves or surpluses to support new
initiatives.</p>

<h3>5.  Politics</h3>

<p>Recent changes in government educational policies have had a significant
impact on the rate university growth and development. The national
government accords education a high priority but the majority
of those surveyed believed it had a low regard for university
education. Strike action by local political groups is a major
cause of disruptions in library services and development. Some
teaching staff have a very low opinion of the library which is
reflected in the poor allocation of resources for library operations.</p>

<h3>6.  External factors</h3>

<p>The political and economic sectors of the environment have had
a more significant impact on universities/libraries than the other
three sectors ( technology, social and international). The university
stake-holders reported that of the five environment factors the
international environment has been the most favourable to universities
and libraries. It was felt that the universities/libraries needed
to deal more with the political and economic factors of the environment
than with the other three.</p>

<h3>7.  Information Technology</h3>

<p>There is a low level of computer technology application in the
university libraries. No library housekeeping services have been
automated in any of the university libraries. A substantial proportion
of the library staff do not use computers in their work.  There
is a low level of technology and management education among library
staff.  The technology required to systematically monitor the
environment and to collect necessary is lacking.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The analysis of the  interviews with university librarians in
the United Kingdom has not yet been completed and the supplementary
questionnaires from Ghana are still outstanding.  It is hoped
to publish the final results and discussion of the findings in
a future issue of <i>Information Research.</i></p>

<blockquote>This article presents the lessons learned when six universitiesin the West Midlands, UK worked collaboratively within the eLib (<a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/services/elib/">Electronic Libraries Programme</a>).  These libraries and learning resource centres spent two years focused on a culture change in the support provided to <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span> law, and life sciences subject departments.

<h2>Attitudes</h2>

<p><b><i>Management:</i>  </b>Change required a commitment from senior management
within their libraries and learning resource centres.  This commitment
was unlikely if  <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span> were less than 100% in favour of change.
 Early adoption of technology remained costly, thus posing a threat
to <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>finances. Heads of LIS (Library and Information Services)
met regularly to share plans and <span>concerns</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span> This collaborative
<span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>resulted in positive <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>about a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>of networked
information services.  Managers received comfort in knowing what
others were doing.  It was not just a matter of &quot;keeping
up&quot;, it was a means of assuring a tested way forward. </p> 

<p>Managers practised their commitment.  Early in the change process
they adopted e-mail communication and Web access from their desktops.
 They began to share a language which encompassed networked resources
and access.  They asked for outputs from staff which indicated
the importance they placed upon the Internet.</p>

<p>At this <span>writing</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span> less is known about the managers of the subject
departments.  An <i><a href="http://www.uce.ac.uk/tapin/impact.htm">Impact Study</a></i> is due out in February (note that this link will not work before then).
 However, it <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>that the subject department heads had a
wide <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>in their understanding and appreciation of networked
information in <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning.  No &quot;champion&quot;
among <span>equals</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>surfaced, and in fact the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot;Luddite&quot;
was occasionally heard.  The subject department heads were consumed
with the management of devolved budgets and meeting enrolment
targets.  This fostered a closed shop attitude.  The outward searching
and collaborative processes used by the LIS managers was not present.</p>

<p>The <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>of senior managers in computing services likewise
varied.  Less enthusiasm for change emerged than <span>expected</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>  Perhaps
a threat was perceived in  new <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>in networked information
support.  More likely, the IT services  were faced with such colossal
changes they did not actively encourage uptake in networked behaviours.
 This would have increased the demand on their services, which
they were already working full out to provide.</p>  

<p>The LIS managers <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>of the subject department
heads and heads of computing.  They were positive and non-confrontational
and <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>in step with university <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>and policies.</p>

<p><b><i>Professional staff:</i> </b>The LIS professional staff were cautious
about Web resources and services.  Their initial <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>were
apprehension and <span>doubt</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>  It was clear this would only change when
they received hands on training with networked resources.  Without
computers on their desks they had a <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>and commercial vision
of the Web.  They were not in a position to control change, yet
they knew change was imminent.  This increased their negative
<span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>resistance</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>  The <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>of their senior managers
and a forty-hour training programme moved things on.  This programme
<span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>the same benefits experienced by their managers in their
own collaborative meetings.  It took eight months to begin to
see the positive messages in LIS professional staff communications
and <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>  It took 10 months to enlist their enthusiasm.
 By the end of one full year their <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>had matured to reflect
the wisdom of experience.</p>

<h2>Infrastructure</h2>

<p><b><i>Networked campus:</i>  </b>Which came first, the attitude change
or the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>networks?  Both scenarios were true in the TAPin
project.  Some <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>were well <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>in their network
<span>hardware</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>software</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span> others were still laying cable two years
ago.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>culture change occurred in both; however, the universities
where <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>preceded <span>hardware</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>experienced the greatest change.
 Perhaps this was because they had further to go.  Even so, it
was the vision to use new resources that fostered implementation.
 Attitudes before <span>hardware</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>meant new behaviours were placed along0e
new technology.<b>  </b>This sustained the first year of change.
 If the campus networks were not in place by year two, it was
unlikely that libraries and information resource centres would
have moved to Web access.  Telneting was not acceptable for regular
access and development work.  Reliable e-mail and Web servers
underwrote the other four points in this article.</p>

<p><b><i>Standards:  </i></b>The eLib programme <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>early on the importance of seamless access.  <a href="http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/services/elib/papers/other/standards/intronew.html">UKOLN has collected opinions and written in this area</a>.  These were loosely <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>in the project.  The important point was compatibility between machines crossing service boundaries.  When the LIS professionals accessed the Web through interfaces at variance with their end-users, difficulties
resulted.  These were only resolved when the LIS staff learned to use a variety of interfaces or tailored their support. These LIS staff initially doubted the functionality of the Web.  Their attitude change was not helped when cross campus platforms varied.   There was little the libraries and learning centre managers could do to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>these problems.  Unfortunately the change process involved everyone's ability to cope.</p>

<p><b><i>End-user machines:  </i></b>The absence of desk top access for LIS professionals and academics was a barrier to culture change.  When a networked 486 or faster <span>PC</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>or MAC was readily available new behaviours were possible.  Web access services required machines running Windows with  Web browsers and e-mail <span>software</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>  Other <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>was also beneficial, such as Adobie Acrobat editor and reader, <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>authoring <span>tools</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span> PowerPoint, and <span>FTP</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>packages. Two years on we are looking at Windows '95, MS Office '97 and Web management <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>like FrontPage.  These would quickly exceed the capacity of the machines on desktops today.  No one knows where, if, or when this will settle to a <span>reasonable</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>expense for LIS and subject departments. </p>

<h2>Staff Skills</h2>

<p>The endless requirement to upgrade staff skills <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>on from
the <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>upgrades in IT.  Perceptions and reality were at
odds when initially assessing LIS staff skills.  Dan Fogelberg
said it best in his song, <i>The Higher I climb</i> from <i><a href="http://www.in-your-ear.com/">High Country Snows</a></i>:</p>

<blockquote><i>The higher I climb, the more that I see.<br>
The more that I see, the less that I know.<br>
The less that I know, the more that I yearn.<br>
The more that I yearn, the higher I climb.</i></blockquote>

<p>Once training began, the need for more training <span>followed</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span></p>  

<p>Working together and learning new skills built confidence and positive <span>attitudes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>  Increased confidence and positive <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>made further learning possible.  By the end of year one, LIS staff
were requesting further training.  They credited the training programme for making their Web support possible.  <a href="http://www.netskills.ac.uk/">Netskills </a>provided most of the training, and their on-line TONIC package is recommended.  The social element of training together as a group of subject
specialists from different <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>accounted for much of the success.</p>


<h2>Appearances</h2>

<p><b><i>Promotion: </i> </b>Changing the image of the academic libraries from warehouses of books and journals to places of access for print and electronic information was urgent. The LIS professional staff did not market a new image.  One academic gave this <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>when advised to seek help from the LIS staff when searching the Web .  &quot;Why would I go to the library to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>the Web?&quot;  The LIS staff skills in information searching and <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>checking did not seem to translate to this new <span>medium</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span></p>  

<p><a href="#farm">Jane Farmer and Fiona Campbell</a> researched skills used by librarians and by managers.  They reported the managers were significantly more skilled in the following three areas:</p> 

<ol>
<li>Promotion of product</li>
<li>Marketing of product</li>
<li>Oral <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>of information</li>
</ol>

<p>Perhaps the service ethos of the profession led to the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>of awareness raising activity in TAPin LIS.  It may also be related to a low level of confidence in <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>performance and Web searching
skills.  The blurring of computing services and library services may also have kept promotion activity low.  One academic was heard to say that librarians should not be <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>about the Internet to <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>  Whatever the reasons, the need to promote Web mediation and services was needed within the LIS, across campus, and on-line.</p> 

<p><b><i>Signage:  </i></b>The messages conveyed on signs<b> </b>and bulletin boards within the LIS did not <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>the cultural shift from holdings to access.  Directional signs pointed to collections of print material.  Signs also indicated where OPACs or CD-ROMs were located.  Seldom were there signs to terminals dedicated to Web access.  When these were found they were usually set to one URL such as the British Library Web site.  The sign indicated which Web resource was available from that machine.  Terminals for general Web searching were seldom found.  Even the enquiries desks where LIS staff had Web access did not have signs telling patrons that Web mediation was available from the desk.</p>   

<p>Signs were also used to convey policy.  The content of these assumed the user was physically in the library, e.g. opening hours, fines for overdue materials.  Rare was the sign indicating how to access resources <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>the building.  Areas of the LIS where subject specific collections were housed did not have bulletin boards displaying useful Web sites and e-mail addresses for subject support.  Patrons were <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>to find the information in-house or find a member of staff to consult <span>directly</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>  There was little in appearances indicating that surfing the Web was welcomed or even possible from within the LIS.</p>

<p>Remote access to the LIS gave a better image of the Web.  University homepages had <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>to the libraries and learning resource centres.  These LIS pages linked to subject support pages where collections of URLs and e-mail <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>were evident.  These valuable resources were hidden within <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>Web sites.  They remained unsupported by signs and printed publications. </p> 

<p><b><i>Printed guides:  </i></b>The messages conveyed in signs and posted notices were reflected in printed LIS publications.  These guides focused on locating and using in-house holdings or LIS policies.
 Guides for electronic resources were usually specific to <span>CD-ROM</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>titles and assumed the patron was in the LIS.  Information available from the LIS Web site was not <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>print.  Signs
and printed guides promoting Web access may happen in the near <span>future</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>  There was talk about not wanting to build unfulfilled expectations.  Until the IT and staff training were complete and service procedures in place, a high demand for Web access and expertise could <span>prove</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>problematic. </p> 

<h2>Service practices</h2>

<p>The cascade affect of TAPin had not <span>reached</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>the counter staff.  Enquiries about Web access resulted in blank looks and confused messages from various service points e.g., the issue desk.  Presumably, every worker in the LIS knew how printed books and journals were ordered, processed and issued.  With the exception of inter-library loans, they did not have the same understanding about remote resources.  The usual service practice was to <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>the patron to a particular member of staff who &quot;knew about the Web&quot;.  Service practices; regarding accessing the Web from within the LIS, printed and human support for Web access, and addressing remote users, will enevitably change.  Judith <a href="#quil">Quilter</a>, a member of the diglibns discussion <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>made this observation: &quot;Since our webpage has been available our photocoying requests and ILLs by e-mail have increased.  Some of the e-mails have up to 40 requests at a time.&quot;</p>     

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It was easy to identify the changes which have not occurred in the TAPin LIS.  Years of <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span><span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>collections and <span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>services created an inertia which will take more than two years to modify.  The management commitment and staff training did much to change <span>attitudes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>  The campus networks and high <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>PCs are now in place.  These three factors will result in changes in how the Web is presented and <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>at all levels within the LIS.  Should promotional <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>accompany these changes, the Web will play an active role in academic libraries and learning resource centres.  Mediation and support for Web use will provide a value <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:51px 17px 51px 17px;position:relative;">.</span>service.</p>

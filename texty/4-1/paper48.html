<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The information needs of social science researchers can increasingly be met via the Internet.  
Electronic information resources relevant to the social sciences, including data and datasets, are being 
made publicly available world-wide and the Internet offers the potential for researchers to access these from their desktops.  However, the proliferation of resources coupled with a lack of Internet skills leads some researchers into difficulties when attempting to search for - and retrieve - useful 
information.</p>

<p>
The Social Science Information Gateway (SOSIG) was established in 1994 as a pilot project to provide 
fast and easy access to relevant, high quality networked resources for social science researchers, 
academics and librarians.  The gateway provides access to Internet resources via an online catalogue 
where each resource had been classified and described by an information professional.  The SOSIG 
team locate, assess and describe high quality networked resources from around the world, adding value 
and saving time and effort for researchers and users of their research by providing the facility to 
browse and search resource descriptions and connect directly to resources of interest.  The catalogue 
currently contains over 3500 descriptions of resources in over a hundred and sixty subject headings 
ranging from Anthropology to Statistics.
</p>
<p>
Four years is a long time on the Internet and so, for an Internet service SOSIG is very well established. 
But compared to a traditional library catalogue, for example, SOSIG is still very young and we have 
many plans for expansion and enhancement.  Any service and especially any Internet based service 
requires research and development to keep it running effectively.  SOSIG has a policy of continually 
reviewing and improving the service based on user feedback and in response to fast-changing 
technologies and standards developments.  SOSIG's participation in the EU-funded <a href="#des">DESIRE (1998?)</a> 
(Development of a European Service for Information on Research and Education) project has enabled 
the service to concentrate some of its research and development activities in the area of resource 
discovery, as well as provide additional functionality to the service itself.  This paper looks at some of 
the theoretical work that underpins the service and how that impacts on the day to day running of the 
gateway.
</p>
<h2>The Theory</h2>
<p>The EU-funded DESIRE project has provided the opportunity for some crucial research and 
development work to be undertaken in the area of resource discovery.  DESIRE is a major international 
project aiming to build large scale information networks for the research community, examining many 
related issues such as discovery of information, security, caching and training.  The project is 
supported by the European Union's Telematics Application Programme involving 22 partner 
organisations from across Europe.  The strands of work that SOSIG is involved in within DESIRE 
concentrates on issues of cataloguing and indexing information on the Internet and training users to 
make the greatest use of the tools and services produced in the project.  The partners within the 
cataloguing and indexing information strand are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Koninklijke Bibliotheek (National Library of the Netherlands)
<li>Loughborough University
<li>Netlab at the University of Lund in Sweden
<li>SOSIG at the University of Bristol
<li>UKOLN (UK Office for Library and Information Networking) at the University of Bath
</ul>
<p>
The deliverables from this work are currently being consolidated in a single web site to act as a 
dissemination tool for this component of the DESIRE project (<a href="#cat">Cataloguing and indexing. 1998</a>).  
</p>

<h3>Issues of quality </h3>
<p>
Almost anyone can publish on the Internet, and the ease with which even the most inexperienced can 
put material on the Web has led to a proliferation of resources.  The quality of the information 
however, is often indeterminate.  Without publishers, editors, peer-review and other 'filters', much of 
the information is popular in nature as opposed to academic, and much of it may be invalid, inaccurate 
or irrelevant to academics.  
<p>
DESIRE conducted a 'state of the art' review into the development of quality systems and selection 
criteria for subject information gateways (<a href="#hof">Hofman & Worsfold, 1998</a>).  The review covered:
<p>
<ul>
<li>quality definitions and practices used in the commercial sector 
<li>selection criteria currently being used by subject gateways 
<li>selection criteria used by other Internet services 
<li>selection criteria used in libraries
</ul>
<p>
The review fed into the development of a generic list of selection criteria that could be used by services 
and institutions to inform the development of their own set of selection criteria.  This work also led to 
the development of a graphical and textual representation of the quality processes involved within a 
subject information gateway.  The model can be used in the specification, implementation, 
development and evaluation of a gateway.  The list of selection criteria and the quality model are 
currently being revised and the updated versions will be made available from the DESIRE Cataloguing 
and Indexing Web site.
</p>
<h3>Resource description</h3>
<p>There are many lists of Internet sites available, subject gateways are distinguished by the added value 
of detailed descriptions of the content, origin and nature of each site.  This creation of descriptions is 
also known as resource description or metadata.  DESIRE carried out a survey of the current resource 
descriptions formats being used, as well as looking at some of the issues surrounding the description of 
Internet resources (<a href="#dem">Dempsey & Heery, 1998</a>).
<p>
<h3>Classification</h3>
<p>A number of Internet catalogues and services are using traditional library classification schemes to 
organise their information and aid retrieval.  A study of the classification schemes currently in use in 
Internet search and discovery services is available in the DESIRE report  The role of classification 
schemes in Internet resource description and discovery (<a href="#koc">Koch & Day, 1998</a>).  This review of classification schemes 
included universal schemes such as LC (Library of Congress), and UDC (Universal Decimal 
Classification), national schemes such as Nederlandse Basisclassificatie (BC), subject specific schemes 
such as National Library of Medicine (NLM) and home grown schemes.  It also reviewed attempts to 
apply automatic classification of information.  
<p>
<h3>Distributed cataloguing</h3>
<p>
Because of the open nature of the Web there is considerable potential for distributed collaborative 
cataloguing of networked resources.  Information gateways can be built by teams of staff who are 
geographically dispersed but who can add resources to a database from their desktops via the WWW.  
DESIRE looked at and described a number of different strategies for distributed cataloguing .  One 
model with which DESIRE experimented was setting up distributed databases in different countries.  
As part of this work the Koninklijke Bibliotheek have set up an experimental ROADS based subject 
gateway for Dutch Arts and Social Sciences Resources for the purpose of cross searching 
geographically dispersed databases.  A demonstrator has been set up to show the potential of cross 
searching distributed gateways.  The demonstrator allows combined searches of three information 
gateways: SOSIG, Biz/ed (Business Education on the Internet) and the Koninklijke Bibliotheek's 
experimental Arts and Social Sciences gateway.
<p>
<h3>Automated indexing</h3>
<p>
DESIRE is also working on an automated approach to resource discovery which is complementary to 
the quality controlled catalogue approach.  The effort is centred on the creation of a European Web 
Index (EWI) which will provide a search interface to Internet documents published in Europe 
(harvesting not only on-line documents from the Web, but also those available via other Internet 
protocols.  The harvested information will be made available through the Z39.50 protocol.  There has 
also been some work on the integration of robot gathered databases and subject information gateways.
<p>
<h2>The practice</h2>
SOSIG practice has informed much of the more generic theoretical work which we have undertaken in 
DESIRE.  Similarly SOSIG has used the results of the DESIRE research to inform the development of 
the gateway.  Issues discussed above have underpinned SOSIG change and developments in the 
following areas:
<p>
<h3>Issues of quality</h3>
<p>A fundamental distinction between SOSIG and the search engines lies in the way in which they build 
their collections.  SOSIG is selective - it only points to resources that have been vetted for quality by a 
team of information specialists.  The search engines aim to be comprehensive in their coverage and use 
robots to try to automatically index every resource on the Internet, regardless of its content and source.  
SOSIG used the generic quality criteria generated from the DESIRE report to develop a scope policy 
and a set of formal selection criteria for the gateway.  The DESIRE report has also been used to 
develop selection criteria for other information gateways.
<p>
<h3>Resource description</h3>
<p>SOSIG creates metadata for resources that it selects using the pre-defined set of quality criteria.  The service uses a generic metadata format for describing resources using a simple record structure based on attribute-value pairs.  This format is designed to be full enough to support effective user retrieval and selection of resources and is capable of being mapped to a variety of other formats, e.g. the Dublin Core.
<p>
<h3>Classification</h3>
<p>The DESIRE classification report caused SOSIG to review the scheme that was currently in use on the service (an abridged form of the UDC (Universal Decimal Classification) scheme).  The selection of 
UDC numbers used by SOSIG has now been extended to cover a wider selection of social science 
subjects and been used to provide browsable sub sections within the main subject categories.  This will 
allow for more specific browsing and help to manage the increase in the number of resources.
<p>
<h3>Distributed cataloguing</h3>

<p>SOSIG has piloted two approaches to distributed cataloguing (based on investigative work carried out through DESIRE).
<p>
<ol>
<li>Section editors
In May 1997 ten universities across the UK began a one year pilot project as Section Editors for 
SOSIG.  One or more librarians at each institution were appointed to spend half a day per week 
building up the SOSIG collection.  An initial training workshop was held to familiarise the Section 
Editors with the SOSIG selection and cataloguing skills.  An administration centre was also built to 
support remote cataloguing into the SOSIG database using the Web.  The administration centre 
provides access to the template creation and editing tools as well as supporting tools and 
documentation.
<p>
The Section Editors are responsible for the identification, evaluation and cataloguing of resources 
under a particular subject area.  The SOSIG core staff continue to be responsible for the overall 
development of the collection as well as for routine maintenance tasks such as link checking.  The 
input from these subject specialists has done much to increase the depth and breadth of the SOSIG 
collection as well as foster valuable links with the library community.
<p>
<li>Correspondents
A second model for distributed cataloguing was the recruitment of Correspondents to help build up the 
number of catalogued resources from other European countries.  A call for Correspondents was 
requested through articles in key journals and through messages to a number of European mailing lists. 
Correspondents are volunteers who are willing to submit suggestions on a regular basis of resources to 
be added to SOSIG.  Unlike the Section Editors the correspondents do not have direct access to the 
SOSIG database, their suggestions are handled by the SOSIG core staff who create the catalogue 
entries in the database.  A set of tools and guidelines were produced to support the Correspondents.  
This approach has had varied success as it relies on the good will of individuals who are receiving no 
support from their institution for this work.  However it does seem to have improved the profile of 
SOSIG in Europe and we receive many more 'Add a New Resource' suggestions from European 
organisations albeit on a one off basis. 
</ol>
<h3>Automated Indexing</h3>
<p>SOSIG is experimenting with the Combine technology developed by DESIRE to create a companion 
database to the main quality controlled section on SOSIG.  The 'All Social Science' database is 
generated by feeding the harvester with selected URL's from the main SOSIG database, the harvester 
will then index pages found from those URL's generating a large database of (mostly) social science 
material.
<p>

Another complementary approach to increasing the depth of the SOSIG collection is to use automatic 
methods of producing catalogue records, using metadata provided by information providers.  This 
would allow gateways to catalogue to a deeper level within a site or organisation. There is an 
increasing awareness within the Internet community of the importance of providing good metadata to 
aid the discovery and use of their Web documents and information resources.  SOSIG is hoping to  
work with the social science community by harvesting metadata produced by "trusted information 
providers".  This will help to increase awareness of the output of the UK academic and research 
community.
<p>
<h2>Other areas of development</h2>
<p>
There are several other areas of development not directly related to the work on DESIRE that SOSIG is 
currently working on.  
<p>
<h3>Thesaurus</h3>
<p>
SOSIG recently introduced a thesaural tool on the service to help users refine their searches.  The 
thesaurus is based on HASSET (Humanities and Social Science Electronic Thesaurus) which was 
developed by the UK Data Archive at the University of Essex.  We are currently developing a second 
implementation of the thesaurus based on feedback received from our user community.  SOSIG will 
also be collaborating with the Data Archive to expand HASSET into a general tool for the social 
science community.
<p>
<h3>Mirroring</h3>
Recent talks with the US-based InterNIC (who are the creators of the popular Internet review guide - 
The Scout Report) have resulted in an agreement to mirror each others' services, to help to save 
international bandwidth and provide faster access for our users. 
<p> 
<h3>Subject cache</h3>
Caching is intended to reduce the amount of traffic on the Internet whilst also speeding up response 
times for users.  This is achieved by storing copies of popular Internet pages at locations closer to the 
end user.  SOSIG is experimenting with the creation of a subject based cache that would be populated 
by periodically harvesting the non-UK resources in the database.  Some initial work on this has already 
begun.
<p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In an ever changing environment such as the Internet, research and development is critical for the 
continued success of subject gateways in satisfying their users expectations.  SOSIG is working to 
bring together work on the gateway with other initiatives such as caching, mirroring and training to 
build an Internet 'community centre' for social scientists.

<h2> Introduction</h2>

<p> Teacher-librarians work at the intersection of <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and information science, attempting to <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the skills, <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and responsibilities of both <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and librarianship. Adding to this tension, the context in which teacher-librarians work is rapidly changing because of new educational philosophies and <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> as well as the explosion of information made available through the Web (<a href="#lon03">Lonsdale 2003</a>). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>body of research indicates that information and communication technologies, information literacy <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of accountability for learning outcomes have created new challenges for teacher-librarians around the world (<a href="#moo05">Moore 2005</a>; see also, the <a href="http://www.iasl-slo.org/">International Association for School Librarianship</a> Website.</p>

<p>The ability to adjust individual practice in the midst of reform is an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>skill for <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>professionals. Teacher-librarians work in an <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that will inevitably undergo periods of organizational and pedagogical transformation. Most reform efforts in the United States <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>on classroom teachers, marginalizing or eliminating &ldquo;specialists&rdquo; and programmes that do not articulate their <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to student achievement (<a href="#har01">Hartzell 2001</a>). <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> teacher-librarians are often physically isolated from colleagues who share similar job descriptions, <span>limiting</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>their ability to collaboratively diagnose tensions, <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to new priorities and models of governance and <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>new practice models. </p>

<p>One of the challenges that continues to plague practitioners and researchers is the application of theory to the practice of librarians in the field. Teacher-librarians need additional <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that will permit them to assess their own practice by identifying areas of strength and diagnosing areas of weakness and trouble, <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>into account the wider <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>context. In a recent issue of <em>School Libraries Worldwide</em> focused on evidence-based practice, Todd (<a href="#tod06">2006</a>) called for an integrated approach to the research of <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>librarianship, <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>beyond advocacy to the development of effective, reflective library programmes. This paper proposes an activity-theoretical approach for examining <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>library <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> which integrates research evidence, professional expertise and reflective decision making. </p>

<p>The Small High School Libraries Project involves a group of six geographically dispersed teacher-librarians in the greater Seattle, Washington (USA) area whose <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>are in the midst of structural and pedagogical reform. The goals of the project included: developing an understanding of the issues faced by teacher-librarians during the reform process; assisting the teacher-librarians in aligning their practice with the information needs of a changing school; and identifying best <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>for supporting positive adaptation during this process. </p>

<p>Early in the project, the research team looked for <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>with which to analyse a <span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>body of <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>data to develop an understanding of the teacher-librarians&rsquo; professional world from multiple viewpoints. Developmental Work Research emerged as a viable approach. To the team&rsquo;s knowledge, this <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>has not been applied to <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>librarianship. It has, however, found numerous <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in health care, <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>practice (<a href="#eng91">Engestr&ouml;m 1991</a>; <a href="#eng02">Engestr&ouml;m <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>; <a href="#mie99">Miettinen, 1999</a>). In Developmental Work Research, <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>are analysed as socially distributed collective activities which evolve over time through tension, contradiction and innovation. New models of practice emerge from the research participants&rsquo; experience, similar to the <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>research models of organizational learning (<a href="#arg96">Argyris &amp; Schon 1996</a>).

<h3> Background: the <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/5NhhGipYm" target="_blank">Small High School Libraries Project</a></h3>

<p> The Small High School Libraries Project is a three-year <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>school libraries in the midst of a specific structural and curricular reform effort. Through this reform, comprehensive high <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>(grades 9-12) of 800-2000 <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>are being subdivided into autonomous academies or &ldquo;small schools&rdquo; of 400 <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>or fewer. Small <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>purportedly provide an improved learning <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that results in increased academic achievement, lowered dropout rates and improved parent, teacher and student satisfaction with schooling. The small <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>approach has the support of the United States Congress, the Department of Education and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Changing the size and nature of high <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>also <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>a change in the library services of those <span>schools</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

Teaching and learning in a small <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>requires that the library and librarian provide a rich infrastructure of information skills instruction and services, <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and literacy advocacy, information and technology services and resources management. </p>

<h3> Methodology: Activity Theory and Developmental Work Research </h3>

<p>Activity theory originated within the cultural-historical tradition of Soviet <span>psychology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and its development is credited largely to Alexei N. Leont&rsquo;ev (<a href="#leo79">1979</a> <a href="#leo81">1981</a>). It is concerned with the process of mediation: how <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>activity shapes and is shaped by <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>functioning. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>international <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>has developed around this theory and excellent <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of its  intellectual origins are available in the work of several scholarly domains, including <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#eng99">Engestr&ouml;m 1999</a>), cultural <span>psychology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#rat06">Ratner 2006</a>), human-computer <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#kap06">Kaptelinin &amp; Nardi 2006</a>; <a href="#kuu96">Kuutti 1996</a>) and information science (<a href="#wil06">Wilson 2006</a>). Within library and information science the theory is gaining significant <span>attention</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> having been applied to subject <span>representation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#hjo97">Hj&oslash;rland 1997</a>), digital library evaluation (<a href="#spa02">Spasser 2002</a>) and information seeking (<a href="#wil06">Wilson 2006</a>). The particular interpretation of activity theory used in this paper, Cultural Historical Activity Theory, is grounded in the work of Yrj&ouml; Engestr&ouml;m and his Developmental Work Research programme at the University of Helsinki. The following paragraphs describe three key concepts of this research approach: the activity system, contradictions and expansive learning.</p>

<h3> The socially distributed activity system</h3>

<p> Cultural-historical activity theory addresses human activities as they relate to artefacts, shared <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and institutions, thus it goes beyond individual knowledge and decision making to take a developmental view of <span>minds</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in context. As people work, play, think and <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>problems together they demonstrate an accumulated set of habits and <span>values</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Learning is not an isolated act; rather it is situated in time and space and <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>by the surrounding actors, resources and behavioural constraints. One should also recognize that agents in the learning process, through their activities, influence the <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in which such learning takes place. Cultural-historical activity theory, then, as a dynamic model, is particularly appropriate for the study of educational practice. </p>

<p> In Developmental Work Research, which draws on the mediational theories of Leont&rsquo;ev (<a href="#leo78">1978</a>) and Vygotsky (<a href="#vyg78">1978</a>), the socially distributed activity system is the fundamental unit of analysis. Activity becomes the least meaningful context for understanding individual actions, but at a higher level it can be used to describe and evaluate systemic <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and relationships. In this approach, the activity system is composed of '<em>the individual practitioner, the colleagues and co-workers of the workplace <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> the conceptual and <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>tools and the shared objects as a unified dynamic whole</em>' (<a href="#eng91">Engestr&ouml;m, 1991</a>: 267). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>model of this system appears in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>1. The systemic view of activity posits that each element is related to all other elements dialectically; that is, they are <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>yet interdependent (<a href="#rat02">Ratner 2002</a>; <a href="#rat06">2006</a>). The activity system, composed of the actor (subject) and his mediating <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>(rules, <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> division of labour), is defined by the object, or objective, of the activity. The object-oriented nature of activity is what gives it <span>direction</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> as well as what distinguishes it from other activities. The object should correspond to the motive that <span>drives</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the system and the interrelationship of its elements.</p>

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 1: model of the socially distributed activity system.</strong></div>

<p> The system has embedded in it different viewpoints, historically conditioned <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and rules of behaviour and artefacts that constrain and afford activity. It is useful for making sense of everyday practice as well as disturbances and changes in the work <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Tensions may exist within and among the different elements of the system. These tensions and how they are resolved (or aggravated) provide continuous <span>transformations</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> the development of new <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p> Much of the power of activity theory as an <span>explanatory</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>rests in the concept of <em>contradictions</em> (<a href="#eng99">Engestr&ouml;m 1999</a>). Contradictions <span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>when new ways of thinking or doing come in <span>conflict</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>with traditional or currently <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>ways of thinking and doing and may <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>within each of the elements, between elements, or among activities, resulting in tensions within the system. Exaggerated contradictions, or those which reach crisis proportions, may result in a breakdown of the activity system itself. Very often, in the course of everyday activities, tensions or breakdowns in activity will be repaired or negotiated, but not all tensions or contradictions are obvious to the actors engaged in a given activity. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> actors may not share consistent motivations or conceptions, despite their participation in the same activity (<a href="#bla95">Blackler 1995</a>). </p>

<h3> The expansive learning cycle</h3>

<p> Engestr&ouml;m (<a href="#eng87">1987</a> <a href="#eng91">1991</a>) describes the practice, which he calls <em>expansive learning</em>, of using contradictions to serve as a <em>springboard</em> for changing activity <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Rather than seeing contradictions as adverse <span>consequences</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> they provide a potential driving <span>force</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>for innovation and improvement of <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and services. This is not na&iuml;ve, unscientific <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>research, but a model of intervention based in a careful analysis of <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>activity, with an historical analysis illuminating the origins of these conditioned <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p> Activity <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>do not re0e in a vacuum; rather, they are constantly <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>by the conditions in which they re0e, including other related activity <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and the persons who engage in the activities themselves. The system is continually striving for <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>while encountering tension and contradiction, hence it is a learning cycle not unlike Vygotsky&rsquo;s (<a href="#vyg78">1978</a>) Zone of Proximal <span>Development</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>(ZPD). The 'more capable peer', in the case of the Small High School Libraries project, is the research team itself, which is seeking to stimulate innovation and change in each of the six study <span>schools</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> By working closely with the teacher-librarians, both as individuals and as a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of practice, we are engaged in the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of contextually-situated best <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that may be applied and adapted to other <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>facing similar change.</p>

<p> <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>2 illustrates the expansive learning cycle employed by the research team. The team, in the first fourteen months,was engaged deeply in the first two steps in the cycle, during which time interviews and observations, what we have called the <em>ethnography of trouble</em>, have helped us identify a number of contradictions and tensions. Combined with historical analysis of the reform process, both locally and on a broader plane, these <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>studies have helped us develop <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to influence library activity, specifically targeting the aspects of reform present in each <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>while supporting the existing <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of the librarians that appear to work well. The librarians involved in the study have been instrumental in helping the team <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and modify the proposed models of practice (Step 3). Implementation of these new models is occurring in all six sites, with analysis of the effects to follow in the coming year.</p>

<div align="center"><br />Figure 2: Expansive learning cycle (adapted from <a href="#eng91">Engestr&ouml;m 1991</a>)</div>

<p> The nature of this model of research is inherently interventionist. The project team, however, does not impose its new models on the research context; rather it stimulates implementation of new <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> These <em>given</em> <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>will be adapted by the activity system as they come into <span>conflict</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>with existing practice, creating a new and critically, socially constructed practice.

<p> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>triangulated, <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>approach was used to develop a comprehensive <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of the work life of librarians, the libraries they worked in and their place in the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>community (<a href="#pat02">Patton 2002</a>: 306). The data presented herein are <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>from interviews with administrators, librarians and classroom teachers, corroborated by over 100 hours spent observing the same librarians and classroom teachers as well as individual <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and full <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>engaged in activities within their high <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>libraries. The data were collected over a twenty-four month <span>period</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> overlapping two academic years. The field sites are six <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>libraries in the greater Seattle, Washington area (USA), representing a diverse <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of student and <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>demographics. </p>

<p> In-depth interviews with each teacher-librarian once a year (a total of eighteen interviews), administrators (eighteen  interviews) and classroom teachers (fifty-seven interviews) were necessary to understand the different perspectives on library activity. We balanced these perspectives with <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>observations (two to three hours each, forty-two in total), performed at different times of <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and different days of the week to permit study of a wide <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of both student and adult activities. Collaborative interviews were <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to get the <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of both classroom teachers and teacher-librarians on the same library activity. These occurred within two days of an observation and included questions concerning: their use of library resources; collaboration activities with the teacher-librarian; and their <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of the role of the teacher-librarian and of the library in the <span>school</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>s curriculum. In addition to these <span>formally</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>scheduled data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>activities, the research team regularly communicated with teacher-librarians by e-mail and in <span>person</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p> The data collected through these methods were analysed iteratively by the research team, combined with an historical analysis of <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>reform and the individual research sites. The historical <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>included a review of the local context and of the broader field of <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>libraries and educational reform. Case studies of each <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>were constructed, along with axial coding of themes among different data sources to <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>trends across all six <span>schools</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p> The cultural-historical activity theory <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>can be used to make sense of both everyday and ongoing situations, disturbances and innovations in library practice. But beyond understanding the why and how of existing <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>library practice is the question of how we change and improve the work practitioners do in serving the needs of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and teachers. In the case of <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>engaged in reform practice, that question becomes: How do <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>libraries adapt to evolving educational policies and <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>at the <span>school</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> district or even national level?

<p> Learning in the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>library is not simply a matter of individual <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>acquiring knowledge of specific domains, but is, rather, the development of specific cultural <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that rely on the rules, <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>present in the learning context. The nature of <em>knowing</em> in the socio-cultural sense is collective, situated and tentative (<a href="#col93">Cole &amp; Engestr&ouml;m 1993</a>). While all activity-theoretic <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>concur with this <span>epistemological</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>stance, there are two ways in which cultural-historical activity theory has been applied to learning domains (<a href="#bla95">Blackler 1995</a>). These <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>are different, but not incompatible with the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>tenets of Leont&rsquo;ev's theoretical concepts (<a href="#zin95">Zinchenko 1995</a>). The first of these focuses on how individuals develop common understanding of their practice through participation in shared activities (e.g., <a href="#hak99">Hakkarainen 1999</a>; <a href="#lee03">Lee 2003</a>). The second focuses on how group activity is conceived and is subsequently conditioned by the social, material and intellectual resources to which they have access (e.g., <a href="#bel96">Bellamy 1996</a>; <a href="#eng02">Engestr&ouml;m <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>; <a href="#mie99">Miettinen 1999</a>).

<h3> General model of teacher-librarian activity</h3>

<p> The situated nature of activity <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>indicates that they are rooted in historically developed and conditioned <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> The position of the teacher-librarian within the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and the role of the library  in learning is also a historical construction with <span>inherent</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>contradictions. While the literature of <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>librarianship abounds with idealized role suggestions, such as collaborator, instructional consultant, change agent, to name a few, it is the rare teacher-librarian who is been capable of translating these conceptual buzzwords into <span>action</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> The <em>Information Power</em> guidelines and <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>revision, <em>Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning</em> (<a href="#aas98">AASL/AECT 1998</a>), lay out the numerous and sometimes conflicting responsibilities of the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>library professional. Even when teacher-lirarians are able to negotiate among these different <span>roles</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> teachers, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and administrators may have very different <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#har02">Hartzell 2002</a>; <a href="#mcc01">McCracken 2001</a>; <a href="#mey06">Meyers <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>; <a href="#nak00">Nakamura 2000</a>; <a href="#new04">Newell 2004</a>). Thus, there exist contradictions between theory and practice in the work of teacher-librarians.</p>

<p> Early in the analysis of <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>data, there emerged contradictions between how teacher-librarians described their practice and their <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>behaviour. Further, a number of tensions were apparent, some as a result of <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>re-organization, others that had been present, latently, for years before the reform effort. The research team identified common themes; each of which was present to a different extent in the six participating sites: </p>

<ul>
  <li> Teacher-librarians often had a difficult time articulating how the library contributed to student learning or aligned with the broader <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>mission of the <span>school</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Many of their priorities and motivations were based in affective needs or responses to immediate problems or  &ldquo;fighting fires.&rdquo; Librarians were neither thinking nor acting strategically. None had short-term or long-term goals for his/her programmes or facilities. </li>
  <li> Teacher-librarians felt isolated from other librarians and misunderstood by teachers and administrators. They were not using their position in the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to enhance pedagogy or promote the mission of the library. Most did not display the attributes of <span>influential</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>practitioners or leaders. </li>
  <li> Teachers and administrators had a poor grasp of the <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>teacher-librarians played in the <span>school</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> They focused predominantly on the provision of resources rather than learning outcomes. Mis-communication between the teacher-librarian and classroom teachers <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>regularly.</li>
  <li> The <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to which teacher-librarians felt they were in <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of the library programme dictated the extent to which they felt <span>influential</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>within the building. Teacher-librarians often felt victimized and powerless to change their <span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> even when they recognized the need for new <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> </li>
</ul>

<p>Drawing on these themes and the emerging portraits of practice, the research team formulated a general model of library activity based on the activity system in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>1. This model with its contradictions (Figure 3) is a synthesis of the activities apparent in all six research sites. Using this general model as a base, the research team would construct models of individual practice for each site, focusing on the challenges most salient in each context. </p>

<p>An important <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>contradiction, which was either latent or salient in each of the library programmes, was located between the object and the <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of the teacher-librarian's activity system. Much of the conversation  around library practice was focused on the <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of research, so much so that it <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to be the motivation behind much of the work. They also <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to struggle with concepts of identity, a contradiction between subject and division of labour. Rather than focusing on student learning, teacher-librarians were serving as gatekeepers to collections of resources. Both of these contradictions contributed toward ambiguity of the object: was the motivation behind librarianship student learning and <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>achievement, or the <span>mechanics</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>information?</p>

<h3>The intervention: collabouratively designing <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of expansion</h3>

<p> Conversations with the teacher-librarians during initial data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>(Spring 2005) led the research team to think that a collaborative support structure might assist them in successfully adapting to their changing <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> The conceptual work of Etienne Wenger, specifically his discussion of designing a <em>learning architecture</em> to support a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of practice (Wenger 1998) also served as a guide at this stage. We planned and arranged a formal meeting of the six participating teacher-librarians, four members of the research team and an expert in <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>reform from a nearby <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>district. This successful initial meeting has since evolved into a series of six day-long workshops (at approximately three month intervals) which we call Research Conversations. </p>

<p>At <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>workshops, armed with a deeper understanding of the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>contexts and existing <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> the research team set about defining learning goals with the teacher-librarians. Through the course of interviews and these formal meetings, the following set of goals emerged as priorities for our practitioners: </p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Self knowledge:</strong> teacher-librarians gaining a better understanding of their own practice and identity.</li>
  <li><strong>Contextual knowledge:</strong> teacher-librarians acquiring a deeper sense of their <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and the key stakeholders in their programmes. </li>
  <li><strong>Inspiring practice:</strong> giving teacher-librarians the opportunity to see different <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of the library mission through sharing, discussion and presentations. </li>
  <li><strong>Aligning practice:</strong> adjusting the mission of the teacher-librarian and library to align with the needs of the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>community. </li>
  <li><strong>Communicating mission and identity:</strong> projecting the new mission and implementing complementary <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>community. </li>
</ul>

<p>The Research Conversations have become an opportunity for the teacher-librarians to <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>ideas about practice, as well as <span>observe</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>different <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of their work. It serves as a venue for <em>externalization </em>of disturbances in an atmosphere of open discussion. The research team guides a portion of the agenda to ensure consistency, but much of the work accomplished is driven by the challenges faced by the teacher-librarians in context. </p>

<p>The means to achieving the goals jointly constructed through these meetings has taken the form of a series of expansive <span>instruments</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> created by the research team and presented to the teacher-librarians at the Research Conversations. In some cases, the <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>are reflective activities performed as individuals, but some are research activities <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to promote evidence-based practice. In all cases, the <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>are <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to present practice as problematical, suggesting areas of improvement or re-alignment. Not all of the teacher-librarians have engaged fully with all the <span>instruments</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> The research team guides their use of the <span>instruments</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> but the extent to which they change the <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and behaviour of the teacher-librarians is individual. The Zone of Proximal <span>Development</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> that is the difference between the real and potential state of their practice, is different for each practitioner and the depth of <em>internalization</em> varies by the extent to which these <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>enable them to <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>their work as problematical.</p>

<p>While it is <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the scope of this paper to give a thorough accounting of these <span>instruments</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> their <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and implementation, a brief summary provides the key concepts and perceived benefits of each. </p>

<p><strong>Reflective interviews:</strong> teacher-librarians were engaged in semi-structured interviews which asked them to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>on their programme priorities and daily activities. They enjoyed these conversations about their practice and most interviews lasted well beyond the <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>protocol <span>length</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of thirty to forty-five minutes. </p>

<p><strong>Support circles:</strong> during the interview, teacher-librarians completed a <span>circle</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>diagram based on Hartzell&rsquo;s (<a href="#har94">1994</a>) Power/Dependency Mapping with an interview protocol based in the Perceived <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>Network Inventory, drawing on the concept of &ldquo;reciprocality of support&rdquo; (<a href="#ori85">Oritt <em>et al.</em> 1985</a>). The protocol asked teacher-librarians to identify who they support and who in turn supports their work, creating a <span>visual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>structure (for an example, see <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>4).

<p><strong>&ldquo;What if?&rdquo; scenarios:</strong> during the <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>research conversation, teacher-librarians were asked to imagine what would happen if the library and librarian were to be removed and, specifically, what the impact would be on five different <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Responses were shared among the group and discussed. This activity asked them critically to assess the impact of their programmes. </p>

<p><strong>Time management survey:</strong> teacher-librarians were asked to track their daily activities in fifteen-minute intervals for an entire <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>once a week for five weeks (in total, five days of data from each participant). The <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>were shared at the fifth Research Conversation. One teacher-librarian created a form for sharing perceived and real time data with administrators. This data was used to analyse perceived role selections compared and contrasted with activity logs. </p>

<p><strong>Student surveys:</strong> each <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>was provided with a Personal Response System (PRS), which consists of <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>hardware</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>for gathering real-time <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>data from <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> With the help of the teacher-librarians, the research team constructed a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>instrument to be administered with the device to all ninth- and twelfth-grade <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Questions focused on student information behaviour and <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of library and information services. These surveys provided an engaging point of <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>between teacher-librarians and <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and provided a foundation for evidence-based practice. </p>

<p><strong>Advisory boards:</strong> teacher-librarians were encouraged to form advisory boards for their library programmes, consisting of teacher leaders and administrators. Advisory boards would provide localized feedback on services and help align the library mission with <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>goals. The research team provided guidance and support for the formation of these boards. </p>

<p><strong>Ten-week reports:</strong> teacher-librarians were encouraged to provide <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>reports to faculty and staff concerning library activities, including circulation statistics and materials acquisitions. These reports would serve as a means of communicating the library mission and reinforcing its identity as a contributor to student learning. The researchers provided a template and encouragement; teacher-librarians shared their reports with each other to provide inspiration. </p>

<p>It should be noted that not all of these <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>have been successful or universally applied. For example, only two teacher-librarians have <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>advisory boards. On the other hand, all the teacher-librarians utilized the student surveys and reflective activities. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>thread which the research team has tried to pull through all of these <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>is the concept of student learning as the object of library activity, focusing efforts on strategic actions that contribute to the educational mission of the <span>school</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Some of these <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>may be <em>uncomfortable</em> for individual teacher-librarians; furthermore, the benefits of changing practice may not be visible in the short <span>term</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Working at the edge of the practitioner's comfort and competence is consistent with the principles of the Zone of Proximal <span>Development</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>Feedback on the Research Conversations, however, has been overwhelmingly positive. The research team has expanded the format of these workshops to facilitate greater ownership of the agenda and <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>content by the teacher-librarians themselves. Three of the six have chosen to work together on professional development <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the auspices of the research project. This would <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the potential for replicability or sustainability of this model beyond the duration of the grant funding. </p>

<p>The paper thus far has presented a more general view of the challenges facing teacher-librarians it the reform context, as well as how the research team has helped foster opportunities for <span>expansion</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>with these practitioners. In the following section, a case example of one of the six participating high <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>is presented, which illustrates exaggerated contradictions that have put the fate of the library programme in jeopardy and indicates which <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>expansion</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>we hope will alter the fate of this practitioner.</p>

<h3> Case example: Redwood High School</h3>

<p> Ms. Reed (all place <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and identities in the case example are pseudonymous) has been the librarian at Redwood High School for 15 years and has witnessed significant changes in <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning since the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>joined the <a href="http://www.essentialschools.org/" target="_blank">Coalition of Essential Schools</a>. Redwood is gradually converting grade levels into <span>academy</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>groups, which are using team <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>methods, integrated curriculum and a block schedule to facilitate a more personalized learning <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> As this process has progressed, she has noticed changes in the way the library is used, as well as teacher <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>toward the research process.</p>

<h4> Ethnography of trouble</h4>

<p>In nearly twenty hours of observation in the Redwood library, the researchers recorded only two class visits. During the remaining time the library was used by a small number of drop-in <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>or by no one at all. Ms. Reed linked this change in the frequency of library use to the formation of the <span>academy</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>structure in the school:</p>

<blockquote>It started a few years ago when the small <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>programme was really getting under way and the tenth-grade <span>academy</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>was just starting. There was a large drop in the number of teachers bringing in their <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to work on reports here [the library] and dig through the references, the books, go through it all, talk about citations, the whole little quick <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>thing.</blockquote>

<p> One of the pedagogical techniques being used by the teachers during this transition was the development of <em>focus folders</em>, photocopied articles that were pre-selected by the teachers to frame classroom discussion. This <span>technique</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>had become embedded in the <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and its curriculum. Ms. Reed further explained: '<em>The whole curriculum is geared towards the teachers doing the <span>units</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> getting together and doing the research for them [the students] and then passing out the articles to the <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></em>' The <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>by the classroom teachers had moved from the discovery of information through the research process to the analysis and synthesis of information from previously vetted sources. This was confirmed by our interviews with classroom teachers, one of whom remarked, '<em>We don't have a lot of visits to the library.</em>' This teacher's discussion of the collabourative activities with the librarian illustrates this transformation:</p>

<blockquote>Another way that we have worked together in the past is when we did an integrative project for tenth grade; this is a couple of years ago now, on globalization. We needed some background readings on different <span>sorts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of subjects and the teacher-lirarian did the research for us and put together packets so that was really helpful in terms of the project that we did.</blockquote>

<p>The classroom teachers interviewed at Redwood High (n=12) remarked that Ms. Reed is an excellent researcher, capable of <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the most <span>obscure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>information on request. One teacher went so far as to say &lsquo;<em>her talents are wasted at the high <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>level</em>&rsquo; and that she would be better suited to a post-secondary <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>library position. Her own strength as a researcher has prompted Ms. Reed to see research as the <em>object</em> of student learning, rather than the means or <em>instrument</em> of the learning process, disconnecting her from the motivations of the faculty. One veteran teacher remarked that the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>seems to have moved forward pedagogically during the reform process while &lsquo;<em>the library has been left behind</em>&rsquo;.</p>

<p> Ms. Reed has also chosen to <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>role in the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of technology coordinator. In this capacity, she administers and diagnoses problems with the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and communication <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in the <span>school</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> including teacher e-mail. Because these tasks often <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>her to leave the library, she discourages the teachers from sending down large groups of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to use the space and resources when she cannot be present to help them. The <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to a different <span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of research and library usage has been reinforced by the librarian assuming this new role. The <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of library usage is distressing to Ms. Reed, but she does not know how to alter the practice. &lsquo;<em>They used to have to come four or five times a semester but now the teachers just hand them the articles, which I have a hard time with, but that is what they do.</em>&rsquo; <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>principal confided that she is disappointed with the current level of library use and suggested that the librarian exacerbates this trend. In her analysis, the librarian &lsquo;<em>drives people to rely on online materials&rsquo;.</em> She commented further that, &lsquo; <em>It is a huge space and not well used. We do not have the foot traffic we need to have in that space. I have a problem with that</em>&rsquo;. She is <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to look at plans for utilizing the library space with other faculty, but not the teacher-librarian.</p>

<h4> Analysis of contradictions</h4>

<p>At Redwood High School we have significantly different views of the research process, particularly what <span>constitutes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>research and how <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>should be interacting with information. Ms. Reed enjoys the <em>messy</em> aspects of research and feels that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>gain a great <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>from the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>information. '<em>Students may find something you don't like, but that's good; it's an important part of the research process'.</em> The teachers, on the other hand, view research as a means of analysing and synthesizing data. While they rely on background information for their investigations, they see searching as a process that impedes or delays other processes. As a result, the library is sorely underutilized and its <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>as an institution in the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>is in danger. Role adjustments have aggravated this contradiction nearly to the point of break down.</p>

<div align="center"><img width="602" height="181" src="p313fig5.gif" alt="<span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>5: Lack of common object" /></div>
<div align="center"> <br /><strong>Figure 5: Lack of common object creates <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>activity <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></strong> </div>

<p> The library activity system and the teacher activity system do not have a common objective; that is, they have contradictory <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of the student outcome. This is what Hakkarainen (1999) calls the '<em>common object problem'.</em> (Figure 5). The teachers have rejected the library activity system and it does not contribute to student learning. The double bind of under-utilization and associated role change have reinforced the opposing activity system, making change less likely to affect a return to the teacher-librarian's construction of the object: research as the process of tool <span>selection</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and relevance evaluation. This is an example of a tertiary contradiction: the teachers <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>their approach to pedagogy to be more <span>advanced</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> making the earlier model of information seeking espoused by the teacher-librarian obsolete.</p>

<h4> Opportunities for Expansive Learning</h4>

<p> When such a significant difference in meaning <span>occurs</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> intervention will be necessary to <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>closer together. Change on the part of the library programme may not be <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to influence the teacher's activity system. For the system to return to <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and a common object to take <span>hold</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in practice, the teachers and teacher-librarian will need to develop a new way of conceiving research by viewing these processes as complementary, rather than contradictory.  Communication will be <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to eliminating the contradictory <span>positions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and returning the system to <span>balance</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p> The project team has focused individual work with Ms. Reed on two of the <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>expansion</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> specifically the student <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and on improving communication <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>with the faculty through ten-week reports. The student <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>presented an opportunity for Ms. Reed to create <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>with <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and faculty, as well as to create a boundary object, the student responses, which would form the foundation for collaborative information literacy instruction. By gathering and presenting evidence of <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> information behaviour to the faculty, Ms. Reed could encourage conversation about issues that affected classroom work, such as the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> use of convenient rather than authoritative sources. By providing the Personal Response System <span>hardware</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to the Redwood Library, we hoped to encourage evidence-based practice and facilitate formative assessment techniques, both of which are recognized as pedagogically progressive. Ten-week reports would further serve to open a <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of communication with the faculty and <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the library's visibility.</p>

<p> Thus far we have seen some encouraging progress at Redwood High. The ninth-grade world history teachers are working with Ms. Reed, who is facilitating training on the <span>school</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>s online resource collections. There has been a modest increase in the number of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>using the library space, although it is still under-utilised. The student <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>is complete and the results are due to be shared with the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>community in the coming months. In the process of assisting with these <span>instruments</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> new areas of improvement have emerged. The research team has already discussed possible interventions that will improve the relationship with <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>namely</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>making the physical library space more welcoming. </p>

<h2> Discussion: using cultural-historical activity theory to enact new library practices</h2>

<p> Cultural-historical activity theory is above all a model of change, one that holds the potential to drive innovation in practice. Identifying contradictions is the diagnostic facet. To learn and grow, these diagnoses must be acted upon in context to form new <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and ways of looking at the world. The <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>case presented above illustrates the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of this process of designing and implementing new practice to improve student learning through the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>library. We intend to document the changes in these programmes as the <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>take root and evolve; however, the time frame for educational change is often <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in years rather than months or days. One of the limitations of Developmental Work Research is its reliance on practitioners recognizing the need to incorporate new work <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> This is also a key strength of the approach, the adoption of new practice is mutually constructed and collegial and the solution is the one which <span>produces</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the greatest, longest-lasting benefit.</p>

<p> The research team has already seen evidence of changing <span>attitudes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> if not behaviour, among the teacher-librarians in the study. During our <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>contact with these practitioners they offer their insights and feedback to the project team, both by e-mail and in <span>person</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> All have commented, either <span>formally</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>or informally, that their involvement in the research has made them more thoughtful, intentional or reflective about their practice. The following insight came from one of our teacher-librarians in the course of an interview in Autumn 2006:</p>

<blockquote>
Something that I have thought a lot about since the involvement with the grant: it seems to me that back in the really, really, really, old days that the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>relationship that the librarian had was with the things. Like you know, you had to make sure that the things were right, that the books were on the shelf, that the card catalogue was in order, that kind of stuff. And then it seemed that the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>relationship was with the patrons, helping the patrons on an individual basis. But now I'm starting to see the key relationship is between the librarian and the teacher. And the more I think about it the more it makes sense to me, because the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>relationship in the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>is between the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and their teacher in the classroom. And to think [in the past] that the class could come in for an hour and that I would be able to supersede that relationship, even though my role is teacher-librarian... I think that working with the grant has helped me with that evolution of thought.
</blockquote>

<p> This teacher-librarian would appear to be grappling with the strategic nature of her work, specifically which activities and relationships within the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>permit her to have the greatest impact on learning. She has come to understand that the <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>time she has to perform <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>instruction to <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>is ineffective without the integrated support of classroom educators. She illustrates an evolution in conceiving of library work, from the system-centred to the user-centred, then to the higher plane of working to coordinate her activities with the learning outcomes of her fellow educators. Conceptually, she is realigning the object of her practice.</p>

<h3> Implications for <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>study</h3>

<p> This paper does not <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that the <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>designed in these reform <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>are generalisable to all <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>library programmes. Rather, what we hope to reproduce is the method by which the <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>were <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>through analysis and peer collabouration. The next step in our project will be the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of an activity theory toolkit for use by teacher-librarians, disseminated through workshops and facilitated by the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of practice model of professional development (<a href="#wen98">Wenger 1998</a>). Our research team has found that the development of communities of practice, bringing teacher-librarians together virtually and physically, to work on designing new ways of conceiving and delivering information services in their <span>schools</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> contributes significantly to changing the conversation on effective library programmes.</p>

<p> An activity theory toolkit is not a new concept; rather, it draws on the pioneering work of <span>Michael</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>Cole at the Labouratory of Comparative <span>Human</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><span>Cognition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#col96">Cole 1996</a>; <a href="#bro02">Brown &amp; Cole 2002</a>). In designing his <span>Fifth</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>Dimension programme, Cole and his research team use cultural-historical activity theory as a guiding principle of their investigations and intervention programmes targeting at-risk youth. Extending this toolkit concept to library practitioners would empower them to examine and improve their own <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>through a <span>rigorous</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> science-based, <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>research agenda situated in the socio-cultural <span>perspective</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Two potential benefits to such a toolkit appear obvious:  it <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the opportunity to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>a <em>lingua franca</em> for researchers and practitioners in library-based learning; and it should elevate the conversation on library <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to incorporate the macro-cultural factors of the broader learning enterprise. </p>

<p> The activity-theoretic approach opens new possibilities for the study of library programmes, youth information behaviour and student learning as situated activity that is rooted in cultural practice. Beyond descriptive research, cultural-historical activity theory can be used to model and <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>new <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to changing educational needs and constraints. The <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of multiple dimensions of library processes in the concept of an activity system moves away from <span>abstraction</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and isolation and moves toward the prospect of directing change to facilitate more productive <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and greater achievement.</p>

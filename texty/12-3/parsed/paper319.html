<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Perceptions of the reliability and trustworthiness of information may significantly affect the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and use of information sources. In particular, the <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of these criteria is <span>emphasized</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>when information seekers encounter conflicting information. In these situations, they have to assess the credibility and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority of alternative sources. Unfortunately, these questions have so far remained largely un-researched in the context of everyday life information seeking. However, the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is significant, given the fact that an increasing number of alternative sources is <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for people's <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in the daily information <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The present article reports the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of a case study focusing on the information seeking <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of environmental activists. More specifically, the study concentrates on seeking orienting information. By 'orienting information' we mean <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and expressive elements that people employ to monitor everyday events or keep abreast of time. The present study focuses on orienting information about daily events through the media, particularly events related to environmental issues.  The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>research task is to shed light upon the ways in which people assess media credibility and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority in cases when they encounter conflicting information and make decisions to use or ignore such information.</p>

The <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>part of the <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is given background by a review of the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of earlier studies on media credibility and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority in non-work <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Next, the <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>research <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the study is specified.

<h2>Literature review</h2>

<p>Everyday life information seeking studies have identified a number of criteria by which people select information sources in non-work <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> For example, Chen and Hernon (<a href="#che82">1982</a>: 56) showed that in the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of information sources people <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>draw on criteria such as past experience gained from the use of a <span>source</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> easy accessibility and usability. Chatman (<a href="#cha91">1991</a>) drawing largely on Patrick Wilson's (<a href="#wil83">1983 </a>) ideas of <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority found that low-skilled workers placed greatest faith in human sources available in their immediate social milieu. Information originating <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of this <em>small world</em> was not of great interest to them and was not perceived to be as sufficiently authoritative or credible. Hence, they favoured <em>first-level information</em> originating from first-hand experience or hearsay from someone living in the same small world. By contrast, the value of <em>second-level information</em> received from out0ers was mistrusted and often ignored because this type information was not compatible with the common-sense reality of the small world.</p>

<p>Empirical studies such as these have not, however, reviewed media credibility and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority as factors that determine the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and use of information sources. Media credibility and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority denote closely related concepts that are difficult to define unambiguously. This is partly because they overlap with a number of closely related concepts like <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of information, believability of media, and reliability and trustworthiness of information (cf. <a href="#fog99">Fogg and Tseng 1999</a>:  80-81). The conceptual <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is further <span>complicated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by the fact that information scientists and communication researchers use different <span>terminology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to refer to the above issues. Information scientists tend to favour the concept of <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority, while communication researchers prefer concepts such as source-, message-, medium- and media credibility (<a href="#met03">Metzger <i>et al</i>. 2003</a>).</p>

<p>The preference for the concept of <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority among information scientists seems to be mainly due to Patrick Wilson's (<a href="#wil83">1983</a>) <span>influential</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>book entitled <em>Second-hand knowledge. An inquiry into <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority</em>. Wilson characterized <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority by departing from the <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that people know the world in two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>ways: either based on their first-hand experiences of the everyday world, or on what they have learned second hand from others. However, only those who are deemed be individuals who '<em>know something we do not know</em>' and who '<em>know what they are talking about</em>' are recognized as <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authorities, at least to some <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#wil83">Wilson 1983</a>:  10; 13-14). This is because they are thought to be <span>intrinsically</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>plausible, convincing, persuasive and thus credible and worthy of belief; they are also perceived to be potentially able to influence <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>thinking in a specific <span>sphere</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of interest. Therefore, <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority is related to credibility. According to Wilson (<a href="#wil83">1983</a>:  15), <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority has two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>components, <span>namely</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>competence and trustworthiness. As Wilson (<a href="#wil83">1983</a>:  18) points out, <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authorities are valued not just for their stock of knowledge (answers to closed questions) but their opinions (answers to open questions). However, the <span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>plausibility of the answers thus given is not enough; they may be rejected if they are not compatible with the important <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and aspirations of the information seeker (<a href="#wil83">Wilson 1983</a>: 146-147).</p>

<p>Cognitive authority is not confined to individuals; this authority can also be recognized in institutions like university libraries and information sources such as <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>newspapers. Depending on the <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the questions needing answers, the <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority; for example, <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>newspaper columnists, may vary. In general, the more serious and the more involved a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is monitoring everyday events through the media, the more important is the authority of his or her information sources (<a href="#wil83">Wilson 1983</a>: 142-143). However, monitoring daily events through the media does not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>mean blind faith in these sources because they may be biased and more or less intentionally misleading. Thus, ideally, the reflective information seeker should constantly question the ultimate <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority of such sources.</p>

<p>By drawing on the above ideas, Rieh (<a href="#rie02">2002</a>) discussed <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority together with information <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in the specific context of Web searching. Information <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>was defined as <em>a user criterion which has to do with excellence or in some cases truthfulness in labeling</em>'. In turn, <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority was <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as something '<em>that a user would recognize as proper because the information therein is thought to be credible and worthy of belief'</em> (<a href="#rie02">Rieh 2002</a>:  146). <span>Cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority was operationalized as '<em>the extent to which users think they can trust the information'</em> (<a href="#rie02">Rieh 2002</a>:  146). These <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>suggest that the <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority and the credibility of information sources are closely related. Overall, <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority was characterized as having six facets; trustworthiness, reliability, scholarliness, credibility, '<em>officialness</em>' and authoritativeness; of these, trustworthiness was perceived as the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>facet (<a href="#rie02">Rieh 2002</a>:  153). The concept of information <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> defined by facets such as good, <span>accurate</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> current, useful and important, is closely related to <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority in that the users often make judgements on information <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>based on authority of sources (<a href="#rie02">Rieh 2002</a>:  158). On the other hand, the authority of sources proves the potential pool in which users can make judgements of information <span>quality</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>These <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>suggest that despite <span>terminological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>differences, the issues of <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority overlap with those of credibility of information sources. This is exemplified by Olaisen's (<a href="#ola90">1990</a>) study discussing credibility in electronic media. Interestingly, he equates <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority with influence and influence with credibility. Olaisen (<a href="#ola90">1990</a>):  92) proposed that when people process information they give credit and authority to certain persons and sources depending on their social position. Thus, <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>social position '<em>will greatly influence <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>factors like credibility (i.e., reliability), relevance and perceived value of information</em>' (<a href="#ola90">Olaisen 1990</a>):  92).</p>

<p>In a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>literature review, Wathen and Burkell (<a href="#wat02">2002</a>) clarified the entangled issues of the concept of credibility. In general, credibility may be <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by equating it with '<em>believability</em>' (<a href="#wat02">Wathen and Burkell 2002</a>:  135). Similar to <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority, credibility is always a perceived quality: as such, it does notre0e in an object, a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or piece of information but can be assigned to them as a result of a judgement made by a subject (<a href="#fog99">Fogg and Tseng 1999</a>:  80). In general, credible information sources may be described as trustworthy and having expertise similar to the assumptions presented by Rieh (<a href="#rie02">2002</a>) and Wilson (<a href="#wil83">1983</a>) above.</p>

<p>Most studies focusing on media or <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>credibility originate from communication research. The <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>studies date back to the early 1950s; <span>experimental</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>investigations were made to find out how modifications in <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>influence people's willingness to alter their <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to certain topics (<a href="#kio01">Kiousis 2001</a>: 383-384; <a href="#met03">Metzger <i>et al</i>. 2003</a>). This approach directs <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to the <span>qualities</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the sender of the message, as well as its content. These studies revealed, for example, that the trustworthiness of a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>significantly affects acceptance of the message and changes in opinion.</p>

<p>In turn, it is characteristic of studies on media credibility that they <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on the channel through which the content is delivered (<a href="#kio01">Kiousis 2001</a>:  382). Typically, these studies have explored the criteria by which diverse media such as newspapers, radio and television are perceived as believable sources of information. As early as in the 1950s, <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>surveys of media credibility were conducted in the United States by asking respondents to <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>which <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>they would believe if they got conflicting reports of the same news story from radio, television, magazines and newspapers (<a href="#met03">Metzger <i>et al</i>. 2003</a>:  306).</p>

<p>The advent of the Internet aroused new interest in the issues of media credibility (see, for example, <a href="#fla00">
Flanagin and Metzger 2000</a>; <a href="#joh98">Johnson and Kaye 1998</a>, <a href="#joh02">2002</a>; <a href="#sch00">Schweiger 2000</a>; <a href="#wat02">Wathen and Burkell 2002</a>). In these studies, the specificity of the research problems and the study populations vary con0erably. On the one hand, there are surveys exploring the ways in which the general public perceive the relative credibility of diverse media (see, for example, <a href="#kio01">Kiousis 2001</a>). On the other hand, the credibility studies may review specific topics such as university <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the credibility of scholarly information on the web (<a href="#liu04">Liu 2004</a>) or the <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the credibility of on-air versus online news among university <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and adults (<a href="#buc03">Bucy 2003</a>).</p>

<p>An <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>conducted in the <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>1990s in <span>Germany</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>revealed that the credibility of the Web was fairly high among the general public, although printed newspapers were rated ahead of it (Schweiger 2000: 49-51). Compared to the Web, newspapers were perceived as more clear, serious, thorough, <span>detailed</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> critical, generally credible, balanced, competent and professional. With <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to these <span>qualities</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> the differences between television and the Web were less significant. The Web was conceived of as more up-to-date than newspaper and television. On the one hand, newspapers were con0ered more biased than television and the Web. This is due to the fact that although most newspapers call themselves <span>neutral</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>they nevertheless do have a political bias. On the other hand, the greater bias of newspapers may be seen as positive since they articulate alternative <span>positions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in public discourse. Interestingly, when asked which <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>they would prefer in the case of contradictory news on the same issue, the respondents would mainly place their trust in traditional media (<a href="#sch00">Schweiger 2000</a>: 53-54). It <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that in these cases, 77% of Web users would rather trust newspapers than the Web and 72% of Web users indicated a preference for television. These <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>suggest that in terms of media credibility, people's preferences change slowly and that in cases of <span>doubt</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> people tend to favour traditional media.</p>

<p>These results were <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>conducted by Flanagin and Metzger (<a href="#fla00">2000</a>) in the United States. Newspapers were clearly rated the most credible <span>medium</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> In <span>comparison</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> the Internet and the World Wide Web, television, magazines and radio were perceived as less credible; however, the differences between these media <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to be marginal. Of the information types provided by these media, news, <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(factual information) and entertainment information were perceived to be more credible than commercial information (<a href="#fla00">Flanagin and Metzger 2000</a>: 524-525). This <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>was to be <span>expected</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> since commercial information is usually associated with manipulative intent and this impacts negatively on its trustworthiness.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the participants indicated that information obtained from the Internet is verified rarely or occasionally by using comparative data obtained from other sources (<a href="#fla00">Flanagin &amp; Metzger 2000</a>:  531). Information was verified only when this was easy to do, for example, by drawing on <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>opinion about the currency of the data. By contrast, there was low motivation for additional efforts to verify the qualifications of the author, for example. Factual information was verified more rigorously than either commercial or entertainment information, and news information was also verified more stringently than entertainment information. These <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>suggest that people are more motivated to verify information whose <span>accuracy</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is personally important for the information seeker, while misinformation encountered in <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>entertainment material is verified least rigorously.</p>

<p>More generally, it seems that evaluation of media credibility rarely takes place in a systematic and <span>rigorous</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>way. In practice, the attainment of this ideal is simply rendered difficult by <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of time. Thus the credibility judgements tend to remain at a general level. Burbules (<a href="#bur01">2001</a>:  450) has identified two paradoxes related to these limitations. Particularly in Web <span>contexts</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of sources is <span>absolutely</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>necessary, but the selectivity that is required to make credibility judgements conflicts with the comcomprehensivenessat is required as a <span>condition</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for other credibility judgements. On the other hand, too great comprehensiveness can itself be counter-productive to judgements of credibility. Therefore, the information seekers have to find a middle way between high selectivity and comprehensiveness. They have to draw on tacit preliminary judgements of the truthfulness of information sources of various types, and based on these assessments, an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>may be found interesting, relevant or useful (<a href="#bur01">Burbules 2001</a>:  448).</p>

<p>While judging the credibility of information sources, people may draw on their knowledge of the genre of the media and <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the information accordingly. Distinctions may be made between <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>newspapers and tabloids, for example (<a href="#fla00">Flanagin and Metzger 2000</a>:  517). <span>Sometimes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the credibility judgements may be based on collaborative efforts: like-minded people sharing a common interest or <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>may collectively evaluate the truthfulness and believability of information sources; Burbules (<a href="#bur01">2001</a>:  447) aptly <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to such activity as '<em>distributed credibility</em>'.</p>

<p>In <span>sum</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> the literature review revealed the complex and multidimensional nature of the concepts of media credibility and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority. Although these concepts overlap, both of them <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the issues of believability of information, even though with different <span>emphasis</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> This is also reflected in the study <span>approaches</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Studies on media credibility operate on a fairly general level by exploring the criteria by which people rate the believability of diverse media in relation to each other. In turn, studies on <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority tend to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on more specific questions concerning the ways in which individual sources of information are taken seriously and thus perceived to be capable of influencing people's thinking and decision-making. Thus, <span>ultimately</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> the issues of <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority have much in common with the questions of <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>credibility discussed by communication researchers.</p>

<h2>Research questions and <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>data</h2>

<p>To explore the above issues from the <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of everyday life information seeking studies, an <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>case study was conducted. The <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>study addresses two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>research questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In which ways do people perceive media credibility and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority in the context of seeking orienting information?</li>
  <li>Are there any differences in the ways in which people judge the credibility and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority of information sources of various types?</li>
</ul>

<p>The <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>data were gathered August to September 2005 in the city of Tampere, Finland by interviewing twenty environmental activists. The participants were mainly recruited through the electronic mailing lists of the local associations for environmental issues. Overall, the activists were recruited for the study because it was assumed that they are <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>information seekers and motivated to articulate their experiences as users of diverse sources and channels. This <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to be correct, and the interviews yielded rich <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>data.</p>

<p>Of the participants, fourteen were females and six males. The ages of the informants varied from twenty-one to fifty-nine, averaging thirty-four years. Eight participants had university degrees, five had completed occupational <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were university undergraduates. Several occupations were <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>among the informants, for example, engineering, guiding, taxi-driving and <span>teaching</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Of the participants, four had a permanent job and five temporary employment, whereas three were unemployed and one was on maternity leave.</p>

<p>The semi-structured interviews took about one hour on average. In the interviews, the participants were first asked to characterize their ways of seeking orienting and problem-specific information, in particular, the <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>preference criteria employed in these <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>focusing on these issues will be reported in <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>studies, see <a href="#savipa">Savolainen in press-a</a> and <a href="#savipb">in press-b</a>). While discussing the <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of seeking orienting information, the participants described the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>problems they typically face when monitoring everyday events through media. At this point, they were encouraged to characterize their experiences obtained in the encounter with conflicting information about environmental issues, and their ways to resolve such discrepancies. More specifically, they were asked to characterize their ways of assessing the credibility of information sources and the criteria by which they find a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>believable or unbelievable. The <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>data were analysed by means of <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>content analysis (<a href="#lin85">Lincoln &amp; <span>Guba</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>1985</a>). In practice, the analysis proceeded by constantly comparing the articulations of experiences related to the encounter with conflicting information in the context of seeking orienting information.</p>

<h2>Empirical findings</h2>

<p>The analysis of the interview data indicated that printed media (newspapers), the Internet and broadcast media (radio, television) were preferred in seeking orienting information (the preference criteria will be discussed in greater detail in another study, see <a href="#savipa">Savolainen in press-a</a>). The most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>mentioned <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>preferences were content of information, and availability and accessibility, while usability of information sources, user <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>such as media habits, and situational factors were mentioned less <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as preference criteria.</p>

<p>Nine interviewees out of twenty felt it difficult to identify the most credible media or information sources used to monitor everyday events. They were not able to give any definite answer to questions such as whether, for example, a newspaper was more credible than the Internet in cases of encountering contradictory information. The frequent answer was: '<em>it depends</em>'. Media credibility was perceived to be situationally sensitive and closely related to the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of interest when monitoring events through media or personal sources. However, eleven interviewees out of twenty had a general level priority with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to media credibility: four interviewees relied most heavily on the focused information distributed by the environmental associations through newsletters or mailing lists, for example, while three participants found individuals personally known to them as most credible sources. Other sources mentioned in this context included e-mail discussion (two interviewees), intranet (one participant) and newspaper (one participant). Interestingly, broadcast media (radio and television) were not rated among the most credible sources, even though television <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to be a fairly popular <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of orienting information.</p>

<h2>Encountering conflicting information</h2>

<p>The interviewees identified a number of situations in which they had encountered contradictory information about environmental issues in particular. In most cases, such information was encountered when <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>newspapers or using the networked sources; human sources such as members of environmental associations were mentioned rarely in this context. In most cases, the encounter with conflicting information concerned the disparate ways of interpreting the <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of individual events, for example, appeals to protect forests issued by environmental associations.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the interviewees did not recognize absolute <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authorities on which they would draw in order to make sense of conflicting information. Instead, the <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>own reflection was <span>emphasized</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<blockquote>I may rely most on the intranet but not always. Most of all, I rely on my own experience and my <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and filter things. I also draw on my university studies, that is, my professional background.</blockquote>

<p>In itself, the provision of conflicting views through the media was not seen as a bad thing. By contrast, the existence of alternative viewpoints is welcome since they <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that <span>ultimately</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> most issues discussed in the media are complex. Therefore, it is very difficult to make sense of them by drawing on a single explanation logic.</p>

<blockquote>In fact, it is good if there is conflicting information available. That's why I monitor the Arabian Al-Jazeera news, too, if there happen to be big events. But in itself, I do not rely on any <span>medium</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> I may <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>conflicting or consistent information about the same issue. Then, I will just try to take my view of it. I have my own philosophy and according to it I cannot say that this or that view is <span>absolutely</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>right or <span>wrong</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>because things are not as simple they generally look. (P-1)</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes, the encounter with conflicting information may motivate the information seeker to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on the ways in which the events are reported in the media. As one of the interviewees (P-4) put it, '<i>I may wonder whatever the writer means by this, what is his or her specialty and did he or she really know this issue</i>?'; Naturally, such reflections do not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>lead to further efforts to challenge the competence of the reporter by calling him or her or <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a critical reply to Letters to the Editor (cf. <a href="#fla00">Flanagin and Metzger 2000</a>). Only one of the the interviewees (P-3) had been very active in this respect; in most cases, however, the local newspaper had refused to <span>publish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>her comments.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the hasty readers of morning newspapers or those browsing short news on the Web before leaving for work may not have time to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the issues of media credibility in greater detail.</p>

<blockquote>I'm used to browsing the daily news after having opened the net, all news are there. At least, I will read the headings. Actually, I have not found any strange differences there compared to the newspaper. (P-15)</blockquote>

<p>Contradictory information was most <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>identified when the media report on environmental issues that are politically sensitive.</p>

<blockquote>Well, there are such situations. For example, the short news distributed by the Finnish Information Bureau and other news agencies tend to provide <span>identical</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>facts. But more <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>reports discussing the construction of the Vuotos reservoir or such things tend to bring out conflicting issues, depending on the viewpoint taken. (P-4)</blockquote>

<h2>Judging media credibility and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority</h2>

<p>We may specify the above picture by more <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>discussion of the ways in which media credibility and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority were assessed in the context of two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>media used in seeking orienting information, that is, newspapers and the Internet. Other media, for example, television and radio will not be discussed here because in the interviewees <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to their credibility only very occasionally.</p>

<h3>Newspapers</h3>

<p>In general, newspapers were perceived as somewhat more credible information sources than television and radio. However, the interviewees were not able to specify this general preference in greater detail. One of the participants (P-2) <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that '<i>basically, the printed word is more <span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>than the spoken word or words presented in electronic form</i>'. However, not all that is printed in newspapers is <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>beyond all <span>doubt</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<blockquote>Printed newspapers have to put information on their pages quite early and an event that has been reported there may have changed by the time the newspaper is available. Newspapers may therefore not be <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>up-to-date. Television is a little bit better in this respect, but anyway, I don't believe one hundred percent in all the stuff that is provided through it. (P-14)</blockquote>

<p>However, in most cases, the credibility of newspapers was challenged on the basis of ideology. One of the interviewees (P-3) indicated that she occasionally boycotts <i>Aamulehti</i>, the dominant local newspaper because of its political bias. Even though <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>newspapers such as <em>Aamulehti</em> sometimes provide information that influences <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>thinking characteristic of a <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority, a fairly sceptical stance on news from this <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>was apparent among many interviewees.</p>

<blockquote>Well, sometimes there are visiting columnists that provide alternative viewpoints. But usually the newspaper favours ideas that substantially contradict my thoughts. (P-20)</blockquote>

<p>In the  judgement of the credibility of information provided by the newspapers, the type of news is important. Short news providing individual facts about the damage caused by hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in August 2005 may be perceived as highly credible. On the other hand, full <span>length</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>articles or columns speculating on the ways in which the damage could have been avoided may not only <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with technical <span>details</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> for example, the construction of the levees that burst in New Orleans. Political issues may also be speculated, for example, by asking why the Bush administration did not take measures to strengthen the levees in time. Obviously, a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>factor affecting the credibility of newspapers is the way in which the journalists are able to give reasons for their <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of environmental issues that are politically sensitive.</p>

<blockquote>This is not an easy question. Naturally, a competent and ambitious journalist may take a strong stand on an issue. So, his or her explanation model may become <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>more widely than alternative viewpoints, for example, when discussing climate change. However, if another viewpoint draws on the mainstream of the scientific discourse, this view may be presented as an alternative, at least in some way.  (P-2)</blockquote>

<p>In order to enhance the credibility of an article, the journalist may interview experts such as academic researchers when drafting the text, but often he or she has to simplify things in the final version and highlight some issues at the expense of others. This suggests that, in most cases, the ideal of a newspaper article based on multi-perspective and impartial evidence may remain unattainable and the arguments presented in the article may be biased. Some interviewees felt that such biases seem to be particularly characteristic of articles reporting on economically sensitive topics such the protection of forests. Those <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a critical stance on the local newspaper <em>Aamulehti</em> claimed that its articles discussing environmental topics tend to place too much <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on the economic aspects, while insufficient <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is devoted to issues of environmental protection. Articles biased in this way may promote counter-reactions among individual readers or groups of like-minded people.</p>

<blockquote>It is well-known that the <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of newspaper articles politicised activity and thus conflicting information <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>results. As to these issues, I will primarily look out for how they report on my activities or the activities of our association. Of course, about some issues, remarkably discrepant information will be published. Thinking of the environmental protection, I find it very annoying, because this information is reported in such a purpose-related way. (P-8)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nowadays I'm too tired to write as many rejoinders to the newspapers as before, but I have done it a lot, by calling journalists. However, they don't change what they have written. But we <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>come across with sissuessues and process them because they intentionally write about environmental and nature protection in an untruthful way. (P-3)</blockquote>

<p>Interestingly, in the above case, the environmental activists drew on the &rdquo;distributed credibility&rdquo; <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to by Burbules (<a href="#bur01">2001</a>). The <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>issue is how to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the viewpoint provided by the newspaper because it is obvious that the way in which environmental issues are interpreted conflicts with the <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>adopted by the environmental activists. In such cases, they discussed the issue by phone or by e-mail and <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>their picture of the debatable question. Drawing on the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of like-minded people, the arguments presented in the newspaper article were critically evaluated and an alternative viewpoint developed. Depending on the <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the case, the alternative view was communicated to other people active in environmental issues by using the mailing <span>list</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> for example.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, the  judgements presented by people <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with local environmental issues were found more credible than newspaper articles. Since journalists do not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>know the local <span>details</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> they may report the events too generally or dramatise the <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of individual events. This was exemplified by the case speculating on the number of wolves running wild fairly close to the city of Tampere.</p>

<blockquote>They (journalists of <strong>Aamulehti</strong>) speculated that there were no less than ten wolves, but in fact there were only one or two at most. <strong>Aamulehti</strong> reported on the large number of wolves, while <strong>Helsingin Sanomat</strong> (the biggest newspaper in Finland) did not do so. But I know local people who have seen only two wolves there. <strong>Helsingin Sanomat</strong> published an objective article and they drew on the views of researchers maintaining that there are no more than three wolves in that <span>region</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> But anyway, I rely more on experts, for example, local hunters than the opinions of the man in the street. The same applies to the issue of the flying squirrel. I guess only a few people have ever seen one. (P-11)</blockquote>

<p>The above quote suggests that the credibility judgements of newspapers may develop over time, as the same issue is debated and comparative information is available from supplementary sources. In this way, these judgements become constitutive elements of the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>process of information use. On the other hand, the credible judgements may also affect how the newspapers will be preferred in <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>situations of seeking orienting information, compared to human sources, for example.</p>

<h3>The Internet</h3>

<p>Unsurprisingly, most interviewees were well aware of the general credibility problems plaguing the Internet, for example, the fact that it may be difficult to identify high-quality information amidst the vast amount of lower <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> unfiltered material. Despite these problems, the Internet was perceived as a relatively credible <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of information that may supplement newspapers and other media. In particular, factual information was perceived to be equally credible in the Internet and in the printed newspaper.</p>

<p>However, the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to which networked sources of various <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were perceived as credible varied among the interviewees. Discussion groups open to all those interested in environmental issues were approached critically because '<i>anyone may write anything there</i>' (P-6). However, information distributed through the mailing lists accessible only to members of environmental associations was found credible, particularly if the sender of the message was personally known. This <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is in accordance with the <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that objects or persons the actor is <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with seem to increase their liking and thus influence credibility judgements (<a href="#met03">Metzger <i>et al</i>. 2003</a>: 303-304).</p>

<p>Overall, factual information such as announcements about forthcoming events distributed by environmental associations was perceived as <span>reliable</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Compared to newspaper articles, the material distributed by the associations was found more credible.</p>

<blockquote>Comparing Aamulehti and the bulletins issued by (environmental) associations, the events in the Greenpeace camp in the north last spring were approached differently. In addition, there were differences in reporting between Aamulehti and television news programmmes. However, I know that in fact, things there (in the camp) were not like they were presented in the media. (P-20)</blockquote>

<blockquote>I would rely more on information issued by Amnesty because it has specialized in questions dealing with human rights. (P-10)</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, the material, for example, electronic newsletters circulated by the environmental associations may also provide '<i>propagandistic elements</i>'. Similarly, messages sent through the mailing <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>may contain opinions that are '<i>coloured</i>' or '<i>emotional</i>', as two of the participants (P-14 and P-17) put it. The interviewees felt, however, that in principle all opinions, including those presented by the <em>in0ers</em> should be subjected to critical con0eration. In particular, if information thus obtained is used to write a newsletter, the credibility of the <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>will be <span>checked</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>more carefully than usually. This is because the ways in which people <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>things tend to vary. Some people are broad minded and less interested in technical <span>details</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> while others draw on facts and are less interested to present ideologically-coloured conclusions.</p>

<blockquote>Naturally, when we talk about issues of these <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in our association, I do rely on us! On the other hand, there is seldom need to deliberate the reliability of 'our own people' because at least 97 percent of our internal communication is based on sharing information: news obtained from electronic newspapers, newsletters issued by our interest groups, tips on research studies and <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to them, progress reports of various projects and announcements of forthcoming events. It is relatively easy to communicate information like this. However, everyone should then select information and assess how well it will serve <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>own needs.  (P-8)</blockquote>

<p>Low hierarchies characteristic of networked communication forums seem to make it difficult to identify contributors who may be recognized as <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authorities or opinion leaders. The interviewees felt that the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>factor influencing the credibility of human sources is the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to which they are able to provide useful and <span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>information. Even though there may be long-time activists, these people may not be able to provide the final word. This is characteristic of the environmental debates that are also going on in other networked forums.</p>

<blockquote>For example, there is highly conflicting information available about the global warming of the climate and the melting of glaciers, as well as the stopping of the Gulf Stream. Because of the discrepant views, it may be very difficult for the individual to form a conception of these issues. The experts are fighting with each other by asserting that 'I'm right in this and he is <span>wrong</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>, while others argue the other way around. (P-6)</blockquote>

<p>Naturally, similar debates may be found in television documentaries, popular science magazines and in newspaper articles. However, it is apparent that the networked forums, in particular, have eroded belief in the existence of absolute <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authorities of environmental issues. More generally, these developments imply strengthened scepticism about <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>conclusive answers to complex issues and increasing <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to judge credibility of alternative information sources.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>The concepts of media credibility and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority provide <span>novel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>viewpoints to explore factors affecting the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and use of sources of orienting information. The above concepts supplement each other in that media credibility deals with the criteria by which diverse media are generally perceived as believable in relation to each other. The questions of <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority concentrate on the ways in which individual sources are recognized as competent and trustworthy enough to be taken seriously and thus capable of influencing the individual's thinking and decision-making.</p>

<p>The <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>case study showed that most people find it difficult to assess questions of <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority and media credibility in a general sense, for example, by comparing the overall credibility of newspapers and the Internet. Thus these assessments tend to be situationally sensitive. Newspapers, television and the Internet were <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>used as sources of orienting information, but their credibility varied depending on the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>topic at hand. The environmental activists relied most heavily on thematically focused sources providedorganizationsions such as environmental associations. In a way, these associations and their sub-groups <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by like-minded environmental activists may be characterized as small <span>worlds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in terms of Chatman (<a href="#cha91">1991</a>) because they tend to put more faith in <em>first-hand knowledge</em> produced within this world than in <em>second-hand knowledge</em> provided by out0ers, for example, newspapers. However, in contrast to the low-skilled workers reviewed by Chatman, the environmental activists did not reject the second-hand knowledge outright as alien to their world but subjected it to critical analysis, for example, in relation to potential political bias.</p>

<p>In the judgement of conflicting information available in alternative sources, the role of <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>own critical reflection was <span>emphasized</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as the final instance. Even though <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>columnists of <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>newspapers and experienced environmental activists may influence <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>thinking in specific cases, they were not explicitly accorded the <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of a <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority. Overall, the participants took a critical attitude to the role of ultimate <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authorities, be they individuals, such as experts debating on global climate warming, or organizational sources, such as newspapers reporting on the issues of forest protection. In particular, the Internet seems to have eroded the belief in the authority of <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>sources like dominant local newspapers. The networked information sources and news services provide new opportunities for the development of <em>distributed credibility</em>, that is, the critical <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of information sources among like-minded people. On the other hand, there is no blind faith in the opinions provided by the old-time environmental activists because their view may be biased in some way. Hence, there is a <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>need for the critical reflection of the viewpoints provided by the in0ers, too.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Perceived media credibility and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority significantly, however, often implicitly orient the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and use of information sources. As the present study is exploratory in nature and the number of participants was fairly low, there is a need to undertake comparative investigations in order to explore the <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority among other study populations. To provide a broader context for these studies, the issues of relative media credibility should be explored by comparing the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to which diverse media are perceived as believable. The research settings might also be enriched by exploring problem-specific information seeking both in job-related and non-work <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The role of the networked sources and services would be particularly interesting since it is apparent that the Internet will significantly change the <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of media credibility and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authority.</p>

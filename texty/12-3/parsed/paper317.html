<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Community networks have been <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to provide local communities with <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or low-cost electronic access to information content and a variety of electronic communication resources. The movement can be <span>traced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>back to the first <span>experimental</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>community networking project in the mid-1970s created by the City of Berkeley, California, to help strengthen the local <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Later, in 1984, a single modem <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and a basic <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>provided access to a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>created by the City of Cleveland, Ohio. In the 1990s, <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks began to provide information services that could potentially enhance their local communities. Those involved in developing and designing the Blacksburg Community Network decided to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on local people and provided access to as many re0ents as possible.</p>

<p>The recent trend of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks is to provide not only Internet access and e-mail, but also, more importantly, to provide information resources for their communities. Community networks have also led to a new type of social movement providing a variety of services for the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>using a variety of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>capabilities (<a href="#sch96">Schuler 1996</a>; <a href="#kub02">Kubicek <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>). As <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of social activism, <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks address the digital divide by providing equitable and meaningful access to technology (<a href="#loa00">Loader 2000</a>; <a href="#tho97">Thompsen 1997</a>), which increases civic participation in political <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Community networks potentially strengthen democracy by providing another way for citizens to communicate with government officials and to access government information (<a href="#sch96">Schuler 1996</a>). Community networks have given local government a new opportunity to deliver services and expand economic development for its citizens. They streamline internal operations of municipal government, improve delivery of town services to citizens and businesses, reduce traffic congestion and air pollution, bring new educational opportunities to local <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and help local businesses prosper in a global marketplace (<a href="#gra00">Graham 2000</a>). As <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks are important to communities in social, economic and political terms, they should also ideally be a part of the physical <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by integrating with the cultural, economic, environmental, political and social fabric (<a href="#str98">Strickland 1998</a>).</p>

<p>Analysts have further argued that ideal <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks should be <span>designed</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> used, administered and owned by the host <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to help revitalise, strengthen, and expand existing social networks in the locality: 'A <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is a locally based, locally driven communication and information system <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to enhance <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and enrich lives' (<a href="#sch96">Schuler 1996</a>: 32). While this study shares Schuler's definition, <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks in this study are somewhat <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>from the early types of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks that are Internet-based and are <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to access and use. Community networks in this study are subscription-based and only organizations (institutional subscribers) could participate. In addition, technologies used for <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks in this study are <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>telecommunications that beyond simple Internet access.

<p>The definition in this study reflects the current developments of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks. These days, <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks extend beyond a fibre backbone through a variety of wired and wireless technologies to enable greater accessibility and to provide both <span>fixed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and mobile communications and computing. Recently, there has been a <span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>trend of some municipalities to deploy broadband <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks such as fibre optic and <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>wireless broadband networks. At national levels, it is an emerging trend to build wireless electronic communities to link homes, <span>schools</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> libraries, hospitals and small businesses to this information super highway. Building an effective <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>information infrastructure has become a high priority to governments in the world. Just as the telecommunications infrastructure provides the transport means for the information economy to develop, creating the infrastructure for information itself is becoming a key agenda at national, regional and global levels. As government initiative forms the foundations in creating an information infrastructure, governments initiate projects to improve telecommunications infrastructures and to construct new channels that are more <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and accessible. Such projects include Korea's IT839, the UK's <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/5NvAZ7bcy" target="_blank">IT for All</a>, the <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/5NvB6037D" target="_blank">Global/National Information Infrastructure</a> of the U.S. and Canada's <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/5NvBawYPN" target="_blank">Information Highway</a>. Globally, the <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/5NvBezoIx" target="_blank">World Summit on the Information Society</a> has discussed <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the foundations for an information society for all.</p>

<p>In the USA, <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks can be seen within this background of National Information Infrastructure, which was initiated by the Clinton Administration. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology on the National Information Infrastructure suggests: 'all Americans will have access to a wealth of information in a number of arenas, from health care to history, from poetry to physics. In the next century the information infrastructure will be the means by which most Americans receive information and the data, the imagery and the sounds it conveys will shape the very ideas of what culture is....' (<a href="#nii93">National Institute... 1993</a>: 9). Pre0ent Clinton's Executive Order of September 15, 1993 (<a href="#nii93">NII 1993</a>), defined the National Information Infrastructure as 'the <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>hardware</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and skills that will make it easy and affordable to connect people with each other, with computers and with a vast array of services and information resources' (<a href="#civ93">Civille <em>et al.</em> 1993</a>). Further, the National Information Infrastructure Act of 1996 (<a href="#nii96">Amended from 1996 of H.<span>R++</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> 3723 1996</a>) states that information infrastructure should 'directly benefit all people', provide 'large economic and social benefits' and be 'designed to be accessible and usable by all, including historically and economically under-served populations and individuals with disabilities, in the fields of <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> libraries, health care, the provision of government information and other appropriate fields'(:Clause 3).</p>

<p>Despite these emphatic emphases, however, National Information Infrastructure has not been successful in fulfilling the social provisions, although they have been effective in implementing physical networks (<a href="#bor00">Borgman 2000</a>). Focusing on this <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>principle, the present study reports on a broadband <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks in Central New York State, funded by the New York State Advanced Telecommunication Program. This study focuses on the processes involved in the development of the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>under the Program and evaluates the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>project by tracing their development from <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>design to their stabilisation as information infrastructure. It also examines the <span>direction</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> nature and <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of these <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>developments by looking at the following research question: how are broadband <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks planned, <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and implemented in communities? To answer these questions, the study employs an in-depth case study approach. It focuses mainly on the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>from the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the Program in 1996 to its ending in 2003. This study collected <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and quantitative data  primarily through in-depth interviews, drawing on the retrospective data of diverse stakeholders: strategic policy groups, user groups, technical groups and the project team. </p>

<p>The <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>findings can be briefly summarized. First, unlike the initial goals of the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> technological 
complexity biased the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>development toward the interests of the project team and away from <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>benefits. 
The picture is quite consistent with Castells'(<a href="#cas96">1996</a>) argument that high technology creates 
a dichotomous logic, dividing the resource rich from the resource poor. Second, the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>development was powerfully 
<span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by the interests of the project team and Verizon. In particular, Verizon saw the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as a means to cut 
their telecommunications costs by replacing existing services with sub0ized services. The <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>project's social goals receded in importance as the process unfolded and the economic interests of the 
project team and their political clout with Verizon emerged as decisive shaping forces. They were seen by the 
Program Committee as vital 'to get the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>up and running' by being early adopters and their influence 
stemmed from their putative role as guarantors of the project going forward. As innovator, their interests were 
con0ered <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>having an <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>technology <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>at all. Yet, their <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as innovators 
seem to be biased toward a political role. In <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>development, institutions that 'mediate' (<a href="#att92">Attewell 1992</a>) between an innovation and the adopter can play two possible roles: a pragmatic role (facilitating broad participation by helping to lower knowledge barriers) and a political role (empowering the marginalized and advocating minority interests). In the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in this study, the two <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>were <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or played negatively. </p>

<p>A currently operated <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> the A-Net  in Central New York State, was selected for in-depth analysis. Located in the suburban area of Albany, New York, the A-Net is a multi-agency partnership to serve areas from Albany to the Canadian border, covering about one fifth of the area of New York State. The A-Net is funded by New York State Community Program whose goals were: (1) building <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>owned, operated and managed <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks; (2) benefiting communities by inter-organizational <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>(across agency jurisdictions, for example, <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>schools and college) and by inter-sectoral <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>(across sectors, for example, <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and health care); (3) serving economically and socially under-served communities. Through <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks, the Program Committee wished to run distance learning, tele-medicine, <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>portals, e-government and broadband connectivity. </p>

<p>The A-Net was  awarded an <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>grant to build a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>network for <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>connects eighty institutions with the broadband  Internet and video <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>provides connectivity for institutions ranging from small nursing homes to large hospitals primarily through frame-relay technology with bandwidths from two Mbps to three Mbps. The infrastructure enables the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to serve all its partners and allows <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to many other technologies such as ISDN and T-1.

<h2>Theoretical framework</h2>

<p>Using the evaluative <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Construction of Technology, this study examines the <span>direction</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> nature and results of the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>development. <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Construction of Technology is an effective tool for the <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the technology developmental processes and the <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is focused on analysing the process by which a social system develops along certain <span>lines</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> how this trajectory is maintained or reproduced and how its character changes over time. The <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Construction of Technology <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is particularly useful for this study for three reasons. </p>

<p>First, it has many advantages over other similar <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>(e.g., Actor Network Theory) for the present study; it  is more methodologically robust than others and better articulated because it breaks down the technology development and change into <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>but inter-related processes. The goal is not to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>prescriptive or normative principles to be applied to any <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>study, but rather to offer guidelines that can be useful in analysing and describing a technology development. Its <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>function is, according to Pinch and Bijker's (<a href="#pin84">1984</a>), is 'heuristic': it helps to  highlight all aspects that are relevant for the researcher's purpose. </p>

<p>Second, <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Construction of Technology goes beyond the traditional social <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by examining the content of technology and the processes involved in technology development. The traditional social <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>only study the outcome of technology change. <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Construction of Technology analysts study technology content to see the socio-economic patterns embedded in both the content of technologies and the processes of innovation to be exposed and analysed. <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Construction of Technology seeks the character and influence of the shaping forces and attempts to grasp the complexity of the socio-economic processes involved in technological innovation. </p>

<p>Third, <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Construction of Technology enables this study to take a dialectical approach. The dialectical view is focused on analysing the process by which a social system develops along certain <span>lines</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> how this trajectory is maintained or reproduced and how its character changes over time (<a href="#ven02">Venkastesh and Shin 2002</a>). With this view, Venkatesh and Shin (<a href="#ven02">2002</a>) <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the developmental analysis of the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks, which developed within the socio-political context of the city and had explicit and progressive social goals included in its morphology.

<p>These <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>fit the goals of the present study by allowing us to trace the development of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks at the technological and social levels without distinguishing or categorizing between them. <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Construction of Technology has been applied to the analysis of a variety of artefacts&mdash;bicycles (<a href="#bij95">Bijker 1995</a>; <a href="#ros93">Rosen 1993</a>), missile <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> (<a href="#mck90">McKenzie 1990</a>), air conditioning (<a href="#coo98">Cooper 1998</a>), the telephone (<a href="#cow97">Cowan 1997</a>)&mdash;but they have rarely been used to examine information and communication technologies in general and <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks in particular. <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks, as technologies that develop in social communities, must be examined as social objects.

<li>interpretative flexibility, which suggests that technology <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is an open process that can produce different outcomes, depending on the social circumstances of development. <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Construction of Technology scholars apply the concept of interpretative flexibility to technological artefacts to show how artefacts are the product of inter group negotiations;</li>
<li>the concept of the relevant social groups, which embody particular interpretations: '<em>all members of a certain social group share the same set of meanings, attached to a specific artefact</em>' (<a href="#pin84">Pinch and Bijker 1984</a>: 30).

<h2>Background to the research: The State Community Program</h2> 

<p>As part of a regulatory settlement, the New York State Public Service Commission required Verizon to fund a broadband infrastructure. The funds were designated for telecommunications infrastructure, customer premises <span>equipment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and related training for disadvantaged <span>regions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in New York State that are served by Verizon. These geographically remote areas and under-served urban areas, would not have access to <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>services if the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>were left to market forces. This project was called the New York State Advanced Telecommunication Project. The Program Committee selected economically disadvantaged areas by six telephone area <span>codes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in Verizon's service area. The Program Committee made a comprehensive <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of criteria that were used to specify economically depressed areas in the state for Program <span>purposes</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The Program decided to use a competitive request for proposals process to solicit proposals from eligible consortia of public sector institutions (city and county government agencies, <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>schools and higher educational institutions), <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations, health care and human service agencies and small <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>entities. Community consortia had to apply and go through a competitive process. Successful <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>consortia made the case for using the funds to benefit the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and serve public interests. One of the preferred provisions was an inter-sectoral <span>applications</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> for example, linking <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>sector to medical facilities connected to <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as well as nursing homes. The Program designated the project team comprising leaders from various state agencies, public interest groups and Verizon. The project team provided local planning and implementation grants to local consortia and was <span>supposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to promote the development of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and regional collaborations to deploy <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>telecommunication infrastructure, as a way of supporting economic development, educational <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> health and human service delivery and labour workforce development.</p>

 
<h2>Research question and data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>methods</h2>

<p>The following research question guided the investigation: How was a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>planned, <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and implemented in a local community? The research question addresses the relationships between the developmental context, the form and the function of the networks. The interest is in documenting the social processes through which these networks came to acquire their <span>characteristics</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> This study investigates how the interests and <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of social groups constitute or shape the forms, contents and functions of networks. Some sub-questions include: What social groups <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or were unable to influence the development of these networks? and, What technological frames were used to influence how these social groups interpreted these networks? </p>

<p>This study involved multiple data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>methods such as interviews, analysis of archival material, surveys, content <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and participation observation. The study conducted in-depth face-to-face and telephone interviews with people associated <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>with the projects such as project team members, as well as people who were associated indirectly with the project like representatives of areas of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>development, which is relevant to the Program goals. Respondents were asked to look back at events that occurred in the past and reconstruct and <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>them. Respondents talked about their experiences with the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>projects, their interpretation from implementation and development through the evolution and <span>conclusion</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the project. At least six years were <span>investigated</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> from the very <span>origin</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks to their installation in the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and uses by entities in that <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> so that it could trace the changes, if any, to the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks. In addition to interviews, archival project materials were analysed such as the project proposal, material prepared by project personnel on the technical and managerial aspects of the project, material generated by the Program Committee, Verizon and others and material generated by prospective users. Survey questionnaires were sent to <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> subscribing organizations and telephone companies to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>factual data such as regional information, demographics and governmental information. The questions focused on the technology infrastructure, the technologies being used, the number of subscribers and <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>uses. Finally, informal supplementary data were collected through phone calls, e-mail messages, casual talks and faxes, to clarify and follow up information. </p>

<h3>Relevant social groups of the A-Net development</h3>

<p>The participants involved in the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>project not only had different experience, technical knowledge and goals, but also they differed in their ability to influence the project and were composed of three groups: <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>groups, the project team and Verizon. According to eight functional <span>categorization</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of communities set by the Program Committee, <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>groups in the A-Net can be grouped into four functional sectors: health care facilities, <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>schools and Boards of Co-operative Educational Services, higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations. Several local technology vendors also participated in the A-Net project. These local technology vendors provided technical <span>equipment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>such as networking and tele-medicine at a reduced rate. The project team in this case was <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and his six <span>associates</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> who played a leadership role in the project.</p>

<p>The project team was headed by <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>who was the Head of Information Systems at Albany Medical College at the time he developed the project proposal. <span>Smith</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>s project plan was developed while he was at the College. As he became the Chair of Tele-medicine Project in 1996, he and his colleagues in the Information System Division developed a telecommunications <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>connecting three branch hospitals that comprised the College. <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>was directed by the college to build a <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>inter-connecting these three campuses to enable delivery of tele-medicine. Under his <span>direction</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> his staff began to study possible <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that would transport voice and video content along0e of data streams. The <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>they developed is now known as the Adirondack Rural Health Network. With his experience in the development of the Adirondack Rural Health Network, <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>decided to develop a community-wide tele-medicine <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>realized that just as he had <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the tele-medicine <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to cover the three hospitals that together comprise the Medical College, so he could create <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>tele-medicine networks connecting various institutions <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the vast geographic area of Central New York area. </p>

<p>Smith shared his idea with the Director of Network Services at the Adirondack Medical Centre, whom he knew from his membership of the Medical Centre Tele-medicine Committee. The Adirondack Medical Centre was con0ering entering into tele-medicine and <span>Smith</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>s plan was timely and persuasive to them. In 1996, when the Program Committee issued the first round request for soliciting proposals, <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>saw the opportunity to get an initial grant to realize his plan. He <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that winning a grant from the Program would give his project the legitimacy and credentials to bring other funds in. <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and his group contacted state senators, congressmen and the governor for support.  <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>said: 'using politicians was only one factor in making A-Net work, but they were nonetheless <span>essential</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>.. particularly in the <span>beginning</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> to bring funds in'.  In the <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of 1996, <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>hosted a meeting inviting <span>prominent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>community leaders from the area covered by the project to <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the Program request for proposals and his plan. Invitees included representatives from four Boards of Co-operative Educational Services, twenty-one <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>schools, two medical <span>schools</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> one <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>legal service organization and nine hospitals. At the meeting, <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and his colleagues highlighted the significant need for tele-medicine in the <span>region</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> After the State funds were awarded, many regional technology vendors came forward to support the project. Staff from Compression Lab, RadVision, VTEL, Polycom and Medinformatic, which were medical <span>equipment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>suppliers, contributed technical expertise to the project. These organizations could receive a matching fund from the State by assisting <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>projects.</p>

<h3>Different interpretative flexibilities in the development of A-Net</h3>

<p>At the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the project, the participants of the A-Net had the following different <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 
<ul>
    <li>Project team: A-Net as an inter-organizational tele-medicine system </li>
    <li>Verizon: A-Net as a municipal telecommunications infrastructure </li>
    <li>Health care facilities: A-Net as a tele-medicine tool </li>
    <li>Educational institutions: A-Net as a pedagogical tool </li>
    <li>Community organizations: A-Net as an Internet ramp and <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>portal </li>
    <li>Regional planning department: no interpretation and no intention to participation </li>
</ul> 

<p>As initiators, planners and developers of the A-Net, the project team had a master plan for tele-medicine in the very <span>beginning</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> They planned to build a platform for an intra-sectoral <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of tele-medicine that could facilitate information-sharing among health care facilities. The subscriber groups had end-user perspectives concerning <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services, such as tele-medicine, economic development and distance learning. These groups, however, did not have a clear idea and operational plan for how to implement and manage the <span>applications</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> because they lacked technical expertise (The subscriber groups relied on the project team for their technical expertise). In addition, their perspectives tended to be <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to their own organizations; they saw the A-Net in terms of their own specific and urgent needs. The interpretation of the subscriber groups can be seen as 'partial', as <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the comprehensive interpretation of the project team. The Program Committee had a comprehensive view of the A-Net and <span>eventually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>envisaged a state-wide interconnected <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Verizon was less concerned about <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services; <span>instead</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> they were more concerned with infrastructure. The Regional Planning Department, which was required to participate, was never involved in the A-Net and as such had no interpretation of the A-Net. In addition, there were economic development groups whose <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>were <span>limited</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> The Chamber of Commerce of the Adirondack area was not aware of the Program and the A-Net and did not have any involvement with the development.</p>

<h3>Project team: A-Net as inter-organizational medical system</h3>

<p>As mentioned earlier, the Program Committee required inter-sectoral <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in their Program guidelines. Inter-sectoral <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>refer to <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that cover a cross-section of the <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> for example, a <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>school connected not just to other <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>but to the public safety building. Despite this provision of inter-sectoral <span>applications</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> the project team only <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>inter-organizational linkages within sector. The project team recruited a set of subscribers from each sector, i.e., a set of health care participants, a set of <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>participants, etc. There was little <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>between these sectoral sets. Instead, there were ongoing <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>within the sectoral sets, for example, medical information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and inter-hospital networking projects. Because there were a <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>number of health care facilities in the <span>region</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> such inter-hospital programmes were necessary. For example, one county in the largely rural <span>region</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>had only one hospital. As the head of the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>regional hospital, the pre0ent of the Albany Medical Centre acknowledged a responsibility to share the hospital's resources with needy institutions. He said: 'Albany Medical Centre is the <span>region</span>' <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>s only academic health science centre. It has the responsibility to share its expertise and resources with all those who could benefit from it'. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>representative of another regional health care facility noted: 'we need to transport patient information, not the patient over telecommunications <span>links</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>. The project team worked to meet these needs through the A-Net project and visualized linking 'the LAN of one hospital to the LAN of its associate hospital thirty-eight miles away' to facilitate tele-medicine over the A-Net. The A-Net, according to this vision, would enable inter-organizational connectivity within same sector, specifically, tele-medicine. The health care facilities in remote areas needed telecommunications services, but because of the relatively small market for such services in the <span>region</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>generally, existing providers demurred on meeting this demand. The project furnished a means to aggregate the demand for  tele-medicine, thereby incentivizing the provider and potentially lowering the cost of supply. </p>

<h3>Verizon: A-Net as an inter-organizational telecommunications infrastructure</h3>

<p>Verizon designers tended to conceptualize the A-Net as a technical artefact and as a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of revenue. Verizon set the subscription <span>charges</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>high, ranging from approximately $500 a month for Gigabit Ethernet to fifteen times that for an Asynchronous Transfer Mode service. Subscribers had to pay extra for Internet access and an additional <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>management and related services. Relatively cheaper Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) was eligible for Program sub0ies and many public organizations were interested in DSL for its affordability. However, the project team did not seek DSL and Verizon was not interested in con0ering DSL. The high subscription <span>charges</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>set by Verizon discouraged non-health organizations from subscribing to the A-Net. Only health care facilities could afford the high subscription <span>charges</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> For Verizon, health care facilities <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>large <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>accounts to be courted ahead of the competition. They had always been valued clients because of their size and now they <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>a strategic opportunity field for high-end broadband services through the project. Verizon was itself a power centre. Its historical <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>local employer was further enhanced by its designation as authorized provider of programme-approved services in grantee communities. Verizon's support for the tele-medicine plan gave a power to the project team through A-Net development. The reason can be inferred from their organizational standpoint as a profit-making corporation. The Program Committee, which conducted negotiations with Verizon, said that Verizon wanted to spend money from which they would benefit. Verizon <span>attempted</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to find an inducement or a way for the A-Net project funds, which was their expenditure, to benefit them. Their proposal of proprietary <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in the first round indicated their interest in the infrastructure. Using proprietary technology, Verizon could increase control over the A-Net and could steer the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>development the way they wanted. The interviews with the regional director and manager showed that Verizon's approach in the A-Net project was infrastructure-centred. They viewed the technological infrastructure as a prerequisite for <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>outreach. Those interviewed spoke of a company goal, funding technology and learning projects in needy areas. They saw the A-Net in infrastructure terms: '<em>this project provides <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>infrastructure for up to 150 locations across a five-county <span>region</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of Central New York by providing funding for a fibre optic <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>infrastructure and digital switching <span>hardware</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>infrastructure to support an Asynchronous Transfer Mode network</em>'. Despite their sympathetic view of the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>s social goals, Verizon <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>staff were more attuned to a technical <span>rational</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>view of <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>development, which seeks to optimize outcomes on conventional <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>criteria such as <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>performance and efficiency. </p>

<h3>The subscriber groups</h3> 

<p>In 1996, the subscriber groups were thirty-two educational institutions, nine health care facilities and two cultural foundations. In general, they tended to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the A-Net as a tool (tele-medicine, distance learning and <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>portals); none had the overall vision for the A-Net that the project team possessed. Interviews with these groups further revealed that most subscribers did not know the technology specifics of the <span>network</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> nor did they appreciate the social aims of the project that the project team envisaged. Some saw the A-Net as an end in itself. Respondents stated: 'we were not interested in how technology worked, but what we really wanted was what technologies could do for us'. Many of the interviews <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the fact that the participating organizations described the A-Net as a specific technological enabler of distance learning, tele-medicine, or economic development. </p>

<h3>Technological framework: <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>among participants</h3>

<p>The project team's <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>with the subscriber groups began with the identification of their key problems, problem-solving <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and requirements for implementation of the subscriber sites. Through needs analysis via mail <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and informal inquiry, <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>identified the most needed services centred on health care and <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Yet, <span>Smith</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>s <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>regarding the A-Net was to provide health care services to Central New York State. Under the project team's leadership and coordination, two groups emerged from among the subscriber groups. One group was comprised of <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>schools, including Boards of Co-operative Educational Services, with an interest in distance learning services. As these groups had received Universal Service and E-Rate funds, they tended to see the A-Net project as an educational <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that they could use and pay for with those funds. These groups were generally lacked motivation for the project and were passive compared to the health care group, because they relied technical works on external support. These groups normally lacked technological infrastructure and resources. They had to rely on the project team's technical planning and support. The project team also needed these groups as prospective subscribers, bandwidth consumers and content providers; as such, the two (the project team and these groups) were mutually dependent. These groups, in particular, were invited as content consumers of medical services in the <span>beginning</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>schools and Boards of Co-operative Educational Services had been using the New York State Distance Learning Network, which enabled them to offer distance learning in an asynchronous and non-interactive way. They saw the A-Net as a way to offer interactive distance learning in the <span>future</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Through the demonstrations and <span>trials</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>organized by the project team, these groups <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>a sense of the <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>pedagogical capabilities of the A-Net after the successful launching of tele-medicine. These groups' technological frames were outlined and fleshed out by the project team's <span>trials</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and demonstrations of the A-Net's <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>applications capabilities. In other words, the subscriber groups' technological frames emerged from an  obscurity level to reality and the project team made the plan operationally feasible.</p>

<p>The other group was comprised of health care facilities. Their common goal was a tele-medicine. These groups generally had better technical infrastructure and technical support infrastructure than the educational groups. They generally were more proactive than the educational groups. Most health care facilities had already experimented with or started on tele-medicine delivery on their own and they brought this interest with them into the A-Net. Before the A-Net, they had been involved in <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the Adirondack Rural Health Network. They <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to use the A-Net for tele-medicine services, such as medical care, emergency care, radiological services and hospice services. With the operation of the A-Net, these groups <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to raise their current services from the the Adirondack Rural Health Network to <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>health care service. One respondent said: '<em>health care was the most needy as there were very <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>hospitals... We had some <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>around them... People wanted health care first</em>'. Another respondent stated: '<em>we did not have a hospital within fifty miles from our town</em>'. For these reasons, the project team proposed a more tele-medicine-centred infrastructure and a less distance learning-centred infrastructure. Educational institutions did not oppose the plan. Primary and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>schools and Boards of Co-operative Educational Services wanted to receive content from health care facilities, such as <span>biology</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and health-related content (e.g., hygiene, sanitary affairs). In addition, they were persuaded that, once infrastructure was in place, it would be used later for distance learning networks.</p>

<p>Between 1998-1999, the project team hosted a series of demonstrations of tele-medicine video-conferencing at the medical college, inviting thirteen superintendents of Boards of Co-operative Educational Services and twenty-two representatives from the health care facilities. Albany Medical staff sent a high-resolution X-ray from the hospital to the three Boards of Co-operative Educational Services locations, showing how the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>could be used in medical consultations. The Boards of Co-operative Educational Services representatives explored use of the A-Net for providing educational programmes for health care professionals in the sparsely populated <span>region</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> These demonstrations were <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by a three-month-long <span>trial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of these technologies <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>two selected colleges, four <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>schools and five health care facilities as participants. The <span>trials</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>were conducted in the subscriber sites with the project team's on-site technical support. During the <span>trial</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> health care professionals received <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and training over their own tele-medicine <span>equipment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> In answering a question about missing other <span>applications</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> one respondent from a clinic said: '<em>We had an <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that health care facilities take a leadership and first show how it works and then later do distance learning or other uses</em>'. After the series of demonstrations and <span>trials</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> health care facilities started to use it in their routine operations. However, the <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>sector did not have the opportunity to use this tele-medicine and the distance learning service has never been tried. </p>

<p>Toward the time of the demonstrations, Verizon organized several Regional Technical Fairs and Events. Prospective participants were invited to attend these events, where representatives from Verizon provided an overview of the eligible <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>telecommunications services and examples of tele-medicine <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and information on services pricing. Attendees felt that the events gave them a sense of Verizon's infrastructure and technologies and of the costs involved for the prospective subscribers. The events implied Verizon's implicit support for tele-medicine as a <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>application of the A-Net as well as their attitude towards the relations of other groups. The events were the only formal <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>with the project team who mediated their <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the subscriber groups. Verizon did not want to involve the A-Net, which they were obliged to support. Interaction between <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and Verizon was done through intermediation of the project team. Verizon did not want to <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>involve the subscriber groups. For example, staff from Verizon did not work <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>with the subscriber groups. Verizon's <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>with the subscriber groups was mediated by the project team because Verizon had wanted the Limited Service Offering provision. Under this provision, the project team focused on tele-medicine <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services, whereas Verizon was concerned with technical infrastructure for tele-medicine.</p>

<p>During these technology exhibitions and test-beds, however, the participation from educational communities and <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations dwindled. These participants felt: 'the tele-medicine was not something we do'. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> the high subscription fee ($750 per month plus additional incurring charges) and <span>equipment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>costs posed significant barriers for these financially constrained non-profit organizations. Expectedly, these organizations lacked technical resources. For example, most organizations did not even have technical expertise employee and therefore, they could not even propose what they wanted in the A-Net. During the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>stage, only tele-medicine application were discussed as a possible use, later tested and finally operated. The project team reported: '<em>having health care organizations as subscribers was more promising and profitable than <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations</em>'. It is inferred that the project team saw the State fund as an opportunity to start up A-Net, which they viewed as a profit making company. This was possible because the project team had a technical knowledge which the subscriber organizations (particularly non-health-care organizations) did not have. The A-Net project was operated and stabilized as a private <span>entity</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>because the project team made the subscriber organizations believe that they had been sanctioned by the State government and Verizon corroborated this <span>assumption</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> The interests of non-health care organizations were bypassed and marginalized by the coalition of the project team and Verizon and, thus, community-wide benefits were largely 0e-lined. </p>

<p>In 2001, the project team began to commercialize the A-Net services. Having realized that subscription fees alone were not enough to cover operational costs, the project team made an effort to be a financially sustainable <span>entity</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that could <span>independently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>operate. Until 2000, the A-Net's <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>financial resources had come from external funds, from federal, state government and private donations. The grant funds and the other funding for the project received at its outset as matching funds were used for <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>up the <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> In the interests of sustaining the <span>network</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> the A-Net began to build partnerships and strategic alliances with private companies, such as application service providers. It cooperated with private Web-cast and Web-service companies around the nation to create a possible new revenue <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> With this service, videocasts of relevant medical content were streamed live over the Internet to subscriber sites. These feeds could then be archived through a fee-charging database. The effort to be a private <span>entity</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by securing a new revenue stream might have been the <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>course of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for the project team. The project team started as an administrative organization for the A-Net project. As the A-Net became stabilized in its infrastructure and <span>applications</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> the project team moved away from serving local communities, but <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>other communities and ways to make services more profitable. The effort to be a commercial <span>entity</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>was contradictory by the Program Committee, who stated that the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks were to remain a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>property. </p>

<h3>Analysis of A-Net</h3>

<p>The developmental process of the A-Net shows that <span>Smith</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> as a project leader, had a developmental plan in 
the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and pursued it with the help of appropriate participants. Under his leadership, the project team undertook the steps needed to provide tele-medicine services and later to become a financially sustainable <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>once the funding ran out. Five functional sectors joined the A-Net in the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the project, but only two sectors were actively involved in the development. The project team used the <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>prototyping approach during the early stages of the project; they demonstrated technologies and <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>work settings. Through such filtering processes, the <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>sector fell away from the A-Net as they <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the A-Net would stabilize as a tele-medicine <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>The participants in the project were selected on the basis of the needs of the project team. After the <span>selection</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> the participants' interpretative flexibility and technological frames show that these were guided and facilitated by the project team. This implies that the role of the project team was system-building through mediation. The project team began with overall goals and plans for the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as a tele-medicine infrastructure. The A-Net's project team had the goal of building an intra-sectoral infrastructure. As shown, the formation of the subscriber groups was pushed by the project team. The project team approached the subscriber groups to participate, not <em>vice versa</em>. In selecting the subscribers, the project team mainly brought in subscriber groups whose interests were likely to fit their goals and whose role would contribute to their plan. The project team drew on health care facilities and educational institutions because they proposed tele-medicine and distance learning services. These organizations could contribute as providers and consumers of those services; therefore, they were selected to build and operate the <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> The A-Net's project team did not include small <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>because the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>was not <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to offer relevant services because of the <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>low demands. </p>

<p>The subscriber groups looked to the project team for leadership in <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>design. Therefore, from the <span>beginning</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> a subordinate relationship seems to have existed between the project team and the subscriber groups. To a large extent, subscribers' <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the networks were shaped by the project team. The selected subscribers may be grouped under two categories: those with ongoing projects who had clear goals, which they tried to achieve through the project and those with very little idea of what they wanted to achieve. The health care facilities in the Adirondack area <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>into the former category, the <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>sector; the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>groups and economic groups <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>into the latter. Many health care facilities had experimented with tele-medicine projects and they saw the A-Net project as an <span>extension</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the previous projects. Health care facilities in the Adirondack area were developing <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>tele-medicine <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and the proposed A-Net matched their existing interests well. The <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations and economic development groups, on the other hand, had no ongoing efforts that related to the project. The educational sector had a distance learning application in mind, but they did not have clear idea or plan of distance learning application. The gap between these two categories began to grow wider as the project received the Program funds. The former groups wanted to integrate the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>into their existing projects. The <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>between the project team and these groups were analogous to those between customers and providers. Because the hospitals in the A-Net wanted to connect to remote clinics, they <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the project team to supply necessary support. </p> 

<p>On the other hand, groups in the second category became marginal to the project because they could find little of relevance to their interests. The <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>between these groups and the project team were analogous to those between onlookers and actors, <span>respectively</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> These groups did not enthusiastically pursue participation further because some <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>interest, lacked funds, or <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>staff. The project team played a key role in interfacing between Verizon designers and these prospective subscriber groups and between content providers and content consumers among the latter. More specifically, the project team's role may be likened to that of a gatekeeper. The <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>educational and health care groups' interpretation of the A-Net as a vehicle for distance learning and tele-medicine <span>applications</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>respectively</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> was shaped by the project team's presenting the A-Net in such terms to these groups. To the health care groups, the project team framed the A-Net in terms of tele-medicine <span>applications</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> To the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>groups, they framed it as distance learning. To content providers among the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>schools, the team highlighted the A-Net's technological capabilities as a <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>platform to deliver multi-media content. To content consumers, they presented the A-Net as a cost-effective way to access content. To the technology vendors, who were interested in providing <span>equipment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and technology consulting services to the A-Net project, the project team showed opportunities to sell their products. These different groups' <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the A-Net were shaped in a decisive way by the project team. These different groups saw the project team in different ways as a mediator. Health care providers saw them as a telecommunications services provider to connect them to remote locations and connect them to customers. The <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>schools saw them as an enabler of distance learning <span>applications</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations saw them as a public Internet service provider, offering Internet service to public institutions at a lower rate. Organizations lacking technical support infrastructure saw the project team as a technical staff. Technology vendors saw them as a sales agent. Content consumers saw the project team as a content deliverer. The Program Committee saw the project team as a local field supervisor or coordinator. Verizon saw the project team as an application developer and sub-contractor of the Program Committee. In all, the development of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>was based on a 'module manufacturing' in a large technology project, where each module is developed by different groups who were coordinated by the project team. In <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>with the idea of module manufacturing, <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>said: '<em>we thought that our project A-Net as a franchise of the Program. We <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>each franchised local project could be developed a bunch of different 
<span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>people</em>'. </p>

<p>As <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>noted, the project team's intermediary role was critical in coordinating these different groups. The team knew the participants involved from similar, previous projects. This shared experience enabled the team to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the A-Net in terms of these projects and transition smoothly from these to the A-Net. Also, the team's technical expertise enabled them to work harmoniously with Verizon and technology vendors. <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>said: '<em>a bunch of technology wizards can get together and do anything, but what makes this important was coordinating those people</em>'. The project team was composed of staff who conducted well-rounded tasks with all participants. <span>Smith</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>s technological frame implied that he <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the frame of the Program Committee and applied it at the local <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>level. He assessed the subscriber groups' needs and came up with a plan to deliver needed services in the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>Smith</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>s role and by <span>extension</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that of his team, may be described as that of a 'system builder' (<a href="#hug87">Hughes 1987</a>) at the local level by the role of gate-keeping. As Hughes says, a system builder has the '<em>ability to construct or to <span>force</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>unity from diversity, centralization in the face of pluralism and coherence from chaos</em>' (<a href="#hug87">Hughes 1987</a>: 52). In this role, <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and his team provided a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of services to participants; communicating with participants, scheduling meetings, training staff and related Program activities and monitoring project progress. <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>approached other groups and convinced them to join the A-Net. He met different technology experts from hospitals, colleges, Boards of Co-operative Educational Services, Verizon and various technology vendors. These actions of <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>lend support to Bijker's <a href="#bij95">(1995)</a> assertion that the formation of technological frame and that of participants are linked processes. That is, formation of participants is <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>an activity of shaping technological frame at the same time. Recall that <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>invited only <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and health care groups to the technology demonstrations. Having been invited, such groups implicitly <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>Smith</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>s technological frame and those subscribers' frames became enhanced during the <span>trials</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> </p> 

<p>The <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>show that the <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the project team framed those of the subscriber groups and decisively shaped the development of the projects. In a departure from Bijker's <a href="#bij95">(1995)</a> account, the two projects involved no significant dramatic event. In Bijker's explanation of the development of the fluorescent light bulb, while two dominant groups (bulb manufacturers and utilities companies) tried to settle their conflicts, they agreed to call existing fluorescent lighting, <em>high-level lighting</em>. There was no technical change in the existing fluorescent lighting, but the two groups simply agreed between themselves and thus new fluorescent lighting emerged literally, a new <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for lights, not from '<em>the drawing board or at the <span>laboratory</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>bench, but at the conference table</em>' (<a href="#bij95">Bijker 1995</a>: 87). In the case of the A-Net, there was no such dramatic event. This absence of controversy can be attributed to well-defined <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>master plans. The <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>development plan was pre-determined by the project team: The project team <span>wrote</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>development scenarios and invited appropriate actors. The project team unilaterally drafted the proposal for the Program and circulated it to other subscriber groups. There was little participation or input in the development of the proposal from the prospective subscriber groups or any other groups. The participating groups <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the project team's leadership and implicitly approved their control and management over the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>projects. Smooth <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>(without dramatic events or controversy) was possible because the subscriber groups generally lacked technical skills and supporting technical staff and, thus, were dependent on the project team for both. The project team had a ready-made and pre-conceived matrix to shape the A-Net. They cast appropriate participants into their own matrix. Within such a pre-determined master plan, it is not surprising that there was no controversy over the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>designs. </p> 

<h2>Theoretical implication</h2>

<p>The discrepancies between the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>here and the <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Construction of Technology theory <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that there should be modifications to that theory. The <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>support a key <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Construction of Technology point, <span>namely</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> that technology development is not given <em>a priori</em> but is driven by the interests of various social groups. However, what has been missing in the <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Construction of Technology theory is that there is not only <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>between technology and participants, but also <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>among participants: how participants are <span>formed</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> how they interact with each other, how they share knowledge with each other, how they transfer expert knowledge to lay persons and through all these together, how they <span>eventually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>come to <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>technology. An important neglected area in <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Construction of Technology is the mediating role played by participants <em>vis-&agrave;-vis</em> other participants. In the A-Net case, the project team played critical mediating <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that decisively shaped how the different participants involved viewed the project. </p>

<p>This intermediation concept is particularly important when <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Construction of Technology is applied to <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>information technologies, particularly complex <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> which normally comprise multiple layers of technologies and various functional groups like these involved in health care and <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Bijker rarely apply his theory to <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>information technologies and other social constructivist researchers rarely do. Therefore, in the case of <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>information and communication technologies, <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Construction of Technology may incorporate other concepts. In the case of <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>information and communication technologies, not all relevant social groups may <span>possess</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the technical knowledge to be effective participants in <span>design</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> As more <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>technologies are involved in technology projects and more diverse groups participate, an intermediary role becomes increasingly important. In the A-Net case, the subscriber groups needed such intermediation to be able to participate because of the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of technical expertise. </p>

<p>The participants in general saw the networks in a particular way: as technical <span>tools</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> as ends-in-themselves, as content, or as <span>applications</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Different participants rarely interacted among themselves; <span>instead</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> the project team in this case served as bridges between the different participants facilitating their communication with each other. Unlike Bjiker's <a href="#bij95">(1995)</a> descriptions, these people's <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>were minimal, not more than attending meetings, engaging in end-user participation and entrepreneurship and being consumers of services. Only the project team had overall master plans for the project. Technical terms, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode, frame-relay and T-1 were meaningless to the subscriber groups who were mostly end-users and did not have enough technical knowledge. The project team revealed some aspects of the technology to the participants and the participants' view of the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>was coloured by how the project team presented it to them. The project team conducted a series of demonstrations and <span>trials</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as a way to introduce the technology and after the project team had explained the social and technical <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of networks, the subscriber groups could see the A-Net as exclusively a tele-medicine tool. This was a closure, a taken-for-granted technology for the subscribers' goals. Just as technology was a <em>black box</em> to the subscriber groups, so was developing <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the designers. The project team functioned like gatekeepers who illustrated each player's individual <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and pulled them together in the end. </p>

<p>Without the intermediary role of the project team, the subscriber groups would not have existed. The project team chose them as participants and had them interact with each other in specific ways. The subscriber groups of the A-Net <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the project team as 'routers' and 'in-betweens' and Verizon described the project team as 'gateways', 'channels' and 'conduits'. Commonly, the subscriber groups said that they did not know how to interact and how their concerted <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>could contribute to the networks until the project team directed them. Just as the participants at <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>levels were mediated by the project team, so were the participants at the strategic level. The Program Committee, at a high strategic level, had ideal visions of the networks (e.g., social capital and community-driven development), but it was the project team who enabled the networks to take <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>shape at the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>grassroots level. They brought infrastructure to communities and had them developed and applied. The networks did not come out of nothing, but developed from an existing technological and social infrastructure. They were agents, initiators and intermediaries. </p>

<h2>Implication for <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>studies</h2>

<p>The <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>demonstrates that the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>project's social <span>dynamics</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>resulted in certain technological forms. The <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>had been largely deviating from the initial guidelines of the Program. The initial <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the networks that the Program envisaged were that networks could be owned and operated by and for low income and under-served communities. Following the Program's guideline, the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in the study was <span>supposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>address local ownership, local audiences and local content. The most basic of these goals was <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>development from which other goals, such as 'universal' access to information, increased <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>participation, open communication, strong democracy, <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>outreach and improved <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>could evolve.</p>

<p>In the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the project time <span>period</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>seemed to follow the Program's guidelines, including economically disadvantaged organizations within the area-code <span>regions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and providing services that were most needed. Soon later the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>projects expanded their service areas from the initial areas to state, national and even global areas. Despite their <span>expansion</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> the project still remains narrowly embedded; its service sectors remain those that the project team thought 'profitable' for the networks. Their actions were not based on community-wide participation. Their recent profit-making services raise a question of whether their projects still can be seen as public networks of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networking efforts that the Committee had hoped for. The <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>managed to <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>away from being managed by local communities at large, to being managed by only a few people who were awarded authoritative <span>powers</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> In this light, the Program's frame of 'community management of <span>network</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> turned out to be unrealistic. How can communities at large manage <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks? In reality, the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks have to be operated by specialized experts. The present study shows that those experts must not only have technical and functional knowledge, but must also be capable of intermediating different groups. The Program Committee should have been concerned with more about the specific methods by which more sectors could participate and less with the <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or ownership of the networks. </p>

<p>This study suggests a more fundamental question to be answered by <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>investigation: What is a democratising method for <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>development? Current public technology developments like digital cities, electronic governments, virtual communities, e-democracy platforms, or National Information Infrastructure involve public interests and are still evolving. Because public interests are at stake, the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>developmental process and decision making about <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks should be based on a democratising method. There are many cases of technology development for public utilities, where users' subscriptions are low, with the result that those communities have suffered substantial financial losses (see, for example, Shin <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#shi06">2006</a>); Venkatesh and Shin (<a href="#ven02">2002</a>)). To avoid such undesired situations, <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>users must be heavily involved much earlier in the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>process, for example, during the initiation stage. In the A-Net case, the project team chose the subscriber groups involved in the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>stage, assigning each role, etc. However, those groups only minimally <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>decisions. The project team almost drove the projects by their own plans without the broad consensus of their communities. During the initiation stage, the project team had already set up a plan of projects, which in turn structured the <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>participation of the subscribers. In this light, the project team were 'gatekeepers' who selectively chose subscribers and only selectively showed them certain pictures out of the whole Program. The <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of this study imply that the weak participants also have a role to play in the development of technology. Even if this role consists of a mere <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of whether they subscribe to <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks or not, these actors must be involved at a much earlier stage in the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>process because they are part of the fabric of networks, regardless of their subscriptions. Those weak participants will continue to exist in <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>development projects and will continue to be problematic if they are excluded.</p>

<p>This study suggests three aspects of a  new <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks. First, there should be more support for the <em>grass-roots</em> of the networks, in the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>  Although the Program Committee tried to avoid a top-down approach, the approach adopted <span>eventually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>endowed the project leaders with supreme <span>powers</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> In <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>public technology projects, authorities have to specify certain provisions to make sure grass root development along its developmental process. The analysis implied the importance of plans and of people's orientations in public technology deployment. Demonstrations (workshop, seminar, etc.) and <span>trials</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>can be <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>procedures in reducing knowledge barriers by eliciting the plans from leaders and orienting the technology planning, communication and <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>processes based on a con0eration of what people can do with the technology and what they already have in their own sites. </p> 

<p> Second, this study suggests a participatory <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>method in which designers deploy prototypes to collect feedback and refine <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to fit the <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>s needs. Developing <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks is unique compared to <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>technology designs, because of its community-oriented approach. Stakeholder involvement should be high, with a diverse pool of voices influencing how the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is <span>designed</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> The development of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks should heavily involve social processes by active and ongoing <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>participation and its technologies should be reconstructed by such social processes. The development of <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks should start by mobilising the social forces surrounding the process. Community networks have had a tradition of participation, of being built by and for the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> This tradition should continue to the next generation of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks. In building <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks, technological functions and rationales need to be expressed in language that all the participants can understand (<a href="#ven02">Venkatesh and Shin 2005</a>). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>contextual <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>should be taken into account in all the stage of the development. Policy makers should seriously <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>adopting a context-aware <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in the <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks. Lack of general and contextualized understandings in the planning and <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of computing can lead to intrusive technology and an over-emphasis on infrastructure. </p>

<p> Third, this study suggests a way of conducting field experiments from a <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>perspective. This study suggests a Constructive Technology Assessment as an alternative approach in the development of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks. This is an attempt to broaden the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of new technologies through the feedback of technology assessment activities into the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>construction of technology (<a href="#hei05">Heiskanen <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>). It is a shift of the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of technology <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>away from assessing fully articulated technologies and introduces anticipation of technology impacts at an early stage in the development. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Constructive Technology Assessment has three features: socio-technical <span>mapping</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> which combines the stakeholder analysis of traditional technology assessment with the systematic plotting of recent technical dynamics; early and <span>controlled</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>experimentation, through which unanticipated impacts can be identified and, if needed, ameliorated; and dialogue between innovators and the public, to articulate the demand 0e of technology development. The key to these techniques is letting societal aspects become additional <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>criteria (<a href="#por97">Porte 1997</a>). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Constructive Technology Assessment can use the concept of real-time technology assessment (<a href="#gus02">Guston and Sarewitz 2002</a>) to <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the social process in developing <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>networks. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>real-time technology assessment can inform and support public participation and it can provide an explicit means for observing, criticizing and influencing social <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as they become embedded in developments. Its timely communication and early warning component helps assure awareness about <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>among designers and the public and its technology assessment and <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>component <span>produces</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>mechanism</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for such awareness to be reflexively incorporated into development. </p>

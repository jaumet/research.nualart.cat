<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Internet has inspired <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>policies encouraging autonomous learning from authentic, real-world information sources. It has opened access to a wealth of information sources for teachers to use in support of <span>textbooks</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> It has also enabled learners to seek information in breadth and depth, <span>impossible</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the traditional <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>environment providing local information resources only. The potential of the Internet to facilitate the <span>novel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>pedagogical theories emphasizing learners' active role in knowledge construction has been acknowledged. (<a href="#ale05">Alexandersson and Limberg 2005</a>; <a href="#amb99">Ambikapathi 1999</a>; <a href="#ams97">Amstutz and Whitson 1997</a>; <a href="#bra03">Branch 2003</a>; <a href="#hin03">Hinchliffe 2003</a>; <a href="#moo02">Moore 2002</a> and <a href="#sch06">Schofield 2006</a>.)</p> 

<p>The developments in the ways of accessing and manipulating information have challenged teachers to address how <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>evaluate information on the Internet and to ensure they use information <span>properly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#bra03">Branch 2003</a>; <a href="#chi07">Childs <i>et al.</i> 2007</a>; <a href="#hin03">Hinchliffe 2003</a>; <a href="#moo02">Moore 2002</a>). Educational policies typically have taken for granted teachers' ability to integrate the Internet into information literacy instruction and
lesson planning (<a href="#ams97">Amstutz and Whitson 1997</a>; <a href="#hin03">Hinchliffe 2003</a>; <a href="#moo02">Moore 2002</a>). Researchers emphasizing the fundamental change of the information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>argue that teachers have not adequately responded to or even fully grasped the meaning of the transformation of the information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Practicing teachers have tended to be more comfortable in using the old technologies they grew up with <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the new ones and have <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to utilize the Internet to its full potential in their <span>teaching</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> (<a href="#ale05">Alexandersson and Limberg 2005</a>; <a href="#ams97">Amstutz and Whitson 1997</a>; <a href="#chi07">Childs <i>et al.</i> 2007</a>; <a href="#lan03">Lankshear and Knobel 2003</a>; <a href="#moo02">Moore 2002</a> and <a href="#sch06">Schofield 2006</a>.)</p> 

<p>Limberg <i>et al.</i> (2002) point out that teachers tend to <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the Internet as a <span>textbook</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> which <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>use to find the right answers to teachers' questions <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of comparing sources of varying <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>different perspectives on issues. Many teachers underestimate the uncertainties involved in information seeking, assign learning tasks that are too demanding, <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>definite <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in information seeking instruction and <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that information literacy is learned by doing without explicit instruction (<a href="#ams97">Amstutz and Whitson 1997</a>; <a href="#lim02">Limberg <i>et al.</i> 2002</a>; <a href="#moo02">Moore 2002</a>). There is even some evidence indicating that teachers demonstrate much of the same impoverished information behaviour and struggle with the same issues as their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>do (<a href="#moo02">Moore 2002</a>).</p> 

<p>Novice teachers enter the profession with preconceptions or experiences of <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> learning and information seeking, which influence their understanding of information literacy <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#bru06">Bruce <i>et al.</i> 2006</a>; <a href="#joh94">John 1994</a>; <a href="#van99">van der Valk and Broekman 1999</a>). The novices are yet to develop professional <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#joh91">John 1991</a>; <a href="#mad05">Madden <i>et al.</i> 2005</a>), but there is the promise that once exposed to the Internet and the <span>novel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>pedagogical theories in training they would be more likely to show the 'in0er mindset' with regards to the Internet than their predecessors (see <a href="#lan03">Lankshear and Knobel 2003</a>: 32-33, 59-64; <a href="#mad05">Madden <i>et al.</i> 2005</a>). The new generation of teacher trainees might have grown up in the new information <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> but little research is available on their <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in information seeking and use, the clarity of their conceptions in these issues, and their ability to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on their own information behaviour (see <a href="#bra03">Branch 2003</a>).</p>

<p>The overall goal of our project is (1) to develop digital portfolios and mobile <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as means to foster teacher trainees' reflective learning and (2), to study teacher trainees' understanding of their information behaviour in lesson planning as an indicator of their proficiency as information literacy instructors. This paper focuses on the second sub-goal. We co-operate with the <a href="http://www.uta.fi/laitokset/okl/tokl/english/index.php">Unit for Pedagogical Studies in Subject Teacher Education</a> at the University of Tampere. Their basic educational idea is that teachers' professional skills develop from experience, in reflection with <span>novel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>pedagogical theories, into didactic theories applicable in practice. In the academic year of 2006-2007 digital portfolios and mobile <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as facilitators of the teacher trainees' reflective learning activities and to mediate dialogue between the trainees. Each trainee planned and delivered training <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>under the supervision of teacher educators and a tutoring teacher. Lesson planning in subject teacher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>offered a chance to address teacher trainees' information behaviour in a relevant and authentic context.</p> 

<p>This paper reports the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the pilot stage of the project. The goal was to elaborate lesson planning as a task context of the teacher trainees' information behaviour and to develop research questions, data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and analysis methods for the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>study. We concentrated on the following research tasks in the pilot.</p>

<ul>
<li>How do teacher trainees seek and use information for lesson plans?</li>
<li>What do teacher trainees learn about seeking and using information for lesson plans?</li>
</ul>

<p>The paper begins with a review of previous research conducted on lesson planning and teacher trainees' information behaviour. Then, we outline a conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for the analysis of teacher trainees' information behaviour in lesson planning, specify the research questions and elaborate the data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and analysis methods. Then, we describe the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>results of the pilot study. And finally, we <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the results to develop a basis for further research.</p>

<h2>Related research</h2>

<p>Research on lesson planning shows that teachers plan lessons (in advance) to cope with time constraints, prioritize subject content, assess learning outcomes, and anticipate classroom events. Lesson plans are written guides with varying <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of structure and detail. Lesson planning involves teachers in interpreting and transforming a significant <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information to specify learning exercises, schedules, <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning resources, means to control the class, and learning objectives. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>exercise <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>students to complete a worksheet or to prepare a <span>presentation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> The Internet is sometimes used in exercises to improve <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> interest and motivation, promote active learning and freedom of <span>choice</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> allow <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to work more <span>independently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with content (e.g., receive feedback from Websites), and provide current, first-hand materials with greater level of detail than <span>textbooks</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Researchers have found that teacher trainees' lesson planning <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>develop through their training <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as a result of influences from subject content, knowledge of pupils' <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and needs, classroom experiences, personality, method tutors and mentors in <span>schools</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and <span>schools</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the teacher's role.

<p>Madden <i>et al.</i> (<a href="#mad05">2005</a>) surveyed practicing teachers' views of the Internet as an educational resource. Most teachers found the Internet a valuable <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information that could make an important contribution to <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>if it were only used to its full potential. Particularly young teachers, who had more experience of using the Internet, were confident in their ability to use the Internet and found <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>services easy to use. The teachers who perceived information overload due to the number of sites that <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to them had typically the least experience of using the Internet.

(<a href="#mad05">Madden <i>et al.</i> 2005</a>.)</p>

<p>Branch (<a href="#bra03">2003</a>) studied how a resource-based <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>course <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>teacher trainees' understandings of information literacy. Early in the course the teacher trainees con0ered <span>finding</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> locating and acquiring information as aspects of information literacy. Towards the end of the course terms indicating processing, <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and organization of information had entered in the trainees' <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information literacy. Few trainees con0ered information use, assessing the credibility of information, or understanding differences in information sources as aspects of information literacy. Some trainees reported that they needed to be information literate as teachers to be able to find information to supply <span>textbooks</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and choose the right method to teach a particular subject. However, the trainees gave few indications regarding helping their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to be information literate. The trainees perceived learning during the course to identify information needs and to think critically which resources would meet their needs the best, and to locate, access and evaluate information found on the Internet. Branch concludes that the teacher trainee <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>programme seemed to teach information literacy for the trainees, but <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to provide them with the skills of how to teach information literacy to their <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> (<a href="#bra03">Branch 2003</a>.)</p> 

<h2>Core concepts and research methods</h2>

<p>Information behaviour is commonly used as an umbrella concept for the broad <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information related human actions such as seeking and using (<a href="#wil99">Wilson 1999</a>). Marchionini (<a href="#mar95">1995</a>) defines information seeking as the overall <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information through various information channels and information searching as the use of a specific channel providing the access to information sources. Bystr&ouml;m and J&auml;rvelin (<a href="#bys95">1995</a>) <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>between the information channel, which guides users to information sources, and the information <span>source</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> which contains the information. So, based on the definition, the Web, a library and a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are channels; an Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) file, a Web page, a book, a newspaper, and a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>offering a <span>straight</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>answer are (types of) sources.</p>

<p>The information seeker's <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the relationship between an information problem and an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is relevance. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>broad body of literature representing wide <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in research methods, user groups and information environments attests that the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of criteria applied in relevance assessments is <span>finite</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Differences in the criteria across studies may <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>information seekers' responses to situational influences such as task requirements, the information <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and the information problem. (<a href="#bar98">Barry and Schamber 1998</a>.)</p>

<p>Researchers have outlined the dimensions or types of information use in various ways. Kari (<a href="#kar07">2007</a>) emphasizes the distinction between (1) using (i.e., interacting with) information sources, (2) making sense of retrieved information (to become informed), and (3) the ways in which gained knowledge is applied in <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(after it has been made sense of). It is also <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>both <span>mental</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and physical dimensions of information use, which are manifested in decision making or problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with information (i.e., thinking) and informing others (i.e., communicating), even if one dimension can be more prevalent. (<a href="#kar07">Kari 2007</a>.) Alexandersson and Limberg (<a href="#ale03">2003</a>) have proposed a typology (1) transporting (i.e., copying and pasting), (2) transforming (i.e., paraphrasing the information source) and (3) reformulating (i.e., completely rewriting the information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>own words), which elaborates the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information use with respect to information sources.</p>

<p>The two research tasks presented earlier were elaborated as the following research questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Which information channels and sources do teacher trainees access and utilize when seeking information for lesson plans?</li>
<li>What criteria do teacher trainees apply when selecting information for use in lesson planning?</li>
<li>What patterns can be identified in teacher trainees' information seeking in lesson planning?</li>
<li>For what <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>do teacher trainees use information in lesson planning?</li>
<li>What do teacher trainees learn about seeking and using information for lesson plans?</li>
</ol>

<p>The research questions were transformed into <a href="#appendix1">an interview guide</a>, which granted the researcher the freedom to rephrase questions if requested and the interviewees to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the questions in their own way. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>teacher educator co-operating with the research project was consulted and his group of fourteen prospective history teachers, both male and female, was recruited for individual interviews at the end of their training <span>period</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> The interviews were carried out in April 16-27th, 2007 and resulted in approximately six hours of audio data. The data were transcribed word-for-word, although we did not <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on linguistic or discursive <span>features</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> The quotations presented are <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>translations</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>from spoken Finnish.</p>

<p>The aim of the analysis was not to track individual differences but to describe the trainees' recollections about seeking and using information for lesson plans. <a href="http://www.atlasti.com/">Atlas.ti</a> <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>data analysis <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was used to <span>segment</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the data into <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>expressing relevant and discrete ideas or conceptions, and then, to compare and to organize the <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>into groups corresponding to the research questions. After this, a summary of the <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in each group was written. To <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the relatively unstructured nature of the interviews the <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are quantified only loosely in the text.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<h3>Information channels, sources, and <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>criteria</h3>

<p>The teacher trainees accessed information through a wide array of  channels including the Web, libraries, or on a few occasions, through mediators such as supervisors, colleagues or tutors. The Web was used either <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>from the browser's address field, from a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>service (e.g., Google), or on a few occasions, from a directory service. The university and city libraries were accessed either on the spot or from online bibliographic databases. The <span>schools</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and the trainees' own collections (i.e., bookshelves) could function as information channels albeit only in the trivial <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of providing access to <span>textbooks</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 

<p>The information sources used by the trainees comprised printed and electronic documents: <span>textbooks</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> books, magazines, newspapers, compact discs; Web sites, Adobe Acrobat files (.pdf), images and videos. The trainees searched images mainly through Google (image search). Wikipedia was a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that raised a great <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>spontaneous</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>reflection among the interviewees. On one hand, many interviewees acknowledged using it, but, on the other hand, some seemed to question or even belittle its <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as an information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 

<p>The teacher trainees' most often mentioned criteria for selecting information were topicality and (perceived) authority. The curriculum, preceding and following lessons framed topicality as the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>criterion. Impartiality (or 'objectivity') was the criteria mentioned most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with respect to Web sources. Information was perceived as being more <span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>if it was reiterated in different sources:</p>

<blockquote>If the same thing is being said on twenty Web sites, in the same way, it's quite likely to <span>hold</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>true, and I no longer care about it if I'm having a class for the upper level of comprehensive <span>school</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>.. then I don't bother going to university library. But if, for example, information in the Net is in <span>conflict</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> then it had to be verified from somewhere else. [R11]</blockquote> 

<p>The illustration exemplifies also how the effort teacher trainees put into information seeking could vary with regards to the class level.</p>

<p>Some trainees tended to think how the information might be used while selecting sources. They estimated the amount of work needed to adapt information to use in the lesson plan and con0ered its suitability with their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in mind. Other criteria, appearing infrequently in the data, were the novelty of information, the diversity of viewpoints <span>offered</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of image files, and the <span>equipment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>available in classroom.</p>

<h3>Information seeking patterns</h3>

<p>The teacher trainees stated that they often knew only a little in advance about the topics they were assigned to teach, because of the breadth of history and social studies curricula. The trainees' subject knowledge greatly <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>their information behaviour:</p>

<blockquote>If I was really <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with a <span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>.. then you knew what to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and what you wanted to talk through in that lesson, but if the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was really, really peculiar, er then... seeking information was in a way a part of that you were learning that <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by yourself. And once you got to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>more into it, er [the topic] maybe changed, that things that you had thought to use in it were left out and other things were taken in. [R12]</blockquote> 

<p>Many trainees described a similar <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the specificity of <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>goals. One, for example, had searched the Web for the number of deceased Finns in the Continuation War (between Finland and the USSR, 1941-1944) and, in contrast, information on the (European) Explorers to decide to which ones to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on. Another trainee illustrated how the subject could influence information seeking:</p>

[R2]</blockquote>

<p>Most trainees read the <span>textbook</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>first to get acquainted with the <span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> One trainee explained that he <span>wrote</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>lists of <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>themes based on the <span>textbook</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> compared different series of authorized <span>textbooks</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and then modified the <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>themes recurrently occurring in the literature. Based on the <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>textbooks</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the trainees made the decision to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for more information or get on with the information they already had. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>trainee illustrated how <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>textbooks</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>constituted the <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for information searching on the Web:</p>

<blockquote>I usually went to Google and then put [there] some <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>words that I knew of - or had found with the help of that book's chapter - like, those <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>issues that should be searched [on the topic]. [R4]</blockquote>

<p>The Web would be used to explore the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>if, for example, a <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was only briefly discussed in <span>textbooks</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> but this was found to be laborious. One trainee complained of spending five hours browsing the Web to familiarize herself with labour market organizations. The trainees, when they were aware of useful resources, accessed them <span>straight</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>from browsers' address fields, but simple <i>googling</i> prevailed when the nature of the problem preferred it.</p>

<h3>Information use</h3>

<p>The teacher trainees used retrieved information in lesson plans to complement <span>textbooks</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> exemplify, illustrate, <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>interest, or raise discussion. They distributed handouts or photocopies to <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or presented images with a projector or a document camera. The trainees often assigned learning activities as a substitute for giving <span>lectures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to keep <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>interested in the subject content. So, as a trainee put it, after acquainting herself with the <span>topic</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> she started thinking what kind of activities she would use. One trainee told of seeking ready-made exercises or information that could be used in making exercises, at this point.</p>

<p>The trainees thought carefully about how to present information to students:</p>

<blockquote>It is pretty challenging after all, that if you think about transforming information meant to adults for seventh graders. And there is, that even if the information was theirs to chew up, then what is the way I present it to them? [R6]</blockquote> 

<p>One trainee compared different <span>textbooks</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for cues of how to present issues in a way understandable by <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>trainee explained how he would plan to present information:</p>

<blockquote>I usually tried to start from a question, which relates to a detail in a picture. <span>Sometimes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>[I started] from that OK, anyone happens to know whom does the picture portray? But usually it started from, or the purpose was that it would have started from <span>details</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> that what is the difference between these two characters... And then you in a way guide the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to see meaningful elements in pictures such as these, give meanings to them, <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and guide them into that interpretation. [R11]</blockquote>

<p>A trainee explained when asked, what <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>she did with information when using it:</p>

<blockquote>Usually I simplify it... or mix information from a number of sources or transform that information into exercises, but... if I find an article or else from the Net - well sometimes I have shown <span>straight</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>.. that articles found from newspapers of course <span>straight</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>- but usually all information from the Net has to be processed, that seldom you can just print let's say a five page article, that 'let's read from this', so you must do something for it. [R2]</blockquote>

<p>When processing information the trainees either chose only the parts of <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>they perceived their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>would comprehend, simplified the <span>vocabulary</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>used in the originals, reduced and <span>synthesized</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>information. Only images were, or could be, used without processing the originals.</p>

<h3>Perceived learning outcomes</h3>

<p>Many trainees perceived <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in assessing information sources and often <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>their way when searching for information on the Web. The trainees' reflections on learning outcomes were to a great extent characterized by experiences of coping with information overload. Some trainees just grew to use <span>textbooks</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>when familiarizing themselves with the general <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and avoided using the Web except for specific searches. The trainees perceived they became better at filtering information. Some noticed that they did not have to master the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>thoroughly to be able to teach it, because they could estimate what would be enough, based on the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> age and comprehension and thus save themselves the extra work. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>trainee explained that she had learned to make it clear to herself what the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is about and only then <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the information she perceived she would need.</p>

<p>Finding the appropriate means to present information in the <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>time frame and in a way maintaining <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> interest was another <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>issue characterizing the trainees' reflections on learning outcomes. Many trainees found exercises to be a viable alternative to lecturing. One trainee stressed the importance of presenting information in an organized manner:</p>

<blockquote>No one learns from a <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of trivia, but if [the content] is organized thematically, chronologically or otherwise, one might remember something about it. [R11]</blockquote>

<p>Another explained his conception of historical knowledge:</p>

<blockquote>Teaching history is largely about <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>facts... there are certain historical facts, that must be presented to <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in proper proportions or the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves [have to] work on something wherein [they become familiarized with these facts]... But of course information searching, if you think about it, should be taught to <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> so it is important to be aware of how your own information searching or how you should <span>search</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>.. so that the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>too will not go to Google first. [R5]</blockquote>

<p>This trainee was the only one to bring up <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>information seeking or searching in subject <span>teaching</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>Conclusion and discussion</h2>

<p>The pilot study gave us an overall picture of teacher trainees' information behaviour in lesson planning. Most of the trainees were fluent users of Web resources and can be called in0ers in this respect. The teacher trainees accessed information through a diverse set of channels and utilized various types of sources. They applied various information seeking <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>based on their subject knowledge and the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for which they <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to use information. The trainees learned ways of coping with information overload. They were able to locate and retrieve relevant information from the Internet and use information in different media in support of <span>textbooks</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> The trainees were concerned about the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information retrieved from the Internet. They selected and presented information with their <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> age and comprehension in mind. These results <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>relevant information was not a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>problem for the trainees.</p>

<p>The issues of interest emerging from the data are how teacher trainees</p>

<ul>
<li>coped with information overload by filtering and avoiding information;</li> 
<li>determined when they had done enough (information seeking);</li>
<li>presented information in a way that their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>could comprehend;</li>
<li>perceived the usability of information on the basis of their <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> comprehension;</li>
<li>used their assessment of the usability of information as a <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>criterion during information seeking (indicating why seemingly relevant information sources are not selected for use); and</li>
<li>do not seem to adopt <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>information seeking skills as a part of their role as subject teachers.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>suggest that the prospective history teachers' ways of seeking and using information are in <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with the standards defined in information literacy initiatives such as the <a href="http://www.anziil.org/resources/Info%20lit%202nd%20edition.pdf">Australian and New Zealand Information Literacy Framework</a> and the <a href="http://www.lita.org/ala/mgrps/divs/acrl/standards/standards.pdf">Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education</a>. The trainees' methods may not have been the most efficient but they were able to get the work done. We are aware that history majors, extensively trained in independent information seeking through traditional information channels (e.g., libraries and archives) and the Internet, might not be representative of teacher trainees in general. For the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>study, we organized another group comprising trainees in subjects other than history to collect a more diverse <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>Our <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>relate to those of Branch (<a href="#bra03">2003</a>) as similar issues seemed to characterize teacher trainees' information behaviour in both studies. We also find that the studied teacher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>programmes do not encourage teacher trainees to instruct <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in information seeking and use. In both studies few teacher trainees gave indications of being aware of the importance of helping their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to become information literate; however, we refrain from making strong conclusions at this point since the pilot study was not <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to assess the teacher trainees' information literacy. It is debatable, of course, whether the history teacher trainees possessed the high order thinking skills, that are set in the information literacy standards as a requirement for reflective information behaviour. It is also possible that the interviews did not give the trainees the necessary trigger or the chance to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on their views on (teaching) information literacy. Neither were information seeking and use <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as specific goals in the portfolio activities nor in teacher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in general. Hence, it is possible that, while having the skills associated with information literate behaviour, the trainees might not have been prepared to <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>these issues.</p>

<p>We identified two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>shortcomings in the way data collectection was implemented in this study. First, the interview questions involved abstractions, which the researcher had to concretize for the interviewees. As the questions were not (re)phrased in <span>identical</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>manner, the interviews became less formal than initially planned. Second, the interviews took place several weeks after the training <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>had taken place, because the project was launched too <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the academic year. Hence, the trainees were not able to recall their lesson planning efforts in the detail assumed when the interview guide was <span>designed</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> When collecting data for the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>study we know better what to expect from the trainees and will organize the interviews as soon as possible after the <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are <span>held</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

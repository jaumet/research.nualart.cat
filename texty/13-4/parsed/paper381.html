<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Research conferences are information-intensive sites of activity and an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>component in the professional practice of academics, research <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and practitioners in any field. Such conferences enable the convergence of and interplay between formal and informal communication channels as well as mediated and personal information exchanges. Taking part in a conference like the biennial Information Seeking in Context conferences (ISIC), for instance, can be framed as both a research and an information practice. As a site of information practice, the conference can be examined in terms of participants' purposive information seeking, incidental or serendipitous encounters with information and formal and informal information exchanges. As a site of research practice, the conference can be examined in terms of its contribution to learning, scholarly communication and engaging with research and researchers in the field. The <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>discussed in this paper are <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>from a project merging exploration of these two <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>within the ISIC <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> As one of the participants in the ISIC 2006 conference in Sydney reported, ISIC conferences are the '<em>…primary learning arena for [me]: keeping informed of current research, collegial exchange of ideas</em>' (Phil  (respondents are assigned a pseudonym)).  In <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the question What does ISIC mean to you?, he remarked that ISIC is the '<em>primary <span>mechanism</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for engaging with key researchers in the information behaviour field.</em>' Conference activity is an information behaviour, which, as Phil's remarks illustrate, is a critical component of being a researcher or practitioner in the field. The overlap of the formal and the informal aspects of social <span>interactions</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> knowledge production and information gathering that are part of scholarly communication practice are particularly evident at a conference. As such, conferences provide an opportunity to study the interconnections between and within these <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> </p> 

<p>Our paper explores the specific identity of ISIC 2006 within the context of the wider ISIC series. It examines the topics that (according to the informants in our project) seemed to bring people to the conference. We are interested here in exploring the appeal and the practice that revealed itself at ISIC 2006. We are also interested in the trajectories arising from earlier conferences in the ISIC series that might be con0ered <em>core business</em> for ISIC. This is, in our view, the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of a historical exploration of the practice of research within the ISIC <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Looking at what has been presented at the conferences since the first event in 1996 helps us to form a picture of the information about the field on offer. What is the thematic landscape in which attendees <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>at an ISIC conference? How do the day-to-day choices of conference participants interact with that landscape? What makes ISIC <em>ISIC</em> for attendees?</p>


<h2>Project background and related literature</h2>

<p>Conferences renew, inform and inspire us. They expose us to the latest research and provide the networking opportunities that connect us to professional colleagues and friends. The project from which the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in this paper are reported explores the information and communication exchanges at a research conference and the role they play in academic work <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> The project is part of our ongoing exploration of research as a scholarly practice and the practice of research. Conferences provide forums for many concurrent social and academic activities. Our goal is to explore the rhythms of ISIC across the conference series as well as the rhythms present in the <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>activity <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>place at a particular ISIC. The project was also envisaged as a way of creating a research narrative depicting the evolution of the conference since the first ISIC in 1996 and its contribution to developments in information behaviour research. The conference that took place in Sydney, Australia in July 2006 presented an opportunity to begin examining these activities within a specific <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>(information behaviour researchers).</p>

<p>At ISIC 2006, we piloted a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of techniques, which can contribute to a contextual understanding of the <span>dynamics</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of this important component of scholarly communication. After providing some background about the first phase of the project and some of the research <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>used to study conference activity at ISIC 2006, this paper <span>discusses</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the outcome of analysis from some of the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>data and what it suggests about the role that ISIC conferences play in the research and information seeking activities of the researchers and practitioners who attend them.</p>

<h3>Key themes under investigation</h3>

<p>Conference activity has long played a <span>prominent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>role in the information seeking of researchers. Olander's (<a href="#OLA2007">2007</a>) longitudinal <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>scientists, for instance, reported that '<em>carefully selected conferences and journals</em>' served as the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>strategies for monitoring <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>research area, <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that had not changed in any <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>way in the twenty years between the first and second wave of her interviews with the scientists. Digital media may have changed the way we access journals and participate in a conference. <span>Nevertheless</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> conferences remain a critical component of individual scholarship. In many ways an international research conference like ISIC is a site where all forms of scholarly communication interact: formal and informal <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge exchange, print and electronic media, grey literature and formal publications (<a href="#BOR2001">Borgman and Furner 2001</a>). </p>

<p>Research activity is information intensive; no more so than at a conference. There are several aspects of conference activity and academic life that underpin this project. This section presents key themes informing the discussion presented in this paper. </p>

<h4>Theme 1: knowledge sharing in an academic life </h4>

<p>There has been a <span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>recognition of the need to examine the information behaviour of academics in context (e.g., <a href="#ELD1993">Ellis <em>et al.</em> 1993</a>; <a href="#OCH1996">Ocholla 1996</a>; <a href="#SEL2001">Selden 2001</a>; <a href="#TAL2002">Talja 2002</a>). Meadows (<a href="#MED1990">1990</a>) and Sandstrom (<a href="#SAN2001">2001</a>) emphasise academic research as a form of social <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that academic information seeking can be viewed as a communal activity within a socio-ecological system. Researchers like Talja (<a href="#TAL2002">2002</a>) and Selden (<a href="#SEL2001">2001</a>) further build on this exploration of the social practice associated with academic work. Such knowledge sharing plays an important role within the evolution of an academic's research activity. Anderson (<a href="#ATD2006">2006</a>) found, for example, that conference attendances at timely points in a project or conversations with colleagues had noticeable impact on her informants' own research and information seeking <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The research described in this paper is part of a project that seeks to build on those <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> It also seeks to contribute to <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by Talja (<a href="#TAL2002">2002</a>) and Fry and Talja (<a href="#FRY2004">2004</a>) about social sharing in academic communities and the role of conference papers in academic work ( <a href="#DMC1995">Drott 1995</a>). In her examination of the context of academic information seeking, Talja (<a href="#TAL2002">2002</a>: 155) concludes:</p>

<blockquote>Scholars' social networks not only affect their choices of information seeking strategies; rather these networks are often the place where information is <span>sought</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> interpreted, used and created.</blockquote>

<p>At a research conference, the networks that facilitate these information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>manifest themselves in both the <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of formal papers and the informal exchanges <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>place during the course of the event.</p>

<h4>Theme 2: Informal exchanges of information</h4>

<p>This project builds on Paisley and Parker (<a href="#PAI1968">1968</a>), whose study represents one of the earliest examinations of the role of conferences (in their paper <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to as scientific conventions) in the use of information. In the opening paragraph of that paper, Paisley and Parker note that, in contrast to the '<em>substantial artifacts of an information system</em>' like books and journals: '<em>The informal exchanges of information at a convention leave no record - except in the <span>minds</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of scientists themselves</em>' (<a href="#PAI1968">Paisley and Parker 1968</a>: 65). Their work examines the '<em>scientific information flow</em>' through these informal exchanges, focusing on the way attendees at a social science convention acquire and use the information obtained there. While their study is forty years old, the questions explored continue to have relevance for a study of conference activity in our time. For this reason, one of the data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>tools for our project involved a revised version of the Paisley and Parker questionnaire. Our modifications are discussed further <a href="#resdes">
below</a>.</p>

<h4>Theme 3: Information encounters and serendipitous discoveries </h4>

<p>A further thread relates to the <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of unanticipated or unplanned encounters with people and information that a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>might experience while engaged in research. The <span>qualities</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of serendipitous and unstructured encounters with information play a critical role in the hard sciences as well as in <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>research (<a href="#FIG1996">Fine and Deegan 1996</a>; <a href="#FOR1999">Ford 1999</a>; <a href="#KON2008">Konecki 2008</a>). These <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and serendipitous encounters <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>not only in the context of engagement with information, but in encounters with colleagues. The heady mix of people and ideas within the intensive <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of a research conference affords a valuable opportunity for studying this thread. Anderson (<a href="#ATD2006">2006</a>) found that her informants used conference attendance as a way to kick-start their thinking about information gathering on particular topics as well as to stay current on the latest thinking in research areas of interest to them. Such practice <span>differs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>from deliberate information seeking, however. These connection building opportunities can <span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>simply by attending and being exposed to the ideas that are circulating at a conference.</p>

<h4>Theme 4: Intertwining research and information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in scholarly life</h4>

<p>A common <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>through all these themes is the acknowledgment that conference activity be viewed as both a research and information practice. <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>production in the university of the 21st century is increasingly seen as a highly creative, multidisciplinary undertaking. Research practice, according to Noam (<a href="#NOA1997">1997</a>) consists primarily of three elements: to create knowledge and standards; to preserve information; and to pass it on to others. It is a knowledge generation process whereby information is transformed into meaning by a researcher for further communication within a <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Every scholar is a '<em>link in the information chain</em>' (<a href="#HER2001">Herman 2001</a>: 393).  Working with information thus is critically intertwined with research work; research work is laced with behaviour we might identify as information seeking. Studying the information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of academics has to go hand in hand with studying academic work life.</p>

<p>Exploring research and information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in the fullest possible context allows us to understand the complexity and diversity involved in both information seeking and academic work. This principle motivated our approach to the data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>(discussed below). <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> as was indicated above, academic work has both strong social and individual <span>characteristics</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Both the people and information brought together at a research conference shape the experience. The aim of our project is to undertake an intense, fine-grained observation of this very complex and dynamic <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2><a id="resdes" name="resdes" />The &#8220;Day in the life of a conference &#8221; Project</h2>

<p>The project takes a <em>bricolage</em> approach (<a href="#KIN2001">Kincheloe 2001</a>; <a href="#LIN2001">Lincoln 2001</a>; <a href="#KIN2005">Kincheloe 2005</a>) using diverse ethnographic and unobtrusive techniques to locate and describe the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of activities <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>place during ISIC 2006. The field work forms the core of research narratives that follow the analytical approach reported in Anderson (<a href="#ATD2006">2006</a>).These narratives involve two streams of <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>(both of which are ongoing): one associated with collecting the stories of researchers with <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to ISIC since its beginnings in 1996 and the other associated with the activities of participants at ISIC conferences in 2006 and then in 2008.</p>

<p>Exploring the Web of relationships between conference participants and the processes by which knowledge is exchanged and research is produced <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>an emergent approach to the research <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in terms of both the gathering and the analysis of fieldwork (<a href="#DNK1989">Denzin 1989</a>; <a href="#EDA1993">Erlandson <em>et al.</em> 1993</a>)  inform our work, though the project draws on a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of methods and <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>work <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in context. The work is also informed by ethnographic principles for examining organisations and media use in relation to work (<a href="#HAR2000">Harper 2000</a>; <a href="#HIR2001">Hirsch and Gellner 2001</a>). Another key theoretical orientation involves creative <span>analytic</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>practices <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of narrative research (e.g., <a href="#CLA2000">Clandinin and Connelly 2000</a>; <a href="#RIC2000">Richardson 2000</a>).  This emergent approach is integrated with a bibliometric analysis of ISIC conference citations (<a href="#GLA2001">Gl&#228;ser and Laudel 2001</a>; <a href="#CRO2002">Cronin and Shaw 2002</a>)  to lend further support to the historical narrative crafted from the ethnographic elements of the fieldwork.</p>

<p>Two questionnaires were distributed (one before the conference, another at the conference) to help us build a composite picture of the ISIC <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and the general information behaviour of conference participants. (See <a href="#AppA">Appendices</a> for copies of these two research <span>instruments</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>) The questions in the first <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>instrument were <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to provide a better understanding of how the Conference fits into respondents' overall research work. The second <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>instrument posed conference-specific questions. The questions for both these <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>adapted and <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>Paisley and Parker's (<a href="#PAI1968">1968</a>) questionnaire, distributed at the 1966 meeting of an interdisciplinary behavioural science convention. We chose to use their questionnaire as a starting point for the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of our own as it struck us as an under-used, but appropriate, <span>instrument</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for our <span>purposes</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Their work remains <span>influential</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#BMJ2004">Bates 2004</a>) and suggests the types of <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and information behaviour that are reportable and relevant to any study of information exchanges at a conference. </p>

<p>Unlike the earlier <span>instrument</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>used by Paisley and Parker, ours was <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>into two parts, with the first part being electronically distributed to conference participants prior to the conference. In this way, responses to this first questionnaire could be used to identify key informants to involve in some of the other data gathering <span>approaches</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> These included activity diaries and critical incident interviews (<a href="#BCA1997a">Barry 1997b</a>), blogging and online <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on a dedicated Website adapting the <em>directives</em> of the autobiographical diary method (<a href="#BLA2002">Black and Crann 2002</a>), photo-voice (<a href="#WAN1997">Wang and Burris 1997</a>) and structured observations (<a href="#GON2004">Gonzalez and Mark 2004</a>). </p>

<p>The second questionnaire (distributed <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the conference) invited participants to share their impressions of ISIC 2006 with us. The date and time of each <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>was recorded so we could contextualise comments in relation to the conference programme. As with the pre-conference questionnaire, respondents had the option to remain anonymous. This two-page <span>instrument</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>adapted some of the questions from Paisley and Parker, which asked how respondents thought they might use information they heard or collected at the conference. Our <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>form <span>attempted</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to tabularise these questions in order to reduce their size in <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>with the original <span>survey</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Doing so meant responses could be collected quickly during coffee breaks and other intervals between conference sessions. The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of our <span>instrument</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> however, was a series of four open-ended questions about respondents' impressions and interests at the conference <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by four quick <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>questions that invited them to share with us impressions, interests and attention-grabbers at various points <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the conference. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>contrast to the lengthier pre-conference questionnaire, this <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>form resembled market research clipboard surveys. Our intention was to collect conference <em>sound grabs</em> that could help us build a picture of the way information circulated at the conference and its potential <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for participants. To this end, a team of research assistants wandered through the conference inviting participants to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to some of these questions orally if they chose to do so.</p>

<p>Along with data gathering techniques that <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>involved participants, unobtrusive spatial analysis techniques (<a href="#GIV2003">Given 2003</a>)  were used to <span>map</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the physical layout of conference venues and to record the ways people made use of various formal and informal <span>spaces</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>associated with the conference.</p>

<h2>Rhythms of activity at ISIC 2006</h2>

<p>In this paper we <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on our analysis on questions posed in both <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>instruments exploring what attracted attendees to the ISIC 2006 conference. The particular pre-conference <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>questions we <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>relate to the programme listed <a href="http://www.webcitation.org/5d2opfXMN"  target="_blank">on the Website</a> and to whether respondents were interested in following research in particular areas at the conference. The two questions posed in the conference <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>are: <em>What brings you to ISIC?</em> and, <em>What does ISIC mean to you?</em> We used the reasons people gave for attending the Conference and any particular areas of interest they were looking for as the starting point for our analysis.</p>

<p>In both sets of questions, respondents commented that they attended the Conference to learn about the <em>'latest research in the field'</em> and to hear from and meet with researchers and practitioners. Such comments are consistent with earlier research about the role that conference attendance plays in scholarly life. Here the intertwining of research and information activity is at its most connected: what they want or hope to find at the conference will (as many of the informants themselves said) shape what information they will pursue and what and how they will use it. Using data collected at the Conference, we <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to explore how participants were defining <em>the field</em>. The diversity of responses prompted us to examine them further and construct a grounded taxonomy of their stated research interests. To identify the information made available to conference attendees through the formal programme, we also began charting both the topics and authors of the conference presentations. Examining <em>the field</em>  in terms of both <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>respondents and the Conference programme series  helped us to develop a fuller picture of the information landscape, which participants find themselves in at an ISIC conference. </p>

<h2>What is the ISIC landscape?</h2>

<p>Examining the ISIC landscape began with the collation of all papers presented at ISIC conferences from the first in 1996, through to the most recent in 2006. Two hundred and ten papers were presented at these conferences. Both authors <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and conference paper titles were collected from all conferences as well as keywords from the 2004 and 2006 conference papers found in the metadata of issues of the <em>Information Research</em> journal in which these papers were published. </p>

<h3>Mapping conference topics</h3>

<p>To complete a keyword <span>mapping</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>across all conferences, keywords were extracted from the titles of papers presented at conferences from 1996 to 2002 as no publication metadata keywords are available for these earlier conferences. Title and keyword <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>were used to <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as much as possible the <span>representations</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the papers as they were presented by their authors. For the 1996 to 2002 conferences minimal interpretation was <span>attempted</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in the identification of keywords. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of author-provided keywords for the 2004 and 2006 conference papers suggested that for the most part authors were using similar <span>terminology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>within the two forms of <span>representation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> However it was evident in this analysis that author-provided keywords did tend to include a higher instance of broader categorisations for their own work, for example more instances of terms such as <em>information behaviour</em> <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>than in the titles of the papers themselves. This is consistent with <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of Whittaker <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#WHI1989">1989</a>) whose comparative study of title keywords and subject descriptors found that keywords and subject descriptors are comparable. However, keywords have a tendency to highlight <em>original</em> aspects of the author's contribution whereas the subject descriptors tend to emphasise placement of the paper in relationship to other publications within the field.</p>

<p>Once keywords were <span>controlled</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and categorised for variations (such as Web and World Wide Web), 341 <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>keywords were identified across all conferences. Of these 256 (75% of total keywords) appear only once. The unique keywords demonstrate a very heterogeneous group, which has a tendency to be combined with <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>themes and introduces variations of context, methodology or specific concepts. At the top end of the <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the terms appearing do coincide, unsurprisingly, with the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>themes of the conferences series. In order of most to least frequent the terms are: <em>information seeking</em> (18% of total keywords), <em>information behaviour</em> (10%), <em>information use</em> (7%), <em>information needs</em> (6%), <em>information seeking behaviour</em> (5%). Of the total papers presented within the conference series 128 (60%) of papers contain at least one of these theme keywords either in the title or in the author-provided keywords. There is no indication that author-provided keywords from the 2004 and 2006 use these broad categories more <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>than earlier titles with the exception of the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>information behaviour whose usage increases from 1 in the 1996 conference, to 5 in the 2002 conference to 10 and 12 in the 2004 and 2006 conferences <span>respectively</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>  </p>

<p>Further examination of these five theme keywords revealed that 24 (11%) papers combined more than one keyword indicating themes. The <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><em>information seeking</em> was combined an equal number of times with <em>information behaviour</em> and <em>information use</em>. To examine the extent of <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>with terms not indicating theme a further analysis was completed assigning all non-theme terms to the categories context, concept and method. <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>1, below, provides a visualisation of the subjects across the conferences. For ease of viewing, the <span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>only shows the subjects that appear more than three times within the keywords.  The most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>used <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>with a theme was the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of a context (93 instances), for example information seeking of security analysts. Introduction of concepts in <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>with a theme was less frequent at 61 instances and methods were least <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>at 31 instances. This analysis indicates that the most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>occurring pattern for publication in the conference series is papers that address a theme of ISIC and then introduce a context in which the theme is examined. This is unsurprising in some respects but does <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>criteria and <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of papers is closely aligned with the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>aims of the conference series.</p>

<h3>Mapping conference authors</h3>

<p>In addition to exploring the paper titles, we also generated a <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of all authors appearing in the ISIC programmes since 1996. Author <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>were standardised to control for name variations (for example Carol C. Kuhlthau and Carol Kuhlthau, were included as the same author). </p>

<p>Between 1996 and 2006 (six ISIC conferences) there have been 232 presenters and co-authors. Of these 180 (78%) have contributed one paper, so the heavy majority of presenters are not repeat presenters though this <span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>does not address attendances (i.e., where the presenter has attended but not presented). Correspondingly, there is a small number of members who have presented at more than one conference. Only four authors have presented at five conferences, with six presenters presenting three and four times. The 2006 conference had the clear majority of first time presenters, (51 presenters) with the next highest being 33 single time presenters in 1998 and 2000, who of course have not presented at an ISIC conference since this time.</p>

<p>Figure 2 is a visualisation of the patterns of contribution across the ISIC conference series for contributors of more than one paper. In the centre of the visualisation are authors who have contributed presentations to five of the six ISIC conferences. As can be seen from the visualisation there are a number of authors who do not contribute in a continuous or sequential pattern but rather will have gap years in which they do not present, though only one author (author 53) has presented at only the 1996 and the 2006 conferences and no others.</p>

<h2>A slice of ISIC 2006</h2>

<p>Our <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>now turns to ISIC 2006, where our project was able, through its diverse data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>techniques, to collect impressions of ISIC from some of the conference participants. In many ways the field of information seeking research is defined by the ISIC conference series. This paper <span>discusses</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>how Conference participants were defining that field and their reasons for attending the Conference. Responses to questionnaires distributed before and during the conference suggested that ISIC is viewed by many as their core conference for hearing about the latest research. Unsurprisingly, they used many different terms to describe and label the conference, or more specifically, the content of papers being presented. To explore this aspect of our <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>responses, we tapped into a small part of the rich field materials collected before and during the three <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>conference. Exploring these responses helps us better understand what <em>information seeking in context</em> meant for these participants in ISIC 2006.</p>

<p>With the permission of the ISIC Programme Committee, all conference registrants received an e-mail message shortly before the conference, introducing the project and inviting them to complete a pre-conference <span>survey</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> We received a total of 53 responses to invitations sent to the 90 participants registered at the time with 39 respondents (73%) reporting they had never attended an ISIC conference before the Sydney event. It is interesting that 12 of the 14 respondents who <strong>had</strong> been to an ISIC conference prior to the one in Sydney had attended the 2004 conference <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in Dublin. (By the first <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the conference a total of 111 people had registered).</p>

<p>The section of the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>we <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on in this paper had a slightly lower <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>rate, with 49 usable responses. Of these responses, we found that 85% (N=49) reported that the conference themes were specifically related to their own work. These respondents described themselves as researchers, practitioners and/or educators, reflective of the conference's appeal to research and practice communities.</p>

<p>One of the questions asked: <em>Are you interested in following research in particular area/s at ISIC? If yes, please specify which areas.</em> Although a large proportion of these <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>respondents were attending their first ISIC conference, we found it interesting that 73 % (N=49) of <strong>all</strong> respondents replied YES to this question. Thirty-five of those respondents went on to specify areas of interest to them. We decided to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>our initial analysis on responses to this question and the topics supplied by these respondents.</p>

<p>The 35 respondents to this part of the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>supplied topics of interest very similar to the core topics identified in our <span>mapping</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the ISIC landscape: <em>information behaviour</em> (31%), <em>information seeking</em> (23%), <em>information use</em> (14%) and <em>information seeking behaviour</em> (11%) were the most common terms. In their responses, there was a tendency to offer very specific interests within these broad categories that fell within groupings similar to the <em>concept</em> and <em>context</em> clusters identified in the papers. These participants were particularly interested in organizational, health and <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>settings. For example, one respondent stated <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>interests as: '<em>barriers/inducements to information seeking</em>' and another <span>wrote</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>'<em>information seeking in the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>library environment</em>'.</p>

<p>To extend our analysis of the pre-conference <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>responses, we examined the 25 written responses to the conference <span>survey</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>s two opening questions (<em>What brings you to ISIC? What does ISIC mean to you?</em>). Like the pre-conference <span>survey</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> we found the majority of respondents described the ISIC conference as their <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>conference for information behaviour and related fields. This was the case for <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> early-career and <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>scholars and information professionals.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>Mindful that not everyone attending the ISIC conferences presents a paper and that not all information exchanges are connected to formal <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of a conference paper, charting the ISIC landscape does provide a sense of what participants are hearing at the conference and what, through the formal programme at least, is on offer. It also provides a useful <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>point for exploring the responses collected during ISIC 2006 about attendees' topics of interest. </p>

<h3>What information is on offer at an ISIC conference?</h3>

<p>Our <span>mapping</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the ISIC landscape <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>some indicators that ISIC does indeed have core <span>business</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> as <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in the five themes listed earlier. Analysis of this aspect of the <span>mapping</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is in the early stages but is helping to shed light on the themes on offer at ISIC conferences. It is <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>noting the high incidents of papers falling within the context cluster. Potential relationships between these clusters and the five core themes need to be examined further to identify thematic trends and mergers.</p>

<p>While it is evident from comments collected at ISIC 2006 that many participants have attended two or more ISIC conferences, the large number of one-time presenters suggests that the core <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the ISIC <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>indicated by <span>mapping</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the conference papers is delivered by a fluid mix of authors. These <span>figures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>may <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to a very small and dedicated core of contributors and may <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>some interesting patterns of engagement with the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or section of presentations. Further research is planned to identify the relationship between attendance and contribution as well as the role presenters feel the ISIC conferences take in their careers. The youth of the conference series may be a contributing factor in the low instance of repeat presenters. </p>

<h3>What are participants seeking at ISIC conferences?</h3>

<p>Thematically <span>speaking</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> the interests of our slice of ISIC 2006 participants <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>well within the core themes and clusters characterising the ISIC landscape since 1996. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>matrix of a <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>between their topics and keywords from the analysis of conference papers confirmed a good alliance between the broad areas of interest cited by ISIC 2006 participants and the topics presented at the conference. In both surveys, participants described ISIC as their <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>conference for keeping informed about research in their field. There is no indication that they were coming for very specific information but rather, as Phil described it, to keep up with what is happening in the field. An interesting artifact of the self-selection of our pre-conference <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>respondents was that the majority of them were first-timers. As such, we gained some insight into reasons someone might decide to attend an ISIC conference for the first time. Interestingly, responses to the conference <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>were collected from first-time and <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>ISIC participants and garnered similar responses in terms of thematic interests of participants.</p>

<p>Comments in both surveys <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that locating the 2006 event in the Asia-Pacific attracted attendees and presenters who have <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the ISIC literature for some time but been unable to attend earlier conferences (most often, the reason provided being the cost and duration of travel to Europe). Preliminary scans of authors at previous conferences and anecdotal information about the participants at them <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that each ISIC conference attracts people from the host institution's <span>region</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> It may also help explain the high author turnover uncovered in the <span>mapping</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>exercise. In this way, ISIC takes on a local flavour that also contributes to its character.</p>

<p>There were indications of professional as well as geographic diversity within the ISIC <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Responses in both surveys were provided by researchers and practitioners ranging from <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and early-career through to senior researchers and seasoned professionals. Mary, a research student in the early stages of a PhD described ISIC as a place to '<em>…meet people, talk, sounding board for ideas</em>'. Her comments were not all that different from Sarah, a mid-career academic who described ISIC as:</p>

<blockquote>…the heart of our domain… ISIC is a unique venue for people who study people and information - nurturing and creative <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>shared history, don't have to explain; go back and question traditional assumptions; cutting edge.</blockquote>

<p>When asked about what brings them to ISIC, most respondents mentioned the value of meeting with people with similar research interests. It is not just about presenters at a conference, however, but about meeting and networking with other participants, as Ellen (a senior information behaviour researcher) observed:</p>

<blockquote>ISIC is a <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>venue for me. The <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>means that most papers are relevant to me. It allows me to <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>work of selected researchers I've <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for years. It allows me to get feedback on my own research and it helps me work with my own (and others') doctoral <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></blockquote>

<p>Phil commented that dialogue at the conference '…affirms the value of the <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>. Repeatedly in both surveys, respondents used terms like '<em>community</em>', '<em>collegial</em>', '<em>network</em>', '<em>meeting place</em>' and even '<em>family</em>' to describe the ISIC conference. When asked what ISIC means to her, Viv responded:</p>

<blockquote>Although ISIC has meant nothing to me before this, I now use it as a place where I will have something in common with all the researchers.</blockquote>

<p>People are attracted to the ISIC conferences because of people. Three of the pre-conference <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>respondents, for instance, listed authors whose work they follow rather than topics when answering our question about areas of interest at ISIC 2006.  </p>

<h2>Conclusion and lessons learned</h2>

<p>Conferences and the information they can make available to us serve <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>functions in scholarly and research practice, contributing to the monitoring of developments in the field and nurturing the personal networks that support and sustain an individual's research and personal development. The <span>mapping</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of both the ISIC landscape and our <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>respondents' comments about their interests helps us to understand what the field means in the ISIC conference series. By exploring what attracted our respondents to ISIC 2006 and what ISIC means to them, we also begin to get a picture of the many facets of ISIC and the role it plays in the lives of researchers, practitioners and educators who attend. ISIC is described as a conference, a <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> a theme, a research <span>focus</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Our study of the ISIC conference and responses of participants in the Sydney event illustrate the role this particular conference series can and does play in the research and information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of researchers and practitioners who identify with the field of information behaviour in its many manifestations. In this way, the project contributes to a fuller understanding not only of the interlacing of research and information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>but ISIC's contribution to the shaping of information behaviour research.</p>

<p>The <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>tools used for our ISIC 2006 field work has provided a very rich <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of material to tap into within our project. The data gathering process was, however, labour intensive and owes a great <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the enthusiastic team of research assistants who worked at the event. As the results reported here illustrate, the approach is serving us well. Capturing the context of a fast-paced three <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>conference is an intense field work experience. Resources (time, effort, assistants) permitting, attempting such a suite of data gathering activities helps provide rich context for research questions that evolve through the analysis of a fast-paced special event like a research conference. In this way, we are able to collect slices of activity within a conference and across a conference series.</p>

<p>This paper introduces some of the patterns and <span>dynamics</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of topics and contributing authors that have emerged from the slices collected over ten years of ISIC conferences and analysed in our project thus far. In this way, we begin to understand the rhythms of research activity associated with this conference series. We will continue to work with the material collected at ISIC 2006 to better understand some of the rhythms of activity that take place within a single conference event. Taking advantage of the diverse sources of information about conference activity to extend the analysis <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in this paper, longitudinal work will also continue to explore the research <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of some ISIC participants and examine in greater detail how information at ISIC 2006 is used by some of our project participant (authors and attendees). In <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>work we also intend to examine more fully the comments made in both surveys indicating that many people attend ISIC conferences because of a desire to connect to researchers, not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>specific research (areas). Finally, we are also continuing with the work started at ISIC 2006: collecting personal recollections of ISIC conferences from people who have been active within the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>since the 1996 event in Tampere, Finland. In this way we intend to extend our initial exploration of the formal <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to begin unpacking, at the formal as well as informal levels, ways information is generated through an ISIC conference.</p>

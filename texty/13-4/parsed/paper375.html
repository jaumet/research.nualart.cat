<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Library and Information Science (LIS) has had an enduring and deep interest in ensuring that the results of research are readily available to inform practice (see, for example, <a href="#Mancall">Mancall <i>et al.</i> 1982</a>; <a href="#Holley">Holley and Kenan 1988</a>; <a href="#McClure">McClure 
1989</a>). Understanding of the importance of a strong relationship between research and practice is <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by both practitioners and scholars and also the agencies and governments that fund them. Balslev (<a 
href="#Blaslev">1989</a>), director of a Scandinavian public library, persuasively argues that research is <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for library planning and to justify expenditures in times of economic cutbacks. Lankes 
(<a href="#Lankes">2005</a>), a scholar and researcher specializing in digital <span>reference</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> asserts that research and practice must connect on a meaningful level in order to prevent unusable research and untestable practice. Streatfield (<a href="#Streatfield">2000</a>), reporting on a study that examined the transfer of research to library, museum and archives practice in Great Britain, notes that <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>about this transfer is high on the government agenda in the United Kingdom. While previous research has specifically explored the human information behaviour research (see, for example, <a href="#Julien">Julien and Duggan 2002</a>; <a href="#McKechnie02">McKechnie <em>et al.</em>  2002</a>), none has looked at the question of whether or not human information behaviour research is interpreted for or communicated to practice. The importance of this issue is reinforced by the Call for papers for ISIC 2008 which includes the following statement: &quot;For the 2008 Conference we shall be particularly interested in papers in any of these areas that address the connection between information research and information practice&quot; (<a href="#ISIC">ISIC 2008</a>). Inspired by this statement we set out to explore if and how information behaviour researchers may already be connecting their work to information practice. </p>

<h2>Literature review</h2>

<p>The literature of library and information science constructs the relationship between research and practice as problematic in a number of ways. While Powell <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#Powell">2002</a>) found that almost 90% of North American library and information science practitioners regularly read at least one research journal, only about 50% occasionally applied research results to their professional <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>variety of reasons have been suggested to explain this. Blick (<a href="#Blick">1984</a>) indicates that many practitioners may have a negative attitude towards information science research because they do not see it as being relevant. This is reinforced by Senn (<a href="#Senn">1998</a>) who reports that information technology practitioners do not see published research as relevant, readable, <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or timely. In a study of library practitioners charged with making research <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>available to health care workers, Bexon <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#Bexon">2003</a>) identified problems with cost-effectiveness and the overly long time needed for communication with workers as barriers to this work. Turner (<a href="#Turner">2002</a>) found the use of research by library professionals to be low with time restraints identified as the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>barrier. Participants in the study felt use would be higher if <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>implications were included in the research reports and if summaries of <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were included in professional media. Haddow and Klobas (<a href="#Haddow">2004</a>) identify eleven gaps in the relationship between research and practice: knowledge, culture, motivation, relevance, immediacy, publication, <span>reading</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>terminology</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> activity, <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and temporal. They report that only one strategy, including research reports in practitioner publications, has been shown by research to be effective in closing the gap and argue that more research needs to be done to find <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to bridge the gaps between research and practice. Finally, it has been suggested that the emergence of evidence-based librarianship with its <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on research informed practice, may encourage more librarians to read library and information science research reports (<a href="#Booth">Booth 2003</a>; <a href="#Clyde">Clyde 2006</a>).</p>

<p>Not surprisingly other disciplines with professional arms have also been very interested in the relationship between research and practice. These include Education, Nursing and <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Work. As with our own field, their literatures highlight the need to address what is seen as a problem. Recent examples of this may be found for Education in Churcher (<a href="#Churcher">2007</a>), for Nursing in Doran and Sidani (<a href="#Doran">2007</a>) and for <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Work in Gibbs (<a href="#Gibbs">2007</a>). Each of these disciplines has also made unique <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to our understanding of the research practice issue. One way the literature of Education is different is that it includes more work published in journals with professional readership that specifically targets practising teachers. Examples of this include Hodges (<a href="#Hodges">1996</a>) and Myers (<a href="#Myers">2006</a>). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>theme in the literature of <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Work is its <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the need to integrate research into practice and encourage social workers to participate in field studies. Typical of this are articles by <span>Franklin</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#Franklin">1999</a>) and Tsang (<a href="#Tsang">2000</a>). Unlike library and information science, Nursing has <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the information seeking of nurses as an important and relevant <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>factor. Recent examples of this work include Tannery <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#Tannery">2007</a>), McKnight (<a href="#McKnight">2006</a>) and Dee and Stanley (<a href="#Dee">2005</a>). Nursing has also brought relevant theory to the examination of the <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>between research and practice, including Roger’s diffusion of innovations (<a href="#Barta">Barta 1995</a>) and uncertainty theory (<a href="#French">French 2006</a>). All three of these disciplines have more <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>publication in the area of evidence-based practice than library and information science. This is particularly true for Nursing, perhaps because the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of research relevant to the field are clearer and more generalizable. <span>Publications</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>from Education such as Ruthven (<a href="#Ruthven">2005</a>), from Nursing such as Penz and Bassendowski (<a href="#Penz">2006</a>) and from <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Work such as McNeill (<a href="#McNeill">2006</a>) which clearly link evidence-based practice to greater <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of research and practice <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that the further development of evidence-based practice in library and information science may also help to bridge the divide. </p>

  <p>This work reports on the latest of a series of research projects that have <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>how human information behaviour researchers go about doing their work including their use of theory (<a href="#McKechnie01">McKechnie <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>), their use of methods (<a href="#McKechnie02">McKechnie <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>), how they use each other’s work to inform their own research (<a href="#McKechnie04">McKechnie <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>) and how they construct study participants in their reports of research (<a href="#McKechnie06">McKechnie <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>). It asks the following research questions: <i>Are the results of human information behaviour research being interpreted and reported for application to the work of LIS practitioners and if so, how?</i></p>

<h2>Method</h2>

<p>Published proceedings of the ISIC conferences from 1996 to 2006 include a total of 181 articles of which 117 (64.6%) are reports of <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>research (as <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to theoretical, methodological or other types of papers). To answer our research questions we conducted a content analysis of the 117 research reports. While human information behaviour researchers communicate their work through a variety of publications and conferences, ISIC is chosen as one being of the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>international venues for dissemination of human information behaviour research. </p>

<p>In total, 117 articles were analysed. These were more or less evenly distributed across the six conferences (1996, n=17; 1998, n=19; 2000, n=20; 2002, n=18; 2004, n=22; 2006; n=21). The articles were coded for: <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>affiliation of each author; use of theory; method(s) employed; the presence of explicit implications for practice; and, if implications for practice were included, the parts of the article (title, <span>abstract</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and literature <span>search</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> method, results, discussion and conclusion) where these were found. All articles that included implications for practice were further analysed to determine what <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were used by authors to do this and to see whether or not the <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was accessible to practitioners. To be included in this subset, an article simply had to state that the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were relevant to practitioners of library and information science with or without specifically delineating what these implications were. For example, one paper in which the authors stated the study 'may have both theoretical and <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>implications' was included in the subset of articles analysed. Finally, both <i>Library Literature &amp; Information Science Index</i> and <i>Library and Information Science Abstracts</i> were searched for each project <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in a paper to see if the results of the work had been shared elsewhere with a particular interest in sources such as professional publications with strong practitioner target audiences. This was accomplished by conducting author searches and examining the papers found to determine whether they were about the same project reported on in the ISIC paper. In other words, we looked for other acts of communication that complemented the ISIC papers. </p>

<p>A random <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of ten articles was selected and re-coded by an independent coder. This individual was purposefully chosen as an active practitioner with fifteen years of professional experience and a strong background in, and understanding of, scholarly research. The <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of inter-coder reliability resulted in an agreement rate of 86%, suggesting that the coding scheme was robust and <span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a

<h2>Findings</h2>

<h3>Characteristics of the papers and the research studies they represent</h3>

<p>The total number of authors included in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is 217. Authors are internationally diverse with 80 (36.9%) coming from the United States, 42 (19.4%) from the United Kingdom, 31 (14.3%) from Scandinavia, 20 (9.2%) from Asia, 17 (7.8%) from Canada, 14 (6.5%) from other European countries, 11 (5.0%) from Australia and New Zealand, and 2 (0.9%) from other areas of the world. Of the 217 authors 167 (76.9%) are affiliated with academic library and information science programmes, 29 (13.3%) are also associated with <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>but work in other disciplines, 11 (5.1%) are affiliated with research centres, 8 (3.7%) are practitioners listing a library or information centre as their work place and 2 (1%) are affiliated with other types of organizations. With a ratio of almost 18:1, scholars (n=196, 90%) clearly outnumber practitioners (n=8, 3.7%) as contributors to the ISIC literature. The eight practitioner authors contributed to <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>papers, four of which were single-authored and the other three completed with one or more scholarly authors. Interestingly, five of the <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>papers (71%) with at least one practitioner author included implications for practice, a rate somewhat higher than that found for the total <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(59%).</p>

<p>Just over two thirds (n=80, 68.4%) of the papers reported the use of one or more theories or theoretical frameworks. Most (n=62, 78.5%) of the 79 theories cited in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were only mentioned once with an additional 14 (17.7%) being used in either two or three papers. The three most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>cited theories were Savolainen’s Everyday Life Information Seeking (four times), Dervin’s Sense Making (six times) and Kuhlthau’s Information Search Process (nine times). </p>

<p>All but one of the papers identified one or more methods used to collect data. The most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>used methods were interviews (used in 85 or 73.2% of the 116 papers that included methods), surveys and questionnaires (n=38, 17.6%), observation (n=36, 16.7%) and content or document analysis (n=22, 10.2%). Of the 85 (n=78, 72.7%) papers reporting where data was collected, 78 (91.8%) identified real-life field settings and <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(8.2%) <span>laboratory</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>settings. Research participants came from all <span>sorts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of everyday and work life <span>contexts</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> including, for example, adult readers, medical oncologists, Spanish <span>speaking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>workers, homeless parents, <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and managers. </p>

<h3>Communicating implications for practice: basic results</h3>

<p>While 41% (n=48) of the articles did not include implications for practice, 59% (n=69) did, suggesting that a majority of information behaviour researchers do include implications for practice as part of their research reporting. Authors presented this information in various parts of their papers as follows: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Title: 4 (5.8% of papers including implications for practice)</li> 
  <li>Abstract: 24 (29.5% of the 81 papers that had abstracts - the proceedings of 1996 and 1998 did not have abstracts)</li> 
  <li>Introduction / literature search: 13 (18.8%)</li> 
  <li>Method: 2 (2.9%) </li>
  <li>Results: 6 (8.7%) </li>
  <li>Discussion/conclusion: 58 (84.1%)</li> 
  <li>Separate, clearly labeled section: 2 (2.9%) </li></ul>

<p>Implications for practice were most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>incorporated in the discussion and/or <span>conclusion</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the paper, <span>arguably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>not only an appropriate location but also one that highlights the importance of this type of information. Although only a small number, the two papers that gave implications for practice a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>section <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that these authors highly value this aspect of their work. Inclusion of implications for practice in the title and in the <span>abstract</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the papers also point to its importance and make these papers easier to identify for the professional looking for information that <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>informs practice. </p>

<p>It has been suggested that one of the potential barriers involved in access to research by professionals is the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of readability of research reports. For example, Stevens <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#Stevens">2005</a>) examined the effectiveness of an information service which repackaged and communicated research results in an easy-to-read format for social workers. To explore this factor the ISIC papers were also analysed to determine whether or not the <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>would be accessible to practitioner readers. In making these <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>we worked with the <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that library and information science professionals were likely to have taken an introductory research methods course while completing their post-secondary, professional degrees and so would be <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with basic research <span>terminology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and processes. Overall 96 (82.1%) of the papers were <span>judged</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as being accessible to practitioners, ten (8.5%) were not and 11 (9.4%) included <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that was readable in parts and non-accessible in other parts. Challenging papers were characterized by the use of highly specialized research jargon, complex conceptual ideas and dense, wordy prose. These attributes can be seen in the following excerpt from one ISIC paper: (To protect the identity of authors, we have not included bibliographic information for these excerpts, which are provided to illustrate particular <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and should not be construed as indicative of the overall <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of any particular paper.)</p>

<blockquote>The authors report on two projects in which the role of <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as temporal boundary objects mediating information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>across multiple timelines was explored . . . Two workplaces were studied: a professional theatre production and a midwifery clinic. Both settings are communities constructed partly through textual <span>dynamics</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and both have a pre-production phase leading to an opening night. </blockquote>

<p>Authors whose work was more accessible included <span>explanations</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of difficult terms and conceptual ideas, <span>wrote</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in a <span>straight</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>forward manner, used clear descriptive headings, included <span>tables</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> charts and diagrams which visually presented <span>findings</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and included examples such as quotations by study participants to illustrate <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> The following is an example of accessible <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>encountered in the ISIC papers: </p>

<blockquote>In summary, the information seeking of professionals model does not completely explain the information behaviour of police officers who work undercover as decoys. One reason may be that, because it evolved from the literature of health care professionals, engineers and lawyers, it is too formal and reflects more traditional types of work in an institutional <span>setting</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Unlike these professionals who work in environments where they can access print or electronic information, the decoys work on the street, in a chaotic, real-time <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Their only sources of information are those in the immediate environment: the johns, prostitutes, and members of their team.

  <p>Searches of <i>Library Literature &amp; Information Science Index</i> and <i>Library and Information Science Abstracts</i> revealed that 68 (58.1%) of the projects covered by the ISIC papers had been reported on at other conferences and published in other venues, with some being reported elsewhere more than once. The ISIC conferences attract largely scholarly participants and communication of the results of the ISIC paper projects through other media has the potential to reach different groups. Unfortunately closer analysis of this data <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>otherwise as most alternate venues were also scholarly in nature. Six (4.3%) of the studies <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>elsewhere as unpublished doctoral dissertations. The annual conference proceedings of ASIST and Aslib accounted for more than 90% of the 41 occurrences in conference proceedings. Over half (n=79, 56.4%) of the 140 instances of alternate publication occurred in journals whose target audience is primarily scholarly including <i>Information Processing &amp; Management</i>, <i>Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology</i>, the <i>Journal of Documentation</i>, <i>Library &amp; Information Science Research</i>, <i>Library Quarterly</i> and the <i>Journal of Information Science</i>. Only 12 (8.6%) of the occurrences were in journals such as <i>Reference Librarian</i>, <i>Public Libraries</i> and <i>Online</i> which have substantial professional readership. While a significant proportion of the ISIC papers include implications for practice, this analysis suggests authors do not often seek communication venues that are inclusive of practitioners. </p>

<p>Together the results of the above <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>suggest that information behaviour researchers do a <span>reasonable</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>job of including the implications of their work for practice in their research reports. While the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of these studies appear to have largely been communicated through scholarly venues, almost 60% of the ISIC papers include implications for practice and over 80% of the papers were deemed readable for professionals. However, a closer look at how authors <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>describe implications for practice reveals a more problematic <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<h3>Communicating results to practice: <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>used by authors</h3>

<p>Authors used a variety of <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to communicate the implications of their work for practice. Some of these were effective and others were not. One common ineffective strategy was to include vague <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that claimed the results of a study had implications for practice without <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>delineating any. For example, one author <span>wrote</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the study '<i>may have both theoretical and <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>implications.</i>' Another stated '<i>[t]his has <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>implications for the articulation assistance provided by the system and the advice <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to searchers.</i>' Other authors listed conclusions that had implicit implications for practice but never explicitly stated these as in the following example: '<i>An important <span>conclusion</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the study determined that homeless parents rely on information networking rather than information <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></i>' Finally some authors mentioned implications for practice but then only gave implications for <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>research as can be seen in the following: '<i>Further investigations can improve our understanding of these behaviours and assist in the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and evaluation of new information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for clinicians. In <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>studies we intend to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on . . .</i>' </p>

<p>As frustrating as these <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are, they are still somewhat better than those employed by authors who signaled implications would be given but then did not deliver. The first <span>sentence</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the discussion section of one paper reads '<i>What are the implications of this study on health information sources in newsgroups discussions?</i>' but does not go on to answer the question. The <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of another paper states '<i>Our long-term aim is to build an evidence-based model of effective searching, based on <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>data, to inform the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of training and of intelligent adaptive <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>interfaces.</i>' However, no implications for practice are given related to the results of this particular study in the <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>research agenda. In a final example, one paper has a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>section heading <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>'<i>Implications for research and practice</i>' though none are to be found in the ensuing two and one half pages that follow the heading. </p>

<p>It was encouraging to see that some authors did use effective <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to convey implications of their research results for practice. One approach used was to integrate this information <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the paper. Statements such as '<i>[it must be] the woman with breast cancer who controls the flow of information, and

For example, under the heading '<i>Implications for information seeking and information retrieval systems</i>' one paper listed a number of very precise suggestions arising from the results such as the following: '<i>We can incorporate new capabilities into information retrieval <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by indicating topical relevance relationships in indexing; the indexer not only identifies the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to which a piece of information is related but also indicates in what way they are related.</i>' </p>

<p>Overall, of the 69 papers including implications for practice, 39 (56.5%) did not do so through clear explicit <span>statements</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> 27 (39.1%) did and three (4.3%) used both <span>approaches</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>While it appears that information behaviour researchers often address implications for practice in the reports of their research, they seldom do this well. What accounts for this mediocre performance? We argue that the culture of scholarship and the <span>academy</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>works against a more vigorous research:practice relationship. This is a culture which <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>'<i>to place greater value on research-based knowledge than on experience-based knowledge</i>' (<a 
href="#Estabrooks">Estabrooks <em>et al.</em> 2005: 1</a>). As noted by Thyer (<a href="#Thyer">2001: 9</a>) '<i>the message conveyed in research texts, doctoral <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>standards, and disciplinary guidelines [affirms] that research should build and <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>theory, rather than <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>applied problems.</i>' Promotion and tenure processes privilege peer-reviewed publication and other forms of communication that have scholars and researchers as their target audiences. Research funding, almost always relatively <span>limited</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> often does not afford scholars opportunities to travel to professional conferences to <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>about their work and many <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>do not allow their faculty travel funds to be used in this way. </p>

<p>What then can be done to address the divide between research and practice in information behaviour? What are the implications, if you will, arising from this study for <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>which might increase communication and cooperation across the gap. We <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the following: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Just as the organizers of ISIC 2008 have specifically encouraged the submission of papers that include implications for practice, journal editors and other gatekeepers of scholarly communication could <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>authors to include this information in their research reports.</li> 
  <li>We must work to change policies and <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that restrict researcher participation in professional conferences.</li> 
  <li>We must work to develop more venues where both researchers and practitioners can meet to share information. </li>
  <li>Information behaviour researchers should use language which makes their <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>more accessible to non-scholars.</li> 
  <li>Taking a cue from the research in nursing discussed above, studies of the information behaviour of librarians and other information professionals are needed to help us understand how to best share the results of research with them.</li> 
  <li>Greater use should be made of practitioner current awareness media to disseminate research results, particularly in summary forms that can be read quickly by professionals who have little time because of busy workplaces. Librarians are already doing this for professionals in other disciplines and could benefit from librarians who provide this service to them as well.</li> 
  <li>We must recognize that the gap between research and practice is '<i>a gap between two sharply contrasting <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge</i>' (<a href="#McIntyre">McIntyre 2005</a>) and that there are limitations as well as possibilities for <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>library and information science as a research based professional activity.</li> 
  <li>Finally, information behaviour researchers must bring greater consciousness to linking and reporting their research results to practice and information professionals. Individual <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>can overcome many of the real and perceived barriers to dialogue between research and practice. </li></ul>

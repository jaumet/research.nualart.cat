<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>What search features will be required for users to make effective use of
digital libraries? While the term "Digital Library" for collections of
electronic materials is relatively new, such collections have been in existence
for some time, for instance in large commercial on-line search services
such as Dialog, DataStar and Lexis. Over the years, a range of search features
– boolean and proximity operators, truncation, etc - have been developed
to facilitate access to these collections, and Library and Information
professionals have become skilled in their use. This paper attempts to
draw on the experience built up by searchers of "traditional" search services
such as Dialog, and to suggest the features that should be present in digital
library systems.</p>

<p>Why should we be concerned about the search features of digital libraries?
Evaluation of electronic information has in the last few years become an
important issue in library and information services (e.g. <a href="#ref2">Tillman 1998</a>,
<a href="#ref2">Smith, 1997</a>). Librarians and other information professionals, in building
collections and advising users of information, will need to be evaluate
the strengths and weaknesses of different digital libraries. A previous
paper (<a href="#ref2">Smith, 1998</a>) considers evaluation criteria for digital libraries,
including searchability.</p>

<p>There are at least three possible models for searching in a digital
library. One is that of the on-line Public Access Catalog (OPAC) used in
traditional libraries. Another is that of the Internet search engines,
such as Alta Vista and Inktomi. A third is that of the traditional on-line
search services such as Dialog, Data-Star and Nexis. OPACs are primarily
concerned with the searching of bibliographic records, and searching to
the level of items, rather than of the full text content of the items.
Internet search engines enable searching of content, but across a wide
range of documents with no standard structure. Traditional on-line search
services, while they started by providing searching of bibliographic databases,
have moved increasingly to full text databases (<a href="#ref2">Tenopir &amp; Berglund, 1993</a>)
but continue to include standardised bibliographic content such as subject
descriptors. Of the three models, traditional on-line search services provide
the closest model for the searching of digital libraries, which will be
both full text and usually have a standardised bibliographic structure.</p>

<p>This paper will examine features that are desirable for searching in
a digital library, and compare these with search features in some current
typical digital libraries.</p>

<p>The digital libraries surveyed were electronic collections that have
been described as digital libraries in locations such as <i>Digital Library
Research &amp; Development</i> at the <a href="http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/R+D/">Berkeley Digital Library Sunsite</a> or IFLA’s <i><a href="http://www.ifla.org/II/diglib.htm">Digital Libraries: Resources and Projects</a></i>, and which had substantial information resources accessible over the Internet,
rather than descriptions of information resources. A summary of the search
features available at each digital library is presented in Appendix 1.</p>

<h2>Search features of digital libraries</h2>

<p>The literature of on-line searching includes many treatments of search features.
<a href="#ref2">Walker &amp; Janes’s</a> (1993) basic text on on-line searching includes many features,
including boolean operators, controlled vocabulary, proximity searching,
etc. <a href="#ref2">Schwartz</a> (1993) presents a detailed checklist for CD-ROM search products,
including different modes of searching, field restrictions, indexing, etc.
There are many comparisons of search features of Internet search engines,
such as that maintained by <a href="#ref2">Winship</a> (1999), and critical reviews by <a href="#ref2">Poulter</a>
(1997) and <a href="#ref2">Schwartz</a> (1998).</p>

<h3>Boolean logic</h3>

<p>Information professionals have a long history of using boolean logic in
search services, and while raw boolean operators can be daunting to inexperienced
users and are counterintuitive (<a href="#ref2">Tenopir, 1997</a>), most search systems include
a form of boolean logic. Boolean operators appear in search systems in
a number of different forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>requiring that all the terms entered are present in retrieved items (implied
AND) or that at least some of the terms entered are present (implied OR)</li>

<li>marking terms with + (term must be present, equivalent to AND) or - (term
must not be present, equivalent to NOT)</li>

<li>dialogue boxes into which terms may be entered; the contents of windows
being connected by AND, OR, NOT ( the specific operators possibly being
fixed, or possibly being selectable by drop down menus etc)</li>

<li>A command mode, where operators are typed into a search statement. This
is most flexible, but requires more familiarity by the user.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nesting of operators (e.g. by brackets in command mode) is an important
tool for experienced on-line searchers, for instance to enable different
variations of a terms to be OR’d together, then AND’d with the terms representing
another concept; but is difficult to implement in other than command mode.</p>

<p>Of the eleven surveyed digital libraries, four had full boolean searching,
but none had no form of boolean searching.</p>

<p>Information professionals place some importance on boolean searching
because of the sense of control it affords. However it should be noted
that boolean searching is best suited to bibliographic databases, and that
for full text databases (which is what most digital libraries are) proximity
operators are desirable. ("bicycles AND marketing" in a bibliographic database
is likely to produce records that relate to marketing of bicycles; in a
full text database it may produce records where the terms are widely separated
and unrelated).</p>

<p>The OR operator performs a useful function in free text searching –
it provides the ability to specify a number of variations of terminology
for a concept. One of the barriers to effective searching is that for a
given topic, people will use a wide range of terms (<a href="#ref1">Bates, 1998</a>: 1188),
so it is important that searchers have the ability to incorporate as many
variant terms as possible into their search.</p>

<h3>Phrase and Proximity Searching</h3>

<p>Phrase searching means that words must be together in a specified order;
proximity searching is where a looser linking is specified, for instance
that the terms must appear within n words of each other. Many systems implement
phrase searching, for instance by placing quotes around the desired phrase,
or by the user selecting "exact phrase" from a menu. Proximity searching
is less common, but is important in full text databases since it can be
used to find records where the search terms occur and are related, e.g.
"bicycles NEAR marketing" will find records where the terms occur closely
to each other, and are hopefully related. If the extent of proximity is
controllable, the user has the flexibility to adjust the extent of linking
between search terms.</p>

<p>Five of the surveyed digital libraries had both phrase and proximity
searching, four had phrase searching, and only two had no form of proximity
or phrase searching (one of these libraries featured relevancy ranking,
though.</p>

<p>While proximity operators are powerful, it is worth remembering that
proximity is usually a factor in relevancy ranking, so a system with relevancy
ranking may <i>de facto</i> be allowing proximity.</p>

<h3>Relevancy ranking</h3>

<p>Newer search systems, especially those of Internet search engines, present
results ranked by "relevancy" as determined by an algorithms in the search
software.</p>

<p>Relevancy can be based on:

<ul>
<li>Frequency of search terms</li>

<li>Position of search terms</li>
</ul>

<p>Interestingly only six of the surveyed libraries used relevance ranking,
despite its popularity in the Internet environment. In general though,
it was difficult to determine how the relevancy was arrived at. This echoes
studies of Web search engines, where commercial considerations mean that
information about ranking algorithms are not widely available (<a href="#ref1">Courtois
<i>et al</i>, 1999)</a>.</p>

<p>Relevancy ranking performs some of the functions of a boolean AND and
of proximity operators: usually the highest ranked records will be those
where the terms appear in the same record, and close together. However
practical experience shows that some form of NOT is desirable for effective
searching on relevancy ranked systems: a search for "cycling" in the sense
of pedal cycling may be more effective if the items with the term "motor"
can be eliminated.</p>

<h3>Browsing of indexes</h3>

<p>Analyses of search success (<a href="#ref1">Drabenstott &amp; Weller, 1996</a>) usually find that
a significant number of errors are due to mistyping of search terms. This
issue can be addressed by allowing the searcher to browse and select terms
from alphabetical indexes of terms in the database – this is particularly
useful for names of people, where numerous variations of spelling and forms
of name can occur. In Dialog this is implemented with the EXPAND command,
and is widely used by experienced searchers.</p>

<p>Only one of the surveyed digital libraries provided the ability to browse
indexes, although four others provided limited implementations, for instance
within a specific collection, or browsing of author/ title lists. Given
the contribution that index browsing makes to search effectiveness, it
is surprising that this isn’t more widely implemented.</p>

<h3>Truncation</h3>

<p>Another way for searchers to address variations in forms and spelling is
truncation. This can be both internal (wom?n to find the terms "woman"
and "women") and external (comput? for computing, computer, etc). Systems
can allow automatic truncation, so a search for "comput" will retrieve
all terms starting with that term, or use algorithms that search for related
plurals, variations, etc from a dictionary. Automatic truncation is useful,
but can result in unwanted records, for instance a search for "factor"
in mathematics may usefully retrieve "factorial", but less usefully retrieve
"factory".</p>

<p>Six of the surveyed libraries provided truncation, and three provided
a form of automatic truncation.</p>

<h3>Field searching</h3>

<p>The traditional bibliographic record is structured into fields – author,
title, descriptor, etc. The ability to search these fields separately is
important, for two reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Different types of data require different tactics – titles are suited to
keyword searches, while an author search may be better performed by browsing
an index.</li>

<li>Restricting a search to a field can make the search more specific – a search
for "Wells" in the author field will separate items relating to HG Wells
from those relating to holes in the ground.</li>
</ul>

<p>Seven of the surveyed libraries enabled searching in specific fields, though
one of these was limited. Searching of specific fields is difficult to
implement in digital libraries that consist of collections with disparate
structures; for instance American Memory allows field searching in specific
collections, but does not allow field searching in an overall search of
the digital library.</p>

<h3>Extent of searching</h3>

<p>The extent of material in a database or collection that is searchable may
vary. A system may allow searching only of bibliographic data, or of the
full text of documents. If a printed resource has been digitised, there
can be variations in the material that is available for searching, for
instance articles in a journal may be searchable, but not letters, advertisements
etc. Searching on commonly occurring words (stopwords) may not be possible.
In some cases this can create problems: at one stage in the development
of a search system that the author was involved with, users were frustrated
in getting access to a magazine entitled <i>More</i> because the term "more"
was a stopword.</p>

<p>It can be desirable to limit the extent of searching – by restricting
to bibliographic data, the relevancy of retrieved records may be higher.
<p>Six of the surveyed libraries searched the full text of documents, three
were primarily databases of images with descriptions that were fully searchable,
and only two did not have full text searching, in both cases because the
text of the documents was distributed, or in a non-text format like PDF.
An interesting approach to the problem of full text searching of distributed
collections of full text is the NZ Digital Library, where searching indexes
are built from the document, but the actual documents are left at their
original sites (Witten <i>et al</i> 1996.</p>

<p>In two of the digital libraries surveyed (<i>Early Canadiana on-line
</i> and <i>Making of America</i>) a distinction needs to be made between images
of full text and text produced by Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
The OCR’d text was not displayed, because of its lack of quality, but was
used for search purposes. While this extended the potential of full text
searching, it raised the issue that errors in the OCR’d text might be influencing
retrieval accuracy.</p>

<h3>Case sensitive searching</h3>

<p>Case sensitive searching is uncommon in bibliographic systems, but is often
implemented in systems designed for file searching (e.g. in UNIX where
case is significant). For this reason it is sometimes available in digital
library systems. Three of the surveyed digital libraries implemented case
sensitive searching.</p>

<h3>Controlled vocabulary</h3>

<p>In bibliographic systems the use of subject headings or descriptors from
a controlled vocabulary (a thesaurus or list of subject headings), to describe
document content is common. By searching on a well designed and implemented
controlled vocabulary, users can improve results. However there can be
problems if the terms used in the controlled vocabulary are not obvious
to users, and there are problems with incorporating new and changed terminology
into a controlled vocabulary system. While there has been ongoing debate
in the information retrieval community about the relative effectiveness
of controlled vocabulary searching versus natural language, in practice
both approaches complement each other and are required for effective searches
(Bates 1988).</p>

<p>Five of the surveyed digital libraries implemented a controlled vocabulary,
and one included a limited implementation.</p>

<h3>Language translation</h3>

<p>In systems that incorporate materials in different languages, or accommodate
users who speak different languages, translation may be incorporated. Technical
problems mean that this has not been widely implemented in the past, language
translation is likely to be more common in the digital libraries of the
future, since networks make materials available in different language regions.
<p>Three of the digital libraries addressed language issues: <i>Early Canadiana
on-line</i> had both English and French subject headings, effectively enabling
multilingual searching. Perseus stored material in English and in Greek
(displayable in Greek characters with special software), and NCSTRL contained
material in several languages, but did not standardise subject terms, so
that an exhaustive search would require searching using all the possible
languages.</p>

<h3>Date/range searching</h3>

<p>A common way of restricting a large search set is to restrict to a particular
date range. Most commonly this is used to restrict to the more recent materials.
<p>Range searching is clearly a useful feature for digital libraries that
contain historical materials. Five of the eleven digital libraries surveyed
had some form of date searching or limitation.</p>

<h3>Refining of initial search</h3>

<p>Few searches can be completed in one command. Usually a heuristic process
takes place, with the searcher refining their search in response to the
results obtained. In a sophisticated search, a searcher may build up a
number of sets which are used as "building blocks" in developing flexible
search strategies (<a href="#ref2">Quint, 1991</a>).</p>

<p>Given the value of this approach, it is surprising to discover that
none of the digital libraries surveyed allowed the development of a search
with sets. Of course, in most cases it was possible to return to the search
window and add extra commands, but this does not permit the development
of sophisticated search strategies, and limits the overall effectiveness
of searching.</p>

<h3>Related items</h3>

<p>If the user finds a relevant item, it can be useful if they can search
on like items, for instance those that use keywords from that item. This
is an implementation of the "pearlgrowing" strategy (<a href="#ref2">Quint, 1991</a>).
<p>Only two of the eleven libraries implemented some form of related item
searching.</p>

<h3>Multimedia searching</h3>

<p>Searching for images, audio, and video usually takes place by searching
text descriptions. However the "holy grail" of multimedia searching lies
in the direct searching of images, for example for a defined shape, or
sound. These are mostly found in experimental systems, for example, <a href="#ref1">Chang
<i>et al</i>, 1997</a>, <a href="#ref1">McNab <i>et al</i>. 1997</a>. In the surveyed digital libraries,
the only true multimedia search feature was the NZDL’s music search.</p>

<h3>Advanced and basic search facilities</h3>

<p>Providing search facilities for users of differing abilities involves compromises.
A fully featured search interface for experienced users is likely to confuse
less experienced searchers, while a simple search interface will not provide
the power required for complex queries. While it is possible to have a
simple query interface (a box with "enter search terms here") which power
users can extend by commands, it is generally preferable to have defined
basic and advanced search interfaces.</p>

<p>Only six of the digital libraries had different modes of searching,
which probably reflects the fact that most were not offering a great range
of search features. If digital libraries increase the range of search features,
it will be necessary to introduce different modes of search interface.</p>

<h3>Display features</h3>

<p>As noted above, searching is a heuristic process, and part of the search
process is the display of records. Effective searching requires several
different display formats. When the search is being developed it is useful
for a searcher to see records that are brief, so that many can be scanned
quickly to determine the success of the search, and which include terms
such as descriptors that can be fed back into the search. Once a useful
search result set is obtained, a format is required, for instance with
an abstract or other indication of content, that enables selection of items
for viewing in full. Some research (Bates 1998 p.1198) indicates that the
human search process works in steps of 30: first selecting titles of documents,
then abstracts that are about 30 times the size of the title, then to documents
that are about 30 times the size of the abstract. This implies that designers
of digital library systems should provide display formats that enable users
to word from titles to full text in steps of about 30 times the previous
display format.</p>

<p>The order of display of items can be important – a standard default
on many systems is to display most recent items first, except where relevancy
retrieval is used. However in other circumstances author or title order
can be useful.</p>

<p>In the Internet environment, the ability to bookmark the URL of a specific
document or section of a digital library is useful, and is provided by,
for example, <i>Early Canadiana on-line.</i> In some other systems a URL
is generated on the fly, and is not bookmarkable.</p>

<p>All the digital libraries surveyed provided more than one format of
display, however it was not clear that this had been designed from the
point of view of facilitating search development, or of selection of items
for full viewing.</p>

<p>Where a digital library contains original documents that have been digitised,
a choice lies between displaying the image or the OCR’d text. Both have
their advantages: the image is more authentic but has bandwidth costs,
the text can be more easily read and manipulated, and transferred more
rapidly over networks. Some of the digital libraries sampled used OCR text
for searching, but displayed images, since it was felt that the OCR was
of insufficient quality for display (e.g. Early Canadiana on-line). However
a searcher might find it useful to have the choice of which format to display,
both for the reasons alluded to, and to aid the development of search strategy.</p>

<h3>Help and documentation information</h3>

<p>Like other software systems, search systems require help information to
be available to the searcher. Issues in help information for the digital
libraries surveyed included cases where the help information referred to
features that were no longer present, and there are some areas where insufficient
information is given, for instance as to how ranking is determined.
<p>All the surveyed libraries had help information.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Traditional on-line search services such as Dialog have developed a wide
range of search features, that allow users to perform sophisticated searches
for a variety of queries. Although developments in search engine technology
(ranking, automatic term expansion, etc) have made it easier for novice
users to perform searches without using these sophisticated features, experienced
users are likely to require a greater range of search features for carrying
out more complex searches. In developing search interfaces for digital
libraries, the objective should not be to find the "ideal" search features,
but to provide a range of search features allowing different types of searches,
and accommodating different search styles and levels of searcher experience.
As digital collections grow larger, the level of sophistication required
to perform effective searches is likely to increase.</p>

<p>While the eleven digital libraries surveyed provided overall a wide
range of search features, none provided the wide range of features that
traditional on-line services provide. Digital library designers should consider
providing a wider range of features in future versions of their software.
<p>Features that do not appear to be widely available, but which have proved
their worth in traditional on-line services, are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full boolean searching, in particular OR operators and nesting, to facilitate
the incorporation of alternative terminology for concepts. The NOT operator
should be an option, particularly in conjunction with relevancy ranking.</li>

<li>Proximity, as well as phrase searching. Phrase searching assists finding
specific terms, but proximity searching is an effective way to specify
that terms are closely related in a full text digital library.</li>

<li>Browsing of terms in the database. This offers a convenient way for searchers
to establish the variant forms of a search term, and may overcome many
problems with misspelling.</li>

<li>Searching of specific fields. This enables searchers to use tactics suited
to the nature of different types of information.</li>

<li>Controlled vocabulary and other metadata. While this is expensive to implement,
and there is ongoing debate in the retrieval community as to its effectiveness,
at least some classes of searches are enhanced by subject descriptors.
<a href="http://purl.org/DC/">The Dublin Core</a> and other metadata projects are leading
the way in this area.</li>

<li>Refining of an initial search. The "building block" strategy has been shown
to be effective in on-line databases, but requires the ability to create
and save a range of search sets, which can then be refined.</li>

<li>Related items. The ability to "pearl-grow" searches, feeding terms from
relevant items back into iterations of the search strategy, is valuable,
and can be facilitated by a related items feature in a search interface.</li>

<li>Advanced and basic search interfaces. If a useful range of search features
is provided, it will be necessary to provide different search interfaces
for different types of user and different types of search.</li>

<li>A range of display modes should be available, to facilitate development
of search strategy, and to enable selection of items for further viewing
or printing. Searchers should be able to examine the text that was searched,
in the case of OCR’d text.</li>
</ul>

<p>Multilingual indexing and searching are likely to become an issue as digital
libraries become a global resource. Ideally a searcher should be able to
enter terms in one language, and find relevant documents in the library
written in other languages. This can be done by multilingual indexing,
such as is done in ECO, but this is expensive, and automatic translation
and indexing tools are likely to have to be applied here. It is worth noting
in this context that assigning useful subject descriptors in one language
can facilitate access to the material by a searcher using who is not familiar
with the language.</p>

<p>As digital collections become more common, there is likely to be demand
for the search interface be standardised so that users can search a wide
range of collections through the same interface. Z39.50 client server approach
has been proposed as a solution to this, although none of the digital libraries
surveyed appeared to be Z39.50 compliant. In the 1980’s the Common Command
Language (Klemperer 1987) was proposed as a solution to the problem of
differing commands on different on-line search services, but did not achieve
success, partly because adherence to a standard risked limiting the development
of new search features. The same problem is likely to be an issue in digital
library development.</p>

<p>The digital library research community has achieved a wide measure of
success in a short time. However there are still lessons to be gained from
the "traditional" digital libraries, the on-line search services.</p>

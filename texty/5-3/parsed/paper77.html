	    <h2> 1. Motivation and method </h2>
		
	    <p>The aim with this project is to look at the information culture in Finnish
	    insurance companies. The project is concerned with the internal information
	    flow, how is a rich information culture and a functioning knowledge creation
	    connected to successful performance? Further the value of information and
	    the flexibility of the information culture are examined. What does the
	    information profiles look like in different information processes and how
	    is the information communicated?</p>
		
	    <p>	    For the <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>study the information culture is evaluated through interviews
	    in 15 Finnish insurance companies. Managers on the top level, the marketing
	    level and the production level are interviewed in order to picture the
	    information flow, the information communication, knowledge creation, information
	    channels, IT, <span>attitudes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> etc. That is to picture the organisation information
	    culture. The material is quite representative for the whole insurance business
	    market in Finland.</p>
	    <p>
	    The insurance <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>is a well-defined group of companies in Finland. The
	    insurance <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>is of interest for this study because it is an information
	    intensive field, and the persons working in such an organisation are often
	    specialists and experts. The activities and products of insurance companies
	    are built on specialist knowledge and therefore it is interesting to look
	    at how the information culture is structured in this field.</p>
	    <p>
	    The theoretical <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>for this project is concerned with organisational
	    aspects as organisational culture and information culture. Further the research
	    about knowledge-creation and social intelligence is of great interest in
	    order to picture the context for the internal information flows. The research
	    about information needs and behaviour is important in order to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>with
	    <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>aspects, feelings of uncertainty and complex environmental situations.
	    In this organisational study human aspects are involved and also the individuals
	    and the single situations must be evaluated. The starting point for the
	    <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>evaluation of the information culture is the factors concerning
	    competitive advantage as they are described in the literature. Success factors
	    of businesses are also taken into con0eration.</p>
	    <p>
	    The project is situated in the information management <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>within the
	    information science field. According to <a href="#Ingwersen">Ingwersen
	    </a>(1995) the information management <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>is concerned with studies in
	    information in human, <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>communication <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> effectiveness of
	    information transfer and the relations between user and information. Be0es
	    that this project is also looking at the relations between information and
	    generator. Most important though is to look at the information from the process-
	    and knowledge aspects within the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>organisations.</p>
	    <p>
	    The <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis is carried out through the case-study method (multiple
	    case studies). The case study method is chosen in order to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the entities
	    in the material (described as stage 1-4 below) with many variables. Case
	    studies are used f.e. to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>a particular set of events in a believable
	    manner where the events are put into a social or historical complexity
	    (<a href="#Andersen">Andersen </a>&nbsp;1997, 19;
	    <a href="#Gummesson">Gummesson</a>&nbsp;1988,&nbsp;75). In this study the
	    theory is used as a base and a tool for the interpretation of the material
	    while it is important to have a clear theoretical model as a frame when the
	    research process and analyse has so few standardised rules
	    (<a href="#Andersen">Andersen</a> 1997, 20).</p>
		
	    <h2>2. Empirical analysis</h2>
		
	    <p>	    The bases for the <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>study are the in-depth-interviews made in 15
	    insurance businesses in Finland. Two or three persons per company were
	    interviewed and there are 40 interviews all together. The analysis is conducted
	    through five stages.</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>Information environment</li>
	      <li>Information as a resource</li>
	      <li>Work processes</li>
	      <li>Innovation</li>
	      <li>Business success</li>
	    </ol>
		
	    <p> First the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>is analysed in order to group the companies according
	    to the openness and reserveness in the information <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> With the
	    material grouped into the different categories the analysis may continue
	    with a narrower study of the information as a resource, and the role of
	    information and knowledge in different activities. The results may also be
	    compared to the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>success according to the annual reports. So far
	    the first stage is completed.</p>
		
	    <h3>2.1. Information environment</h3>
		
	    <p> In this context it is interesting to look at the social intelligence at the
	    organisational level. <a href="#Cronin">Cronin and Davenport </a>(1993) define
	    the SI as a process where the organisation <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> interprets
	    the <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and frames its own opinions. SI is a multi-faceted concept composed
	    of activities (locating, validating, analysis), content (tacit knowledge,
	    rumour), and capabilities (information infrastructure, literacy). The raw
	    material is publications, reports, oral texts etc. but the important part
	    is to be able to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the material. SI is about life-long learning where
	    the objects of the research become active <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of passive
	    (<a href="#Ginman2">Ginman </a>1995). This also corresponds with the thoughts
	    in the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>literature on knowledge management
	    (<a href="#Prahalad2">Prahalad &amp; Hamel </a>1994; <a href="#Senge">Senge
	    </a>1994). The theories of <a href="#Nonaka">Nonaka</a> (1994) about the
	    company knowledge and how it is created have a lot in common with the theories
	    of SI. <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>is a multi-dimensional concept and Nonaka points out a
	    distinction between information and knowledge. Information is a flow of messages,
	    while knowledge is created and organised from this flow, and at the same
	    time anchored in the information holder's conviction and understanding. Knowledge
	    is created through a spiral of <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>between tacit and explicit knowledge.
	    The individual is the most important part in the organisational knowledge
	    processing, it is an <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>between information and experience and
	    rationality. From the organisational point of view, the teamwork and the
	    middle management have a special role in this <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
		
	    <p> With the SI and the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>knowledge creation in mind, it is important
	    also to look at the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>or the culture where this knowledge production
	    and social <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>take place. It is therefore interesting to look at
	    the company information culture (IC). IC is difficult to define. Information
	    culture is often described in the frames of information technology (IT).
	    <a href="#Davenport">Davenport</a> (1994) says that many executives think
	    they <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>all information problems with buying IT-equipment. Anyway, effective
	    information management is how people use<b> </b>information, not machines.
	    IT is more as a part of the information culture, but there is an interactive
	    role of IT and information culture.</p>
		
	    <p>	    Further the information culture is a part of the whole organisational culture.
	    Valuation and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>towards information are depending on the organisation's
	    <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#Ginman1">Ginman </a>1987, 222). Further, it is also
	    about personal <span>attitudes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> the information profile must be confirmed so that
	    the executive becomes aware of the importance of the information
	    (<a href="#Ginman1">Ginman</a> 1987, 231). The information culture can be
	    seen as the SI on a corporate or organisational level as
	    <a href="#Cronin">Cronin &amp; Davenport</a> (1993) describe it. The information
	    culture is also about formal information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>(technology), common knowledge,
	    individual information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>(attitudes), and information <span>ethics</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> Information

	    the gap between what officially has happened and what really happened
	    (<a href="#Ginman1">Ginman </a>1987, 24).</p>
	    <p>
	    In order to study the information culture it could be an advantage to look
	    at companies from the same field. <a href="#Gronhaug">Gr&ouml;nhaug &amp;
	    Haukedal</a> (1988) give an example on two companies in the shipping business
	    where they have the same <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>with same trends, risks etc. It was
	    shown that the companies interpreted the environmental impulses very differently,
	    they made very different <span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> and therefore their results were also
	    very different from each other. It was <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>that the internal factors
	    affected the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>behaviour more than the external factors, that is the
	    information culture, the <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and the <span>traditions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the company.</p>
	    <p>
	    With a study concerning <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>organisations, their activities and <span>performance</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>
	    the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>success factors are also of importance. Business success factors
	    are difficult to clearly define. It is about individuality, the learning
	    organisation, communication and innovation. It is important to have a deep
	    understanding of the own company and ability to see the own possibilities
	    in the given frames. The knowledge that the individuals in the company have
	    is pointed out and it is also important to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>with the environmental
	    circumstances effectively. It is about information; to be aware of the

	<h4>The key for analysis</h4>
	
	    <p>	    With the research literature as a frame the key for analysis is created with
	    this frame as a starting point. According to the literature the information
	    <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in an organisation may be described through several factors.
	    For this study there are eight different factors that are analysed in order
	    to picture the information <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> The factors are:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>Bigger changes in the organisation or its activities</li>
	      <li>Co-operation between units</li>
	      <li>Teamwork</li>
	      <li>Communication and feedback</li>
	      <li>Training</li>

	    with a scale from 1-5 representing the following levels of openness in the
	    information environment: 1. closed 2. fairly closed 3. middle 4. fairly open
	    5. open. Most of the companies are <span>naturally</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in the middle.</p>

	    The overall picture of the companies with a closed <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>is that they
	    struggle with an old company culture where the open <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>are not <span>central</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>
	    Common for these companies is also the fact that their aims are formulated
	    in round words and informed at a few occasions. With fuzzy corporational
	    aims the possibilities for shared <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>are poor and it reflects also the
	    openness and active attitude to co-operation, communication and creativity.</p>
	    <p>
	    Training and teamwork may have a more active role and it may be because it
	    is something that is very much discussed in the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>world today. It
	    is also a way of improving the company culture and co-operation attitudes
	    because the closed companies are all aware of their problems.</p>
	    <p>
	    In the open companies the co-operation and the communication on corporate
	    aims are very <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span><span>supported</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> Co-operation is not only teamwork and this
	    is shown in these companies. The personnel seems to be more a part of the
	    organisation as individuals and the functioning teamwork, internal communication
	    and creativity is a result of many years work.</p>
		
	    <h3>2.2. Information as resource </h3>
		
	    <p>
	    Information must definitely be a resource for today's companies, because
	    they work in a turbulent <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and in order to adjust to new circumstances
	    they need knowledge about what is happening. The more you know about your
	    company and its <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the bigger the chances are to adjust to the changes.
	    <span>Sometimes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>it is necessary to revalue the processes in the company, reengineering,
	    and then look at the information needs and uses in the processes. The information
	    needs in the company vary very quickly and there is a lot of interpretation
	    of information. The information process needs to be organised by the top
	    management, but at the same time it must be remembered that it is a human
	    process and therefore needs flexibility. Information is a resource, but not
	    automatically. There must be a bigger context in order to gain from the
	    information.</p>
	    <p>
	    The literature says that both information and knowledge are valuable resources
	    for today's companies (<a href="#abel">Abel </a>1995;
	    <a href="#Ginman1">Ginman</a> 1987, <a href="#Ginman3">1993</a>;
	    <a href="#Koenig">Koenig </a>1998; <a href="#Owens">Owens</a> 1996). In this
	    project the role of information is analysed in connection with the human
	    capital, the intellectual capital, the knowledge resource and the conditions
	    for the knowledge and information.</p>
	    <p>
	    The frames for the companies' knowledge base can theoretically be studies
	    according to <a href="#Nonaka">Nonaka's </a>(1994) theories about the
	    organisational knowledge production and <a href="#Cronin">Cronin &amp;
	    Davenport's</a> (1993) theories about the social intelligence. According
	    to these theories it can be <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>that it is important to look at the
	    information user in a <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>perspective when the organisational information
	    culture is examined. It is also important to look at the result of the use
	    of information, which is how the organisation uses this knowledge (feedback).</p>
	    <p>
	    For this study the human capital is <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>into categories of creativity,
	    motivation and development (training). The intellectual capital is described
	    through the company's individuality and the role of the knowledge in the
	    company. Further the knowledge resource is pictured by the information
	    technology, the networks, communication and information management. The
	    conditions for the knowledge are described through restructuring, teamwork,
	    <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and social conditions.</p>
	    <p>
	    This stage is still in an active analysing phase, but it is possible to see
	    a pattern where the companies with a more passive information environment
	    have a higher rate of differentiation in their information organisation.
	    The more open companies have a <span>uniform</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and active work with creativity,
	    motivation and training. They seem to have a better ability to use their
	    knowledge base and an ability to use the individual's knowledge base.</p>
		
	    <h2>3. Conclusion and continuation of the project</h2>
	    <p>
	    The aim with this research project is to review the existing information
	    cultures in 15 Finnish insurance businesses. The study is conducted through
	    a <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>interview method and the present research phase is the analysis
	    of the material. The analysis is conducted through five stages concerning
	    1. the information <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> 2. information as resource, 3. work processes,

	    As a concluding remark it can be said that the companies are aware of the
	    importance of information and knowledge, but they admit that it is the most
	    difficult asset to manage. Hopefully this study could illuminate some aspects
	    on this management problem.</p>

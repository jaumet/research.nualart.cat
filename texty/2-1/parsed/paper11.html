<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This paper summarises some of the <span>principal</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>findings of a recent study <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of information 
usage by general medical practitioners (GPs) (<a href="#wood2">Wood et al., 1995a</a>).  The work was based on previous studies of the value and impact of information, these studies being undertaken in the corporate sector in Canada (<a href="#mars2">Marshall, 1993</a>) and in the health care sector in both the USA (<a href="#king">King, 1987</a>; <a href="#mars1">Marshall, 1992</a>) and the UK (<a href="#hepw">Hepworth and Urquhart, 1995</a>; Wood et al., 1995b, 1996).  The study used a critical 
incident <span>technique</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>similar to that employed in the Canadian and USA studies.  Twenty <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in-depth 
interviews were conducted with general practitioners (GPs) in the Trent Health Region (only one from 
each practice).  The <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> selected from two health districts, included large, <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and small 
<span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> fund-holding and non-fund-holding <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> and training and non-training <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> with 
some <span>representation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of those located in deprived and non-deprived (socio-economic) areas.
</p>
<p>The clinical study of <a href="#mars1">Marshall (1992)</a> focused on hospital physicians who have ready access to their organisations’ special libraries, which is not the case with general practitioners in the United Kingdom.  It was known from previous studies <a href="#wood2">(Wood et al., 1995b)</a> that GPs were likely to make little <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>use of libraries in their patient-related decision-making so a much broader approach was taken.  It was, however, a requirement of the project that the interview schedule incorporate certain of the questions included in earlier studies (<a href="#mars1">Marshall, 1992</a>, <a href="#mars2">1993</a>), to allow comparisons to be made with them.  These comparisons related specifically to three areas: the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information; its <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>value; and its value in the decision-making process.  Details of GPs’ general use of libraries were gathered separately.  
</p>
<h2>Characteristics of the participants and the critical incidents</h2>

<p>Of the 120 <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>contacted 38 expressed willingness to participate.  Lack of time was the most 
common reason given for non-participation, although some GPs stated that they had decided not to 
participate in further studies, and several others would have taken part had a financial incentive been 
<span>offered</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>  The participants varied greatly in the <span>length</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of their professional experience: <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of them 
had been in practice for less than 5 years; four for 5-10 years; <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>for 11-15 years; and the remaining 
nine for between 16 and 30 years.  
</p>
<p>The participants were required to state the last time they had <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>information to assist in the 
decision-making process related specifically to a patient care problem.  In fourteen of the cases, the 
information had been required less than one week before; in eight it had been required one to two 
weeks before, and in one it had been required upto one month before.  The remaining four GPs based 
their responses on information <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>more than one month previously, but it is likely that they had 
misunderstood what was meant by ‘information’, since: one stated during the course of the interview 
that she had telephoned a Regional Medical Officer the previous day; one reads extensively and is 
involved in the area’s Vocational Training Scheme; one rang an Orthopaedist the afternoon of the 
interview for advice about a patient; and the last uses MIMS ((Monthly Index of Medical Specialities) 
"very regularly".  Several GPs commented that they needed information most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>about drugs, 
with MIMS, the ABPI Data Compendium or the BNF (British National Formulary) being consulted.  
These were generally con0ered to be excellent, regularly-updated sources but there is no single, 
standard <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>source for drug information.
</p>

<p>GPs were asked to give <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the patient problem presented and the specific types of information 
<span>sought</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> as <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in Table 1.  When the interviews were analysed it was found that  in <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>cases, 
although the information was important for patient care, it was not related to clinical decisions but was 
of an administrative nature.  These cases are discussed later in the paper. </p>

<p>Earlier studies (Marshall, 1992, 1993) have <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the impact of information provided by special libraries in the clinical and corporate settings.  However, for reasons that have been discussed already, this study concentrated on the information <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>by the GP himself (herself) from a pertinent <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of his or her choosing.  </p>

<p>All except one of the GPs were satisfied with the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information, which was otherwise 
con0ered to be relevant, <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and current.  The one GP who was not satisfied with the relevancy 
of the information was unsure of the <span>accuracy</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the television <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>his patient had been watching, 
which had stimulated her enquiry.  Approximately two thirds of the participants con0ered that the 
information had <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>value in the terms used in this study.  Almost all GPs agreed that the 
information did contribute to <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>patient care; of those who were not satisfied one made the 
following remarks:</p>

<blockquote>"...they told me that there was <span>absolutely</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>nothing they could do or <span>suggest</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> and nothing that I could do that would make things any better.  So it was really a very mechanistic approach 
which was of no use to me whatsoever in managing my patient.  Anything I suggested they 
said wouldn’t work, so it was extremely negative."</blockquote>  

<p>Fewer than half of the participants stated that the information saved time.  In many cases the process of accessing the relevant information was time-consuming; once the information was to hand most of the 
GPs were able to make the appropriate decisions and some stated that it would save time in the <span>future</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>  
The answers to this question were <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span><span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>by the GPs’ willingness, or otherwise, to 
delegate the information-seeking task; only two participants had delegated the task to practice staff, 
with both of these tasks being requests for the results of <span>laboratory</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>tests.
</p>

<h4>Impact on decision-making: was the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>handled differently?</h4>

<p>These data <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the measurable impact of the information; the GP might have felt more confident 
having received the information but a more significant aspect is the extent to which the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>was 
handled differently.  Of the 20 GPs, the responses were as follows: definitely yes: 12; <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>yes: 2; 
<span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>no: 3; definitely no: 3.  The information thus had an influence on the GP’s handling of the 
<span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in no less than 14 of the 20 cases; of these 14, four GPs said the changes were of some 
importance to the patient, six of <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>importance and four of great importance.</p>

<h4>Impact of the information: changes in patient care.</h4>

<p>The most important elements in an impact study are whether the information <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>makes a 
difference to the decisions made and whether it allows the recipient to advance the  process more 
effectively.  The next <span>table</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>(Table 4), which is adapted from that used in the Rochester (USA) study 
(Marshall, 1992), <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the changes reported by the 14 GPs who reported that the information had 
brought about a change in the handling of the patient.  The results show the GPs were able to provide 
better patient care because of the information.  Three GPs changed two aspects of patient care and 
<span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>changed one aspect of care.</p>

<h4>Impact of the information: avoidance of negative effects on patient care</h4>

<p>Table 5, which was adapted from the clinical study by <a href="#mars1">Marshall (1992)</a>, illustrates both the negative and positive effects afforded by the use of the information.  The <span>table</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>also shows that in several instances the information obtained enabled the GP to avoid having to ask the patient to undergo additional <span>tests</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> referral or even admission to hospital.  Even more significant is that in two cases the patient recovered when s/he might not have done and that in 11 instances the health <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the patient improved when it might not otherwise have done.  Several GPs were keen to stress that the 
patient’s <span>psychological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>state was just as important as their physical health and that the information 
gained had had a positive effect on this.</p>

<h4>Importance of the availability of different information sources</h4>

<p><a href="#table2">Table 2</a> illustrates the variety of information sources used by the GPs in the decision-making <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>  Seventeen used one <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>only to satisfy the information need, one used two different sources and two GPs used four sources.  Colleagues, both within and <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the Practice, were the most popular sources of information.  The most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>used sources of ‘internal’ information were the BNF, ABPI and MIMS that offer drug-related information. </p>

<p>In this impact study none of the respondents had <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>information from an external medical library 
but one GP had <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to his practice library.  The general use of libraries by GPs was <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>
and this is con0ered further below.</p>

<h4>The Impact Of Non-Medical Information</h4>

<p>Seven of the critical incidents described <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to be concerned with seeking administrative 
information and did not involve any clinical decision-making.  Of these, five incidents required <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>
of hospital referral <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>(four of them for urgent referrals) from hospital staff, one required the 
availability of a particular drug at a particular pharmacy from the pharmacist, and one required a 
<span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>Services protocol for admission to a home from the duty officer.  Only one GP delegated the 
task of obtaining information for hospital referrals to the practice staff.</p>

<p>The <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>impact of the non-medical information was in its contribution to higher <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>care, with 
three GPs stating that the information was instrumental in enabling the patient to recover more 
quickly.  This serves to illustrate the importance of, and necessity for, <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>procedural information 
to accompany <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>medical information (Table 6).</p>

<p>In con0ering whether the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>was handled differently, the majority opinion was in the negative 
and as such it <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>reflected the fact that the medical decision had already been made.  The three 
GPs who had handled (or would handle) the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>differently each stated that the changes were of 
<span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>importance for the patient, e.g.: &quot;<em>it brought his appointment forward by ten, eleven weeks</em>&quot;</p> 

<p>Ready access to such non-medical information is of vital importance to the GP’s management of the 
case.</p>

<h3>GPs’ use of external library sources</h3>

<p>One of the participants remarked that: &quot;general practitioners hardly ever visit libraries, they don’t get lots of other publications except maybe the BMJ, and other journals because they’re free&quot;
</p>

<p>reflecting the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of previous studies (<a href="#chil">Childs, 1988</a>; <a href="#elay">Elayyan, 1988</a>).  GPs do not use a library for immediate patient care problems but the majority (26 of the 27 participants) stated that they read the British Medical Journal (BMJ).  It would appear that the library is con0ered to be a <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of books and journals to be accessed when the GP has time, rather than as an information service.</p>

<p>All GPs in this study were asked to state the last time that they had used an external library in 
connection with their work.  Of the twelve GPs who had used an external library within the previous 
six months: <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>had used hospital medical libraries; three the Post-graduate Centres attached to 
hospitals; one the Health Authority library; and one the RCGP library.  The librarian was involved in 
obtaining information in six cases, one of which was to arrange a <span>CD-ROM</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>training session and two 
were related to telephone requests.  Nine GPs visited the library, two telephoned, and one sent a postal 
enquiry.  The GPs sought: <span>CD-ROM</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>training; literature searches for new titles; and medical literature 
searches related to a non-urgent patient case, related to litigation, in preparation for a talk, for <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>a paper, and for researching a project.</p>


<p>None of the examples of library use was <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>related to an immediate patient problem;  some were 
in connection with the treatment of specific illnesses, some with continuing <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and some with 
research.  Contact with the library was rated as ‘Very successful’ by six GPs and ‘Successful’ by a 
further six GPs.  An additional three GPs had used library services within the previous twelve months, 
one when he was studying for an examination, one for the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of post-graduate <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> and 
one in connection with an audit he was conducting.  The availability of an efficient, effective external 
library service is obviously highly valued by some GPs. &quot;<em>One of the best things for me is having contact with libraries.</em>&quot;

<p>One interesting comment from a participant was:</p>

<blockquote>"I only use it (the library) occasionally, so...I don’t know my way around...and I’m conscious 
of (a) not appearing an idiot and (b) <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>up...the librarian’s time...It would be...good to ring 
somebody up in the library and say "Can you dig me out a few bits and pieces on.."...you’d be 
really grateful and possibly willing to pay for it"</blockquote>

<p>Several of the participants who had not used an external library in connection with their work during 
the previous six months were avid readers of journals, had <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>interests and were keen on 
information technology in medicine.  Physical access to the nearest medical library, especially 
parking, was regarded as a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>problem by several GPs.</p>

<p>Seventeen of the GPs were members of the BMA; of these, only one mentioned using the BMA library 
and now prefers to use the <span>CD-ROM</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>version of MEDLINE.  Eighteen were members of the RCGP but 
only one GP mentioned using their library recently and one stated that membership was "not that 
useful".  When <span>speaking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>about their <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>habits GPs used <span>terminology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>such as ‘indulgence’, 
‘privileges’, and <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and discussing in ‘protected time’.  This <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of language may <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the 
view that the opportunity for <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>is regarded as a luxury, rather than an integral part of a GP’s 
working <span>day</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>In this study the GPs were asked to describe the last time they had needed to seek information to help 
with the care of a patient.  Almost all could describe an event within the last week, e.g., <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>out the 
arrangements for a particular referral, checking on the most <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>drug for a child, reviewing a case, 
checking if a patient had to come off particular medication prior to an operation.  <span>Sometimes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the 
information was needed whilst the patient was with the GP. The information was obtained mainly by 
telephoning hospital staff, including consultants, but other sources included MIMS, drug compendia, 
the practice library, meetings and colleagues.  In about two-thirds of the cases the information 
obtained changed the way the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>was handled.  In about <span>one-third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of cases, the information 
obtained changed the <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>tests</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> drugs, post-hospital care, or advice given to the patient.</p>

<p>In a few cases the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>diagnosis was changed because of the information obtained.   In some cases 
GPs also reported that the information they obtained meant that they did not send the patient for 
additional <span>tests</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>or other procedures, refer the patient to a consultant, or arrange hospital admission.  
Over half the GPs said that the health <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the patient had improved when it otherwise might not 
have done.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>few of the GPs said that the patient recovered when s/he might not have done or that the 
patient recovered more quickly (this was related to non-medical information).</p>

<p>Information is often needed immediately for individual patient care.  Already some GP <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>

indications.  Computer-based information <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> such as Personalised Medical Reference 
(<a href="#mcmo">McMorran et al., 1995</a>) which aims to encapsulate <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>medical knowledge and the Oxford <span>Handbook</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of Medicine, will become more generally available but the extent to which the contents of these are research based will vary.  Some GPs may choose also to have MEDLINE or other databases on <span>CD-ROM</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in the practice or to access MEDLINE via the BMA but will still need the services of librarians to enable them to learn effective searching <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span><span>documents</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>For some of the critical incidents, evidence-based or research-based information was not needed but 
for others evidence of medical, drug, or care provider <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>was required.  It appears, however, 
that few of the GPs <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>used such information although the consultants, and other hospital staff 
consulted by the GPs, could have been basing their advice on published research or other evidence.  
For this reason additional questions were asked about the GPs’ use of information sources.  When 
asked to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the importance of sources of information over half the GPs con0ered colleagues in 
hospitals important.  Other GPs con0ered <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>books, their own colleagues, <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and 
courses/meetings as important.  The only journal which was read by almost all the GPs was the BMJ.  
The only other publications most of the GPs said they saw or read were books, <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>publications and 
drug company leaflets.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>few had carried out a MEDLINE <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>or had one done for them.  Practice 
libraries, where they existed, <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to be well used, especially for looking at journals. </p>

<p>As these results show, human sources were con0ered to be more important than literary sources in 
the context of immediate patient care problems.  In the six months prior to the study less than half of 
the GPs had used a medical library, other than their practice library, and <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>had not used an 
external library for many years.  Physical access to those libraries attached to hospitals was a problem 
in several cases;  this may be improved with technological changes, although some GPs were 
concerned about the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>capacity to avail themselves of such services.  GPs do use 
libraries for research, continuing <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and non-immediate reasons, but there seems to be a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of 
awareness of <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>what services are available, and in some cases a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge of how to use 
those services.  The service <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>by the Sheffield Health Authority in circulating the <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of new 
publications is commendable, but only one of the participants in this study availed himself of it.  More 
GPs are entitled to access the libraries and information services of the BMA and RCGP than use them.

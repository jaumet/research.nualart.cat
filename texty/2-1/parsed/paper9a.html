<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The first scholarly journal, <i>Journal des Scavans</i>, was published as a new <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of communication in 1665, and was soon <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by the <i>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society</i> <a href="#osburn">(Osburn, 1984)</a>.  For more than three <span>centuries</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the journal has played a pivotal role in the creation and transmission of knowledge by serving as the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>medium of scholarly communication, and has remained <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>unchanged in form and function over its lifetime.  Science as we know it is scarcely imaginable without the scholarly journal. </p>

<p>Despite its benefits to science and scholarship, the paper journal system has been subject to much <span>criticism</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  Deficiencies noted by some authors include perceived problems with the peer review process (that it suppresses new ideas, favors authors from prestigious institutions, and causes undue delays in the publication process), high costs that are escalating faster than the rate of inflation, and <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of selectivity.  Spiraling costs and long publication delays are perhaps the most serious of these criticisms.
<p>At the same time that the costs of producing the paper journal have increased sharply, developments in <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and communications technology have accelerated.  And of course we now have the dramatic explosion of the World Wide Web.  Technology increasingly <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of using computers and communication networks to create alternative electronic forms of the conventional paper journal.  It is possible that these new forms of computer-based communication will transform the scholarly communication system.  There is much debate and discussion concerning how the <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the various participants in the scholarly communication process, including libraries, may be redefined in the process <a href="#meyer">(Meyer, 1993)</a>.</p>

<p>Although electronic journals (or e-journals) have been under development since 1976 <a href="#turoff">(Turoff and Hiltz, 1982)</a>, e-journals in their non-experimental phase did not begin until the 1990s, with a few exceptions.  The first peer-reviewed electronic, full-text e-journal including graphics was <i>Online Journal of Current <span>Clinical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Trials</i> (OJCCT) <a href="#keyhani">(Keyhani, 1993)</a>.  In the most recently published <span>list</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and one of the few research projects <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>e-journals, <a href="#hitchcock">Hitchcock, Carr, & Hall (1996)</a> identified 115 scholarly, peer-reviewed e-journals in science and technology, and there are many more in the social science and humanities.  These constitute the first wave of what are likely to be many more scholarly e-journals to come.</p>

<p>Ann Okerson <span>wrote</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> "One can fantasize endlessly about electronic 'journals,' but without active authorship and readership there is nothing" (quoted in <a href="#collins">Collins and Berge (1994)</a>).  We would add "use" to authorship and readership.  If e-journals are not used, they cannot play an important role in scholarly communication.  There has been much discussion and <span>speculation</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in the literature about perceived advantages and disadvantages of e-journals, and about problems and issues related to their development and use.  Such <span>speculation</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is necessary and important.  The present study is aimed at gathering hard data regarding the readership, use, and impact of e-journals.  What <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of e-journals are being published, and how often?  What impact are e-journals having on the scholarly communities they are serving?  To what extent are scholars and researchers aware of, <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by, using, and building their own work on research published in e-journals? </p>

<p>The present study assesses the impact of scholarly e-journals by examining the artifacts of scholarly communication--the journal article and its references.  In bibliometric studies, citation analysis is a well-known <span>technique</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that has a long history in studies of scholarly communication <a href="#borgman">(Borgman, 1990)</a>.  As an artifact of scholarly communication, citations reveal formal communication patterns and scholarly impact.  The <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>advantages of citation analysis are its high reliability and unobtrusiveness.  Several standards for citing electronic publications have been promulgated (<a href="#li">Li & Crane, 1993</a>; <a href="#walker">Walker, 1995</a>; <a href="#brown">Brown, 1995</a>).</p>  

<p>This research provides hard citation data concerning the impact of e-journals on the conduct of research and scholarship.  At another level, publishers of e-journals can gain some information regarding use by recording the number of subscriptions to an e-journal or the number of times articles are accessed or downloaded from host <span>servers</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  While these <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of data provide useful indicators of one type of use, they do not measure the extent to which e-journal articles are playing a role in the scholarly and research process, that is, in the advancement of knowledge.  While the meaning of citations can certainly be debated, what is clear is that they <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>an influence or impact of some kind on the author of the citing article. </p> 

<p>The <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of this study are to:</p> 

<ol>
<li>assess the <span>accuracy</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and completeness of citations to e-journals</li>
<li>identify the extent to which scholars publishing in both print and electronic journals cite e-journals and other e-publications</li>
<li>identify fields in which researchers actively use scholarly e-journals</li>
<li>identify highly cited e-journals and articles in e-journals in these fields</li>
<li>record and analyze interesting demographic <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and access problems of e-journals.</li>
</ol>

<p>The last stated purpose deserves further comment.  Although it was not originally part of our study to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>demographic data, we found as the research progressed that we were learning information of great interest to us that had little to do with the referencing of e-journals.  As part of our original research plan, in order to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the references of articles in e-journals it was necessary that each e-journal in the population be accessed and articles and other information about the journal to be downloaded and printed for analysis.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>useful byproduct of the study has resulted from a study of these data, which revealed several interesting demographic <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and access problems associated with the population of e-journals.  Because of space limitations, only a few of these can be discussed here.</p>

<h2>Summary of methods</h2>

<p>The method <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in the first part of this study is  one of defining and drawing appropriate <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of e-journals, obtaining data from printed documentation and e-journal articles, conducting descriptive <span>analyses</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and reporting the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>tables</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and prose.  In the second part of the study, <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>published by  the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) are used to conduct cited <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>searches and other citation <span>analyses</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  The following section describes how the e-journal <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for study.</p>

<p>Our interest in this research was on scholarly electronic journals that <span>publish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>articles reporting scholarship or research that are refereed or peer-reviewed.  Other types of publications--newsletters, zines, and the like, were not subjects of study.  We chose to use two published directories that include data on electronic journals: Mecklermedia's <i>Internet World's on Internet 94</i> <a href="#mecklermedia">(Mecklermedia, 1994)</a> [Note: the 1995 edition was not available at the time of the study], and the Association of Research Libraries' <i>Directory of electronic journals, newsletters and academic discussion lists</i> <a href="#okerson">(Okerson, 1995)</a>. E-journals selected from the ARL directory were taken from the section entitled "Electronic journals, magazines, and zines" and identified there as "peer-reviewed."  e-journals selected from the Mecklermedia directory were taken from the section entitled "Electronic journals and newsletters" and identified there as "refereed."  All e-journals meeting these criteria became members of the <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  The two lists were combined and <span>duplicates</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were removed.  There were 134 e-journals in the final <span>list</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  Four titles were <span>eliminated</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>from the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for various reasons, and one title was <span>added</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> for a refined initial <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of 131 e-journals. </p> 

<p>Next, recent articles and other documentation (journal <span>description</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> instructions for potential authors, statement of scope, etc.) from each of the e-journals were downloaded or otherwise obtained and printed for examination.  The access and demographic study was conducted on all 131 e-journals in the refined initial <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 

<p>For the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>study, we had two criteria for selecting the journals to be studied from the 131 e-journals in the refined <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  First, the e-journal must have published one or more articles that reported the results of research or scholarship.  Second, the e-journal be peer-reviewed or refereed articles, as described in the e-journal documentation.  Many e-journals were <span>eliminated</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>because they <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to meet the first criterion.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>few were removed because of the absence of any statement in the e-journal documentation indicating that it was peer-reviewed or refereed.  This characteristic, as well as all the other demographic information related to the e-journals, was taken <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>from the e-journals.  There were several instances where the data in the two directories (both providing self-reported <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>data) did not <span>agree</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with the information provided in the e-journals themselves.</p>

<p>To be included in the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>study, an article must, in our judgment, have reported the results of research or scholarship and must have cited at least one <span>reference</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  Our <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of articles for the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>study was defined as the last four available scholarly, peer-reviewed articles of each of the 77 scholarly e-journals.  If one or more issues or articles of the year 1995 were not available, one or more issues from 1994 and, if necessary, 1993, were used.</p>

<p>For the cited work study, the population of seventy-seven e-journals used in the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>study defined the initial <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  However, in order for an e-journal article to be cited, especially in a print publication, the lag time in conventional print publishing must be con0ered.  One must provide some time for articles to be read, to influence a researcher or scholar in some way and thus become part of a study in progress,  and <span>eventually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to be cited in the published article reporting the results of that study.  For this reason, the cited work study was done only on scholarly electronic journals that commenced publication in 1993 or earlier.  There were thirty-nine such journals.  Table 1 summarizes the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the three e-journal <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>used in the study. </p>

<h3>Subjects covered</h3>

<p>We assigned the 131 e-journals in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(consisting of all known e-journals at the time the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>was selected) to broad subject categories that coincided in most cases with university departments or professional <span>schools</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>   Subject categories could not be determined for <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>e-journals.  Although we were fortunate to have access to some fee-based journals, thanks to temporary passwords supplied by <a href="http://www.oclc.org/">OCLC, Inc.</a>, we did not have access to three other fee-based e-journals in the <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  Also, three e-journals could not be accessed at all, either by using the information in the two directories or by using other means, such as Internet <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>tools</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  Finally, the language of one e-journal was Polish, and we did not attempt to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a translation.  Since we required all of our demographic data to come from the e-journals themselves, rather than <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>sources, these <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>journals were <span>eliminated</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>from the <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  Save for a very few exceptions, then, the remaining demographic data are for the 124 e-journals to which we were able to gain access.
<p><a href="#table2">Table 2</a> shows the subject categories with highest frequencies.  Education, literature, and mathematics were the top three categories, with library and information science a somewhat surprising fourth, with <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>e-journals.  There were five e-journals under the heading of religious studies.  We were also somewhat surprised at some of the subject categories with relatively low frequencies -- for example, physics, <span>biology</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  engineering, and sociology with only one or two representatives each.  Of course, since the publication of the ARL and Mecklermedia directories we used to select our <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> many more e-journals in these subject areas have <span>appeared</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> coinciding with the explosion of the World Wide Web.  Our demographic data <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the state of affairs as of June, 1995, and can be taken as a benchmark, against which <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>studies of electronic journals can be compared.</p>

<p>Many new e-journals have evidently arisen from an introspective con0eration of the new communication media themselves, and with a <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with how they will affect society and traditional disciplines and communication patterns.  <span>Computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>science, communication, and the broad subject we called "information technology, media, and society" are examples.</p>  

<p>A final way to characterize the subjects of the e-journals in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is to classify them into the traditional four broad areas of scholarship and research in the university: sciences, social sciences, humanities, and professional.  <a href="#table3">Table 3</a> summarizes a breakdown of subjects into these four <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>categories.  While we might have guessed that the sciences and possibly the professions would be most heavily <span>represented</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> this was not the case.  The four categories are <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>equal in size.  Whatever the motivation may be for launching an e-journal, it is apparently <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by scientists, social scientists, humanist scholars, and professionals alike.</p>  

<h3>Scholarly, peer-reviewed e-journals</h3>

<p>The <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>purpose of this research was to study the effects of scholarly, peer-reviewed e-journals on formal scholarly and scientific communication, as <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by cited references.  For the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>study and cited work study it was necessary to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and examine individual issues of the e-journals in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to identify which met our <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>criteria.  These criteria were that the e-journal must have published at least one article reporting the results of research or scholarship must be refereed or peer-reviewed, as stated in the documentation provided by the e-journal (corresponding to what is usually the front-matter in a print journal). </p>

<h3>Media of publication</h3>

<p>Scientific and scholarly journals are today being published in many media: <span>CD-ROM</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> floppy <span>disk</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> on <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>networks such as the Internet, and of course, print.  The literature has tended to use the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>e-journal -- short for electronic journal -- to refer to networked journals but not other forms of electronic journals (on floppy <span>disk</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> etc.).  We have used the same <span>terminology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in this report, though technically it is at best potentially misleading and at worst incorrect.</p>

<p>Most (nearly three quarters) of the e-journals in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>started as an original publication &ndash; they began their lives in electronic form.  Exactly one-fourth of the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>began and continue as print journals.  That is, they exist in two <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>forms, print and electronic.  And in three known cases &ndash; <a href="http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/MODAL/modal.html"><i>Modal Analysis</i></a>, [Note: the rights to <em>Modal Analysis</em> were bought by <span>Sage</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Science Publishers and the journal ceased publication at the end of 1996. <em>Ed.</em>]<a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/journals/EH/"><i>Essays  in History</i></a> , and <a href="http://www.joe.org/"><i>Journal of Extension</i></a>, the print version has been replaced by an electronic version.

<p>Several models have been developed for the relationship between print journals and their electronic counterparts.  (See <a href="#table6">Table 6</a>.)  The <a href="http://cjtcs.cs.uchicago.edu/"><i>Chicago Journal of Theoretical <span>Computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Science</i></a>  and other e-journals will provide individual articles in paper form, though the journals themselves are not published in a paper version.  The <a href="http://www.studyfinance.com/jfsd/"><i>Journal of Financial and Strategic Decisions</i></a>  calls its e-journal "<span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to" the print journal, by which is meant that the electronic version is the ASCII format and does not accurately <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the print version. [<strong>Note</strong>: the Journal ceased publication with the Fall 2000 issue. <em>Ed.</em>] <a href="http://www.econ.uiuc.edu/~slavrev/index1.html"><i>Slavic Review</i></a>  publishes its electronic version a few months after the print version has <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(called a &quot;postprint edition&quot;).  <i><a href="http://info.lib.uh.edu/pr/pacsrev.html">Public-Access <span>Computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Systems Review</a> (PACS Review)</i>  has published at least two <span>volumes</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in book form, many months after the appearance of the electronic version.

<h3>Pricing Arrangements</h3>

<p>Whether there exists a <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for a given e-journal is not as simple a question as it may first appear.  Questions and <span>distinctions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>not always made for print journals become important for an interpretation of the meaning of cost <span>figures</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  For example: </p>

<ul><li>Is there a cost distinction between providing access to current issues versus archival issues?</li>	
<li>Is there a print counterpart of the e-journal?</li>
<li>Is the e-journal included with membership in a society?</li></ul>

<p>Clearly the answers to these questions will be important information needed to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the cost, if any, of an e-journal, as well as the meaning of pricing trends.  We identified eight different categories of e-journals in the <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> depending on the answers to these questions.  Table 7 condenses the eight categories into just two: e-journals in which all issues are <span>free</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and e-journals for which some form of fee exists.  For nearly nine out of ten e-journals in the <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> all issues are <span>free</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  And in some of the remaining e-journals, there is no fee for some <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of access.  For example, <a href="http://nosferatu.cas.usf.edu/JAC/index.html"><i>JAC Online</i></a>, a journal of <span>composition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>theory <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by the Association of Teachers of Advanced Composition and the University of South Florida, <span>charges</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a fee to view the current issue, but there is no <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to examine archival issues.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>chi-square <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the hypothesis that there is no relationship between pricing arrangement and whether the e-journal is peer-reviewed could not be rejected (p=.487). </p>

<h2>Reference study</h2>

<p>The purpose of the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>study was to analyze the references from a <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of articles in scholarly e-journals, to measure the extent to which authors of e-journal articles are currently citing e-journals and other online sources.  Such authors can be assumed to be more knowledgeable about and sympathetic to the electronic media than <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>authors.  Thus the results of the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>study should provide a kind of upper bound on the current influence of e-journals and other electronic publications on scholarly communication.</p>

<p>Among the 77 scholarly and peer-reviewed e-journals in the <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> two were fee-based e-journals for which we had no subscription<a href="#note4">[4]</a>.  These e-journals were <span>eliminated</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>from the <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  In addition, <i>Radioscientist ON-LINE</i>,  published by the New Zealand National Committee for the International Union of Radio Science, included only one article, which had no <span>reference</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> so it was also <span>eliminated</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>from the <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  Therefore, the final <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>size for the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>study was reduced to 74.</p>

<p>To examine their references, we retrieved and printed the last four available scholarly, peer-reviewed articles published by each of the 74 e-journals.  Because the e-journals in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were distributed in different ways, a variety of means had to be employed to do this, ranging from email, listserv, and ftp commands to using Web browsers.  This part of the study was quite illuminating as to the <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>involved in accessing and using e-journals.  Six of the 74 e-journals had published fewer than four articles as of September, 1995, when the data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>took place.  In these cases we studied the articles that were available.</p>

<p>Table 8 summarizes the data relating to the <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>study.  We took the first twenty references in each e-journal article to build our set of references.  If an article had fewer than twenty references, we studied all the references in that article.  For this portion of the study there were a total of 4,317 references from the most recent 279 articles published in 74 scholarly and peer-reviewed e-journals.</p>  
 
<p>Each of the 4317 references was classified as to its format (book, serial, book chapter, online <span>source</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> etc.).  Online sources were further subclassified (web page, email, e-journal article, etc.).  Finally, the accessibility of the references to online sources was tested by <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>trying to retrieve the cited item. 
<p><a href="#table9">Table 9</a> shows the formats and frequencies of the most frequent <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>sources cited by the 279 e-journal articles.  Print serial (43.3%) was the format most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>cited, with books (26.9%) and book chapters and other parts (16.0%) occupying the second and <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>ranks <span>respectively</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  This <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is roughly what is found in <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>studies conducted using print journals in various fields, e.g., library and information science <a href="#harter">(Harter, Nisonger, & Weng, 1993)</a>.</p> 

<p>References were classified as "online sources" in <a href="#table9">Table 9</a> if they were of a variety of electronic subtypes: web pages, electronic personal papers, email messages, e-journal articles, news group postings, listserv postings, and others.  Only 83 online sources (1.9% of the total number of references) were cited by the 74 e-journals (279 articles).  Among the 74 e-journals, only twelve had one or more <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to an online <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and the other 62 e-journals had none at all. 
<p>The <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of online and e-journal references in the twelve e-journals that have at least one <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to an online <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is highly skewed. The e-journal <i>Public-Access <span>Computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Systems Review</i> had 34 online references (40.9%) and <i>Electronic Journal of Virtual Culture</i> and <i>e-journal</i> accounted for a further 25 (30.1%) and 9 (10.8%) <span>respectively</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>from among the total number of 83 online references to online sources.  Thus online references are distributed among only a few e-journals; 68 (81.8%) of the total come from these three. </p>

<p>Table 12 reports accessibility <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in another way, by type of access protocol.  Online information resources are accessible in several ways, and the 83 online references we found are analyzed according to these.  Over half of the cited references included a Uniform Resource Locator (URL).  We tried to access the online resources using a Web browser.  However, only two-thirds of these led to the desired resource (see <a href="#table12">Table 12</a>).  Instead, we obtained the browser message "The server does not have a DNS entry" or the infamous server <span>error</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>message "404 URL Not Found".  Several types of online references, such as Web pages, electronic personal  papers, SGML encoded <span>documents</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>programs, and local file  references, were mainly cited through URLs, often only with a URL.</p>

<p>Only four of the thirteen references including email addresses led to the desired online <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  In <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>cases, we received the message "User Unknown" in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to our email message.  In two other cases, no <span>error</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>message was received, but there was no <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and the online resource could not be obtained. </p>

<p>Nine of the online references were to listserv postings, with six (66.7%) being accessible.  Accessible in this case meant that we could, through the given listserv access information such as name and discussion date, we could retrieve the original sources using listserv commands.  However, three out of nine listserv references were not accessible.  For instance, one listserv <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>cited the 1994 file of <i>CYBERIA-L</i>.  Although we could access the <i>CYBERIA-L</i> archive,  we could not find the original <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>because the archive of <i>CYBERIA-L</i> did not include archives for 1994.</p>

<p>Seven Newsgroup postings were cited, from two different Newsgroups.  We could access the archives of one of them but not the other, obtaining the message, "No such group."  The Newsgroup that we could access maintained postings only from 1996.  Finally,  two newspaper articles that can be accessed through commercial online providers such as Nexis/Lexis were cited, and we were able to access these articles through the same providers.</p>

<p>We labeled five online references as "incomplete access information provided." These were cases in which no information was provided about how to access the <span>source</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> or the information that was provided was insufficient for us to gain access to the resource.</p>

<p>In summary, except for commercially-provided electronic newspapers (to which not all Internet users will have access), none of the access methods led to perfect retrieval. The overall rate of 51.8% must be con0ered to be extremely low, con0ering that the online resources cited were apparently important enough for an author to cite them and yet in just one or two years, nearly half were no longer accessible, given the information provided in the citation.</p>

<p>Recall that the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>study was conducted to fix a kind of upper bound on the current influence of e-journals on scholarly communication.  We argued that authors of e-journal articles would <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>be more inclined than other authors to cite e-journals and other electronic sources.  This still seems like a <span>reasonable</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to us.</p>

<p>We examined 4317 references in 279 scholarly, peer-reviewed articles appearing in 74 e-journals.  Among these, only 83, or 1.9%, were to online sources, and only nine, or 0.2%, were to e-journals.  Only twelve of the 74 e-journals in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>cited one or more online sources.  Only eight of the 74 e-journals cited another e-journal even once, and only one e-journal (not surprisingly, it was the e-journal e-journal) made two or more references to other e-journals.  References to online sources are concentrated in a few e-journals, with <a href="http://info.lib.uh.edu/pr/pacsrev.html"><i>PACS-R</i></a>, <a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/journals/ejvc/"><i>Electronic Journal on Virtual Culture</i></a>, [<strong>Not</strong>e: ceased publication with Volume 4 No. 1, 1996. <em>Ed.</em>] and <a href="http://www.hanover.edu/philos/e-journal/home.html"><i>E-journal</i></a> [<strong>Note:</strong> this journal appears to have ceased publication. I can find no trac of it. <em>Ed.</em>] accounting for more than 80% of all online references.  And among this group, most are concentrated in just a few articles.</p>

<p>It is <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>noting the identity of the e-journals in which the great majority of the references to online sources are made.  The top three have as their <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>subjects of interest topics related to electronic communication.  Among the twelve e-journals citing at least one online <span>reference</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> the five e-journals dealing with online topics (<i>PACS-R</i>, <i>Electronic Journal on Virtual Culture (EJVC)</i>,  <i>e-journal, <a href="http://www.emoderators.com/ipct-j/">Interpersonal <span>Computing</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and Technology</i></a>, <a href="http://www.ascusc.org/jcmc/"><i>Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication</i></a>) account for 71, or 85.5 % of the references to online sources.  This suggests that referencing online sources, and e-journals in particular, is a function mostly of academic <span>discipline</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  One would expect a journal with a name like <i>Electronic Journal on Virtual Culture</i> to cite electronic sources, by <span>virtue</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the subject matter treated in the journal.  Indeed, as subjects of academic treatment, the e-journals listed above <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on new topical areas that have arisen as a result of the new electronic <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> </p> 

<p>On the other hand, the <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>e-journals that have as their subject matter traditional academic specializations (sociology, <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> library and information science, <span>psychology</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>science, and mathematics), cite only twelve online sources between them, and five e-journal articles. 
<p>All of this taken together seems clear evidence that e-journals presently play almost no role in scholarly communication, as <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by references cited. Of course there are other ways of measuring impact; we do not claim that counting references and citations should be relied on exclusively.  Interviews with scholars, for example, might well lead to a different <span>conclusion</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>-- but we <span>doubt</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>it.  Certainly informal communication is being changed in a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>way by the Internet -- especially by listservs, email, and web pages -- even if such communications are not being cited in large numbers.  But the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>study suggests that a significant effect on the formal communication system is yet to happen.  Obviously, this <span>conclusion</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>may well be very different in two or three year's time.</p>

<p><a href="#table11">Tables 11</a> and <a href="#table12">12</a> show that a high percentage (almost 50%) of online resources are not <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>accessible from the information provided in references.  Direct online accessibility to such resources is obviously potentially very convenient to readers, much more so than for print references.  However, if readers cannot gain access to the original sources of the cited material, the references that link the citing and cited works are much less useful than references to print sources.  Note that the references we studied <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in recently published e-journal articles.  One might reasonably expect such references to be largely correct and complete and to lead to the full online information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>  This was not the case.  It is <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>contemplating what percentage of these same references will lead to the original information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in two or three years additional time -- say in the spring of 1998 -- it will very likely be much lower than 50%.   Clearly, the accessibility of cited online resources is potentially a very serious problem in the conduct of research and scholarship, especially if the percentage of references to such sources increases beyond its current very small size.</p>

<h2>Cited work study</h2>

<p>The <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>study reported in the previous section examined the cited references of 74 scholarly, peer-reviewed e-journals.  In the cited work study, it is the references of thousands of print (and a very few electronic) journals that are of interest.  The Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) publishes three citation indexes -- <i>Science Citation Index</i> (SCI), <i>Social Sciences Citation Index</i> (SSCI), and <i>Arts and Humanities Citation Index</i> (AHCI) -- that allow searches of journal <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as cited works.  When a cited work <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on an e-journal such as <i>PACS Review</i> is conducted on SSCI, one retrieves bibliographic citations to all the articles in journals indexed by SSCI that have cited <i>PACS Review</i> in one or more <span>reference</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Since ISI indexes thousands of scholarly journals, which it represents as the most significant journals in the various fields of scholarship, a cited <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>search should retrieve the majority of all citations made in scholarly journals to the cited work.  Such a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>will not reveal citations to a work made in less significant journals or in books and other materials.  In the context of the World Wide Web, a cited work <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>will not reveal the hypertext <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(analogous to citations) to works made in Web pages.  However, these limitations notwithstanding, the ISI indexes are widely recognized as providing a valuable measure of the scholarly impact of articles, journals, and authors -- that is, the formal impact.  Not the only, or even <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the best, measure, but valuable nonetheless. </p>
 
<p>Eugene Garfield, the founder of the <a href="http://www.isinet.com/">Institute for Scientific Information</a>, addressed the issue of the meaning of citation for individuals in a section of his book entitled "What Do Citation Counts Measure": </p>
 
<blockquote>The only responsible claim made for citation counts as an aid in evaluating individuals is that they provide a measure of the <span>utility</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or impact of scientific work.  They say nothing about the nature of the work, nothing about the reason for its <span>utility</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or impact.  Those factors can be dealt with only by content analysis of the cited material and the exercise of knowledgeable peer judgment.  Citation analysis is not meant to replace such judgment, but to make it more objective and astute.  <a href="#garfield">(Garfield, 1979, p. 246)</a>.</blockquote>

<p>Much the same comment applies to the application of citation-based measures to the evaluation of journals.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>number of studies have examined the meaning of citation as an evaluation tool for journals <a href="#mcallister">(McAllister, Anderson, & Narin, 1980)</a> and research <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#narin">Narin, 1976</a>; <a href="#lawani">Lawani, 1986</a> ).  Bibliometric measures have also been used as methods for the evaluation of departments, <span>universities</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and published works.
<p>This portion of the research reports the results of cited work searches of all three ISI citation indexes for the scholarly, peer-reviewed e-journals in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that have had a <span>reasonable</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>chance of being cited.  Since the time lag in the publication schedules of print journals is substantial, we reasoned that a minimum of two years should be necessary to provide time for an e-journal article to be read, become part of an author's research, and <span>eventually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>be cited in a print journal.  For this reason, we <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the cited work searches to those scholarly, peer-reviewed e-journals that began publishing in 1993 or earlier.  There were thirty-nine such e-journals in the <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>The cited work study is in progress. Results from this portion of the research will be presented at the conference.</p>

<h2>Introduction - What's the problem?</h2>

<p>We are increasingly being bombarded by information about something called 'knowledge management', the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of possibly greatest management fascination in the <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>1990's.  Most articles available on this subject (though, thankfully, not all) tacitly promote the notion that knowledge and information are effectively interchangeable.  We are being told that we can 'database' and 'capture' knowledge, that information, in effect, contains meaning.  But does it?  And is this an issue <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>worrying about?  Let's <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>for the moment that it is, and explore why.</p>

<p>In a recent research study into attributes of &quot;knowledge management&quot; by <a href="#dav97">Davies and McDermott</a> (1997), we are told that a number of &quot;lessons were learnt&quot;.  Here are some of them: </p>

<ul><li>&quot;All companies studied have common categories, terms and document attributes so they can <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>find any knowledge element&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Several companies have integrated knowledge capture and sharing into the natural flow of the user's work&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Most companies have a system for organizing and disseminating explicit knowledge&quot;.</li></ul>

<p>Extending this theme (i.e., that knowledge can be captured, made explicit, documented organized, disseminated etc., in effect, managed), recently, Hansen <em>et al.</em> (1999), <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in the <em>Harvard Business Review</em> proclaim:</p>
	
<ul><li>&quot;Invest heavily in IT; the goal is to connect people with reusable codified knowledge&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;The reuse of knowledge saves work, reduces communications costs, and allows a company to take in more projects&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;Because knowledge is a core asset of consultancies, they were among the first businesses to pay <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to - and make heavy investments in - the management of knowledge.  They were also among the first to aggressively explore the use of information technology to capture and disseminate knowledge&quot;.</li></ul>

<p>On the surface such observations sound quite <span>reasonable</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>  But are they? </p>

<h2>Messages and meaning - what's the key distinction? </h2>

<p>Most of us <span>naturally</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>assume that everything we say and do, every piece of information - in effect every message we send and receive, everything we read and write - has meaning.  We've all said at some time: &quot;If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times&quot;, believing that what we &quot;told them&quot; <span>contained</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaning.  Why else would we have bothered?  Why would we make the effort to exchange information with each other - socially, or in <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>- if we thought that the effort might not constitute exchange of meaning?  We generally <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that, when we communicate, others can understand our meaning so long as we make the effort to craft our messages carefully.  We conscientiously attend meetings and are party to an endless stream of emails, faxes, memos and so on, both to - and from - just about everywhere on the planet, yet we are frustrated by the many unexpected and often unsatisfactory outcomes.  People, somehow, always manage to misconstrue our meanings.  We sometimes think: &quot;Wasn't what we communicated clear enough?&quot;  &quot;Can't people understand plain English&quot;?</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p140fig1.gif" width="420" height="140" border="0" alt=""></div>

<p>We spend untold <span>amounts</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of money on management <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and 'training' yet we are sometimes dispirited by the apparently contrary behaviour of people and the <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations so often experience in their efforts to achieve alignment to <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>purpose, <span>industrial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>harmony and sustainable <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>performance</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>  Projects often over-run time and budget and we <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>attribute</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>these outcomes to problems with the quantity and <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of information.  We rarely stop to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>whether our view of information itself is at the root of the problem. </p> 

<p>In the new millennium, we must wonder whether there is some basic underpinning principle, some seriously fundamental concept, which we may not yet have fully grasped despite the advances in the sciences and humanities which have provided such great improvements in <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of life for so many people on earth.  Is it possible that we are on the verge of another breakthrough in our understanding of <span>universal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>laws</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>as the twenty-first century emerges?</p>

<h2>Is it possible that the &quot;Information Age&quot; has <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>undermined human progress?</h2>

<p>It is generally acknowledged that we have been living in the 'information age' since the middle of the twentieth century.  Before this, the world lived through the &quot;industrial age&quot;.  Production, for the most part, was the consequence of manual labour - augmented to an increasing extent by evolving technology - directed and <span>controlled</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>by people responsible for the productivity of machines.</p> 

<p>During the &quot;industrial age&quot;, it was our personal relationships with others that gave our lives meaning.  Most of the experience we gained in those days was tangible and immediate.  Communication was largely face-to-face or paper-based.  Our <span>circle</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of family, friends and acquaintances was generally small, constrained by the primitive state of communications technology and the tyranny of distance.  Interpretation of events could be tested by <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and immediate awareness by our <span>senses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of what was going on around us.  Our <em>knowledge</em> - that is to say what we knew from our <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>experiences - was closely akin to the <em>knowledge</em> of others with whom we <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>lived our lives in close proximity. </p> 

<p>The &quot;information age&quot; changed all that. Through technological innovation and breakthroughs in science, it became possible to deliver information (i.e., messages) accurately - and in an instant - to others, wherever they live on the face of the globe, whether we have any life experience in common with each another or not.  <em><strong>And therein lies the essence of our problem and the <span>cause</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of so many of our quite tragic human and organizational dilemmas. </strong></em>  </p>

<p>We can send information and provoke a <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in almost anyone we wish anywhere on the planet, but we can never be sure - unless we know these people personally - how they are likely to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>(ie what meaning they are likely to make of) the information they receive from us.  And even if we did know others very well indeed, we still could never be certain how their mood at the time might influence the interpretation they make of the information they receive.  But there's an even deeper issue lurking here...</p>

<p><a href="#sve97">Karl-Erik Sveiby</a> (1997) has this to say about information:</p>

<blockquote>...we should turn our concept of information on its head and acknowledge the following radical notion: information is meaningless and of low value.  Currently, however, governments and many businesses alike act as if information is meaningful and has a high value.... Yet the value does not lie in the information stored but in the knowledge created [from it].</blockquote>

<p><em>Information</em>, it turns out, is simply the vehicle by which we attempt to provoke - or evoke - a human <span>response</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>  Information on its own is quite static and lifeless.  It simply exists - on multimedia <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>screens, in text books, magazines, movies, TV, CDs, reports, letters, emails, faxes, memos and so on - all waiting to be interpreted, all waiting to have meaning attached - <em>by people</em>.  As Hugh Mackay explains in his book <em>The Good Listener</em>, although information certainly <em>stands for meaning</em>, it is never <em>meaning</em> itself.  Meaning is a <span>mental</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>thing and is only ever tacit, that is to say, 'in us'.  Identical information almost invariably provokes (or evokes) different meanings in each of us.  This should not surprise us.  Rarely do two people (even <span>identical</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>twins) attach the same meaning to experiences - even when the experiences appear on the surface to be <span>identical</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>- like <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>the same newspaper article, watching the same movie, attending the same political rally or participating in the same meeting.  Identical <em>information</em> always provokes different meanings in us because our interests, motivation, <span>beliefs</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>attitudes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> feelings, sense of relevance etc are always personal and changing - almost minute by minute. </p>

<h2>What then is the basic difference between information and knowledge?</h2>

<p>The following chart (<a href="#sve97">Sveiby, 1997</a>) suggests how information and knowledge are distinguished:</p>

</table>

<p>Knowledge is, after all, <em>what we know</em>.  And <em>what we know</em> cannot be commodified.  Perhaps if we did not have the word &quot;knowledge&quot; and were constrained to say &quot;what I know&quot;, the notion of &quot;knowledge capture&quot; would be seen for what it is - nonsense!</p> 

<p>The more we <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>these issues, the more we are driven to the unpalatable and counter-intuitive <span>conclusion</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that information is <span>intrinsically</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaningless on its own and remains so unless - and until - it is interpreted by human beings, within some context. &quot;<em>I = 0</em>&quot; is perhaps an elegant way of expressing this <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>truth.</p>

<h2>If <em>I = 0</em>, then what role does information play? </h2>

<p>Why do we attach so much importance to information?  Because without information we would not have 'triggers' to alert us to the need to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>events (assuming we think the events are relevant enough to bother interpreting).  Information provides us with an opportunity to make meaning of sensory input.  Without information, there is nothing to provoke us to 'sit up and take notice'.  This is its <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>value.  Of course, information provokes different people in different ways, and this is also a critical issue.  The simple fact is that without information, our <span>senses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>are devoid of stimulation.  And without information, we can have no way of being certain we even exist.  (Experiments with total sensory deprivation produce symptoms of madness.)  The life-long learning process itself could be said to be the on-going re-construction of meaning stimulated by a perpetual series of <em>I = 0</em> events.</p>

<p>For this reason, information is critically important in the lives of people.  <em>But if we then take the step of ascribing <span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaning to the information itself, we cross the boundary of rationality and enter a bizarre world where we <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that impersonal stimuli have <span>minds</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of their own and can have their own meaning!</em></p>

<p>(The only time information could be said to 'imply meaning' is when the meaning provoked - or evoked - is predictable, as might be the case in the transmission of scientific information.  But, as we know, even mathematical proofs are subject to interpretation.)</p>  

<p>When then does <em>information</em> become <em>knowledge</em>?  The answer: <strong>at the moment of its human interpretation</strong> (and not an instant before!) </p> 

<p>Writing from the <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of Ericksonian psychotherapy, <a href="#bro91">Brown</a> (1991) notes that:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Unless <span>abstract</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>symbols</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>are mediated through personal experience they have no meaning&quot;.</blockquote>

<p><a href="#mye98">Myers and Myers</a> (1998) state:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;... words don't have meanings.  There is no <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>relationship between the thing you are talking about and the words you use.  Only as these words are related through the thoughts of a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>do they have meaning.  Meaning is not in the object or in the <span>symbol</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>but in the <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of these through the human [communication process]&quot;.</blockquote>

<p><a href="#mac98">Hugh Mackay</a> (1998) suggests that:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;It's not what our message does to the listener - but what the listener does with our message [that determines our success in communication]&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;It's not the meaning we put into the message but the meaning the audience puts into the message that matters&quot;.</blockquote>

<p><a href="#dev97">Keith Devlin</a> (1997), senior researcher at Stanford University's Centre for the <span>Study</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>Language</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and Communication <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to</p>

<blockquote>&quot;… the work of Alfred Tarski, a Polish-American logician who, in the early 1920s, in attempting to develop a mathematical theory of meaning made a <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>observation about any language, formal or natural, <span>namely</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that 'Language does not, in of itself, have meaning.  Meaning is not <span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to language.  The meaning of a word or a <span>sentence</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>arises from whatever it is that the word or <span>sentence</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>refers to.'&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Why then do we persist in the <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that messages contain <span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaning  when the literature abounds with evidence to the effect that information <span>possesses</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>no <span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaning, and that in fact <em>I</em> always =<em> 0</em>?  </p>

<h2>Can we ever manage knowledge?  </h2>

<p>To answer this question, we have to ask ourselves whether we can ever manage 'what people know'.</p>

<p><a href="#all97">Verna Allee</a> (1997) puts it this way:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;There is no way I could possibly catalog even my own personal knowledge.  What makes us think we can somehow catalog or <span>map</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>all the knowledge that re0es in a complex enterprise of hundreds or thousands of people?  What on earth do we think we can accomplish by 'managing' knowledge?&quot;</blockquote>

<p><a href="#non95">Nonaka and Takeuchi</a> (1995) also make the point:</p>

<blockquote>&quot; ... information is a flow of messages, while knowledge is created by that very flow of information anchored in the <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and commitment of its holder.  This ... emphasises that knowledge is <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>related to human action&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Thus the notion that we can 'capture' knowledge becomes ludicrous, just as ludicrous as the notion that we can 'capture people's thoughts'.  In fact, it is a useful <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>when attempting to understand the notion of 'knowledge' to exchange it for a moment with the word 'people', and <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>whether the <span>sentence</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>still makes sense.  If it doesn't, a more appropriate word would <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>have been 'information'!</p>

<p>Michael Polanyi, a pre-eminent thinker and author in this field (see, for example, <a href="#pol66">The Tacit Dimension</a>, 1966), has been widely misinterpreted (in this author's opinion) by more recent writers who have suggested that Polanyi viewed knowledge as - in one sense tacit - and in another sense explicit.  This was not his view.  For Polanyi, knowledge was only ever tacit.  Once we attempt to make knowledge (i.e., what we 'know') explicit, it reverts immediately to an 'information' state again and <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>human intervention anew for sense to be made of it.  This is slippery <span>business</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>  Is it conceivable that the tacit/explicit confusion can be <span>traced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to the very existence of the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>'knowledge'?</p>

<h2>What's <span>wrong</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>with the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot;knowledge&quot;?</h2>

<p>Language (unfortunately) makes it possible to treat as 'objective' (i.e., explicit) what is only ever 'subjective' (i.e., tacit).  For example</p>
 
<ul>
<li>&quot;how I feel&quot; (tacit) can become &quot;feeling&quot; (explicit) </li>
<li>&quot;being safe&quot; (tacit) can become &quot;safety&quot; (explicit) </li>
<li>&quot;what I learn&quot; (tacit) can become &quot;education&quot; or &quot;training&quot; (explicit) </li>
<li>&quot;how I relate to you&quot; (tacit) can become a &quot;relationship&quot; (explicit) </li>
<li>&quot;what I know&quot; (tacit) can become &quot;knowledge&quot; (explicit)</li>
</ul>

<p>and so on.  </p>

<p>This point is <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>by the recent work of  <a href="#pfe00">Pfeffer and Sutton</a> (2000) who point out that</p>

<blockquote>&quot;The … problem with much of the existing literature and practice of knowledge management is that it conceptualises knowledge as something tangible and explicit that is quite <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>from philosophy or <span>values</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>… The noun 'knowledge' implies that knowledge is a 'thing'… <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>is embedded in… shared <span>spaces</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>where it is then <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>through <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>own experience or reflections on the experiences of others… <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>is intangible.&quot;</blockquote>

<p>Language - and in particular its 'noun' form - enables us to distance ourselves from our thoughts, feelings and experience and to 'objectify' them.  This is a serious issue because, by ostensibly transforming the personal into the impersonal, we tacitly accept the legitimacy of capture, packaging and <span>storage</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> implying that our thoughts, feelings and experience can be re-established - just as they once were - at another time.  The act of 'objectifying' stops time dead in its tracks and transforms live experience into patterns of data and <span>symbols</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>- i.e., into 'information'.  And while 'information' can, of course, be captured, stored, accessed and processed, <em>the human experience underpinning it - and making sense of it - cannot.</em></p>

<h3>Some implications of <em>I = 0</em> for dictionaries</h3>

<p>We <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that words have <span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaning and that dictionaries are the repositories of those meanings.  &quot;If you want to know the meaning of a word, look it up in the dictionary&quot; we are told.  Yet, dictionaries are not repositories of meaning at all, but simply history books of word usage (Hayakawa).  <span>Language</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>is simply the explicit vehicle by which we transform meanings (in us) into <span>symbols</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>(eg words) which then provoke (or evoke) meanings in others.  Although the words we use <em>stand for meaning</em>, we should not <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that those words <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>provoke the same meaning in others.  In fact, more often than not, they provoke quite different meanings.  The <span>rule</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>is: words don't <span>possess</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaning, they simply serve to initiate the making of meaning.  Stated another way, <em>I = 0</em>.  For this reason, we must be wary of dictionaries.  They can never - and were never <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to - resolve an argument about meanings.</p>

<h3>Some implications of <em>I = 0</em> for communications</h3>

<p>Most would <span>agree</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that almost nothing is more important than effective and efficient communications.  Yet how many of us think that we communicate well?  Is it possible that something very basic is lacking in our understanding of communication despite the books we read, the courses we attend, or the consultants we've engaged?  Maybe we simply don't communicate enough?  Or is it that we communicate too much.  Or is it something entirely different….?</p>

<p>We need to remind ourselves that the word 'communicate' is a <em>verb</em>, and as with all verbs, can be performed unilaterally, as in: 'I communicate', 'you communicate', 'he/she communicates' etc.  But, we must ask ourselves, is 'communicating' something that can be done by individuals in isolation?  Interestingly, the verb 'communicate' provokes/evokes different meanings in people.  Some examples of 'communications' language are:</p>

<blockquote>transmit, pass on, report, get through, tell, convey, deliver, contact, inform, broadcast, <span>speak</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> announce, relate, send, share, commune, exchange, swap, connect, understand, dialogue, listen, converse, explore etc. </blockquote>

<p>Where is the meaning here?  Certainly not in the words themselves!  The tragedy of the entire notion of communications is that so many of us believe that by delivering messages (ie information) we are thereby delivering meaning.  The reality is, however, that information contains no <span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaning i.e., <em>I = 0</em>.  Successful communications <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>on knowing others well enough or caring about others deeply enough (the tacit dimension) to imagine how they are likely to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>the (explicit) messages we exchange with them.   Small wonder <em>e-mails</em> - and the many other forms of explicit information - have the potential to create such havoc in human relationships.</p>

<h3>Some implications of <em>I = 0</em> for training and learning</h3>

<p>How many people stop to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>what the difference is between <em>training</em> and <em>learning</em>?  Most of us <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>take for granted that they are two 0es of the same coin, though the one (training) is explicit (i.e., information delivery) and the other (learning) is tacit (i.e., the making of personal meaning).</p>  

<p>Experiments recently conducted (by Hatch Associates) <span>attempted</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to understand the meanings people attach to certain key words in the workplace.  When the word <em>training</em> was thrown into the ring, surprisingly, it typically evoked negative reactions.  Words like <em>teaching, classrooms, schedules, assessment, authority, competency measurement, control, accreditation, dependency, <span>tests</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>discipline</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> boredom, manipulation</em> etc., covered the white board.</p>

<p><em>Learning</em>, on the other hand, generated a quite different and more positive <span>list</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> evoking such responses as: <em>self-direction, understanding, enthusiasm, self-pacing, independence, open discussion, success, commitment, freedom, ease of access, excitement, maturity, honesty,</em> etc.  Despite these very different <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and responses, why do we still continue to use the language of <em>training</em> and <em>learning</em> virtually synonymously?  Is it because we do not appreciate that <em>I = 0</em> and that people will invariably <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>language in their idiosyncratically personal contexts? </p>

<h3>Some implications of <em>I = 0</em> for safety</h3>

<p>Safety is clearly the <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of everyone.  Yet how many of us <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>the notion of safety in the same way?  When a few people were asked what it evoked for them, there were many responses:</p>

<blockquote>LTI's, policy, procedures, reports, threat, blame, protection, vigilance, precaution, shelter, training, passports, statistics, policing, covering up, hazards, life, caring, sharing, shielding, uncertainty, <span>consequences</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> threat … and so on. </blockquote>  

<p>This provides clear evidence, once again, that it is not what the message does to the audience but what the audience does with the message that really matters.  From the <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>above, it would be difficult to find a single thought about safety that everyone shares.  Is it conceivable that the noun 'safety' (the commodity) might not, in fact, be the best language to inspire people to behave safely?  In light of <em>I = 0</em> might not the language of 'safely' or 'be safe' evoke more powerful human (i.e., tacit) responses and hence serve to encourage more responsible and safer workplace behaviour?</p>

<h3>Some implications of <em>I = 0</em> for <em>quality</em> initiatives</h3>

<p>For years now, many organizations have taken 'quality' to mean compliance with documented processes <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to achieve 'fitness for purpose'.  (One might well ask: who decides what's fit or whether a purpose is appropriate or not; indeed even whether the <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>deciding is 'fit for purpose'!)  The very act of documentation transforms ideas - which can originate only in the <span>minds</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of people (tacitly) - into databases of information, which if inappropriately interpreted, can result in unwanted outcomes indeed.  Sadly, we seem not to have appreciated that attempts to 'capture' (i.e., make explicit) human intentions serves only to transform them into <span>intrinsically</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaningless <span>symbols</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>even if made efficiently accessible from procedure manuals, <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>databases, intranets and other sophisticated information sources.  Captured information always relies on responsible people (i.e., of quality) interpreting it within a context - and sharing and comparing <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>where alignment to <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>purpose is a desired outcome.  Information cannot <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>itself!  <em>I = 0</em></p>

<h3>Some implications of <em>I = 0</em> for bidding on jobs</h3>

<p>We traditionally <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>- when we receive requests to bid on jobs - that bid documentation provided has <span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaning and reflects accurately the intentions of the customer.  In effect, we <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that the 'message contains the meaning' and that we can decode intentions accurately, if we work hard enough at it!  But <em>I = 0</em>, and as a result, we can but make our own meaning of information received.  We then attempt to construct a reply which - while <em>standing</em> for our meaning - cannot itself 'contain' our meaning.  The bid <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>must somehow then invoke an appropriate meaning in the mind of the customer, which invariably <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in yet another context.  Thus the 'meaning' <span>chain</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>linking the thoughts of documentation authors, the <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of bidders and the final recipients of bids is broken many times in the process. </p> 

<p>Can anything be done to retrieve the situation?  Yes, but only if a relationship is <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>between the parties involved <em>which is sufficiently trusting</em> to enable them to share and compare the various <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of their messages when sending and receiving information.  If the bidding process does not allow such sharing and <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to take place, the prospect for desired outcomes is severely hampered.  The reason should be clear: <em>I = 0</em>.   (See <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>2)</p>

<h2>Where does this leave the notion of <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>Management (KM)?</h2>

<p>This is a vexed issue.  KM is, sadly, deeply embedded in most <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>literature connected with the productivity of intangible assets.  Yet this paper tries to make clear that when subjected to critical analysis, KM is an untenable notion.  <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>(i.e., what people know) simply cannot be captured or managed, and hence the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>Knowledge Management is inappropriate.  Worse still, the language of KM suggests that knowledge is a commodity capable also of being processed, delivered, transmitted etc when it is not.  Whilst knowledge sharing is an acceptable concept, the notion of knowledge management is, at best, dubious!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2> 

<p>As explained in this paper, information - though it serves a fundamental and vital role as a provoker and evoker of meaning in people - <span>possesses</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>no <span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaning of its own.  This has enormous <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>implications for people, safety, communications, knowledge sharing, relationships, training and learning, <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>processes, customer service and so on.   The statement &quot;I = 0&quot; is <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to remind us of an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>truth ... and to help us resist the pressure of information technology (and of its well-meaning protagonists) to undermine the value and <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of 'knowledge' as a human concept.  <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>(ie 'what we know') is only ever 'tacit' and can never be 'explicit'.  It must never be thought of as a commodity to be captured, processed, stored, transmitted, managed etc.  Only human beings can intelligently make sense of - and provide an appropriate context for - information.  Only human beings have the capacity to construct meaning from information and to sense 'meaning' evolving in themselves and in others.  Only human beings can compare <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>with a view to achieving a shared purpose.  Information, no matter how elegantly processed and presented, is incapable - on its own - of achieving anything!  <em>The irony of all this, of course, is that this paper likewise contains no <span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaning.  Whatever meanings are ascribed to it are simply the <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and judgements made of it by its readers. </em> </p> 

<p>The author would, nevertheless, wish readers to infer from this paper that the importance increasingly being placed on  <em>accessibility to</em> information is seriously out of <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>with the importance that needs to be placed on  <em>interpretation and sharing of</em> information, and that this imbalance needs urgent <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to redress.</p>

<p>Lastly, the language of 'knowledge management' serves only to confuse.  It seriously diminishes the prospect that intangible assets (people) will be recognised within <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and industry as being the <em>sine qua non</em> of all value, <span>growth</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> innovation, development and prosperity.  KM serves people up on the altar of technology.  If we lose sight - even for a moment - of the message that <em>I = 0</em>, humanity could well be subsumed entirely within technology in the years ahead to its unfathomable cost.</p>

<h1>Afterword</h1>

<p>This paper has created somewhat of a stir among 'Knowledge Management' aficionados since it was originally presented to the KNOW'99 <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>Conference at the University of Technology, Sydney Australia in Nov 1999.  Some salient reactions were:</p>

<ul>
<li>If information has no meaning, how can we ever get our message across?</li>
<li>Of course knowledge can be stored, managed and accessed. Libraries have been doing it for <span>centuries</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> </li>
<li>If we can't capture peoples' knowledge, how can we hope to retain corporate memory in these downsizing times? </li>
<li>KM is a time-honoured initiative in <span>business</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>  Many large organizations swear by it and are spending fortunes on it. Are you suggesting that KM is not an intellectually robust activity despite the vast resources being applied to it? </li>
<li>Information may <span>possess</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>very little meaning but certainly not <span>zero</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaning!
…. and so forth</li>
</ul>

<p>Of the many comments received, only a very small percentage went to the nub of the argument being presented, i.e., that information has no <span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaning <em>(I = 0) </em> and that shared human interpretation is always necessary. Assumptions were constantly being made about language and its <span>supposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>disembodied meaning without an attempt to explore implied or inferred meanings i.e., the human <span>response</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>  In effect, the critical question &quot;What do you mean by…..?&quot; was rarely being asked, or answers explored.  Most observers were comfortable assuming that 'what was said was meant, and, in effect, that 'knowledge management' was <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>what it implied, i.e., 'knowledge management'! </p> 

<h3>What might we do to fix the problem? </h3>

<p>It should be becoming obvious that language, and the meanings we attach to it, lie at the core of many human dilemmas and certainly is at the root of the KM predicament.  KM simply has no <span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaning (I = 0).  Experience has demonstrated that because we have sanctioned use of the single word 'knowledge' to evoke such radically different <span>interpretations</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> sensible and balanced discussion has become virtually <span>impossible</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>  What is needed now is a pragmatic approach to eliminating <span>semantic</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>confusion in a simple straightforward manner. </p>

<p>The answer, I would <span>suggest</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> lies in differentiating between 'messages' and 'meaning'.   The <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>'message' <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to evoke images of things inanimate, explicit and capturable etc whereas 'meaning' <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to evoke notions of things human, personal, tacit, uncapturable etc.  By linking (and restricting) the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>'knowledge' to 'meaning'-related language and 'information' to 'message'-related language, the KM predicament is capable of being resolved.</p>

<p>As far as the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>'management' is concerned, the 'message/meaning' dichotomy assists us here as well.  Whilst we can <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>manage 'messages', we cannot manage 'meaning'.   We can however 'share meaning', though the process is still  poorly <span>understood</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>  (There's a world of difference between communicating to and communicating with!)</p>

<p>For the above reasons, it is suggested that the KM predicament is best resolved by jettisoning the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>KM once and for all in favour of unambiguous <span>differentiated</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>language viz Information Management (IM) and <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>Sharing (KS) (for example).  The <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>'knowledge' must never again be permitted to serve two masters!</p>
 
<p>It's time to stop genuflecting to the KM 'Emperor' once and for all.  As Edmund Burke (1729-1797) suggested long ago:  'there's a point past which forbearance ceases to be a <span>virtue</span>' <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> (Burke, 1762).  In relation to KM, we are now well past that point.</p>

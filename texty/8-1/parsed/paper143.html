<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Knowledge and innovation played an important role in the development of
society. The transformation from an agrarian society to the information
society has largely been brought about as a result of accumulation of knowledge
through the <span>centuries</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>by its very nature <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>on other knowledge
to build on. <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>creation is, in fact, a process of value addition
to previous knowledge through innovation (<a href="#duf99">Duffy, 1999</a>;
<a href="#nar01">Narayanan,
2001</a>). This also implies that the more knowledge we already possess
the more we will be in a position to create and transfer to others. The
key to economic success is always linked to the advances in knowledge creation
and the ability of a nation in translating knowledge into products and
services. But while knowledge existed since the existence of mankind, it
is only recently that it has been recognized as a factor of production.
Many people have recognized that knowledge is the only meaningful economic
resource in the knowledge society (<a href="#for96">Foray &amp; Lundvall,
1996</a>; <a href="#joh98">Johnston &amp; Rolf, 1998</a>). It has been
now recognised as the driver of productivity and economic <span>growth</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> leading
to a new <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>on the role of information, technology and learning in economic
<span>performance</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>'knowledge-based economy' stems from this recognition
of the place of knowledge and technology in <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>economies.</p>

<p>Knowledge creates knowledge and in the process brings competitive advantage
and leads to wealth creation. <a href="#pru99">Prusak</a> (1999) pointed
out that due to the <span>abstract</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>nature of knowledge, traditional economics
and general scholastic research in the past did not really <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>on it.
He <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>that knowledge was treated as a black box which enabled the
transformation of inputs to outputs. Davenport and Prusak stated:</p>

<blockquote>Knowledge is a fluid mix of framed experience, <span>values</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> contextual
information, and expert insight that provides a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>for evaluating
and incorporating new experiences and information. It originates and is
applied in the <span>minds</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of knower. In organizations, it often becomes embedded
not only in <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>or repositories but also in organizational routines,
processes, <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> and norms. (<a href="#dav98">Davenport &amp; Prusak, 1998: 5)</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowledge embodied in books and journals does not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>translate
into useful and usable knowledge unless it is read, manipulated and communicated
from one <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to another. In other words, knowledge can only re0e in
the <span>minds</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of people and the minute it leaves the human mind, it is information.
However, not all types of knowledge can be codified and captured. Knowledge
in the form of skills and competencies can only be transferred from one
<span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to another through <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> Information management on the other
hand deals with knowledge that can be captured, processed and managed.
Sveiby in 1996 proposed the IT track and the People Track approach to knowledge
management. The IT
track focuses on the management of information. The knowledge management
activities comprise the construction of information management <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
artificial intelligence, data mining and other enabling technologies. In
this case knowledge can be treated as objects that can be identified and
handled in an information system. The People track focuses on the management
of people. The core knowledge management activities encompass assessing,
changing and improving human individual skills and/or behaviour. It is
a complex set of dynamic skills and know-how that is constantly changing.
This simple approach to defining knowledge management, as an IT Track and
People Track does not take into account knowledge embodied in processes
and workflows or generated as a result of people interacting with information
<span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>around them. An expert in one organization
might not perform with the same capacity when moved to another organization.
According to <a href="#bro98">Brown and Druguid</a> (1998), knowledge is
not a property of individual but rather <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>collectively by people working
together. 'Know how' is a knowledge created out of practice and collectively
shared by workgroup.</p>

<h2>Understanding tacit knowledge</h2>

<p>Everyone is more or less agreed that explicit knowledge is information.
Information management and <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>is a very well <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>area and
many of us <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>with the techniques and methods used for processing
and managing information. The confusion surrounding knowledge management
seems to be contributed largely to the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of understanding of tacit knowledge.
Tacit knowledge is a type of knowledge that many people believe that can
only exist in the human <span>minds</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> It is a product of people <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>with
each other and the people <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>with the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>around them.
<a href="#pol58">Polyni</a> (1958, 1966) <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to tacit knowledge as something that we do unconsciously and most of the time we are not aware of its existence. <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in the
form of skills and competencies is normally <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>through training and
<span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>with the <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> It is not only difficult to articulate,
but according to Polyni, it is something that we cannot <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and even
we do not know. He explains, 'we can know more than we can tell'.</p>

<p>From my experience working as a consultant to the trademark project
in the Ministry of <span>Law</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in Singapore, I realized that it is not possible
to describe some of the picture marks by using text. They are made up of
geometrical shapes using <span>symbols</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and pictures. The investigators in the
trademark department rely on their experience in dealing with picture marks
and they have to make their own judgement on what constitute a conflicting
or similar trademark. Such knowledge that they gain from experience is
very hard to document, given the fact that the picture marks themselves
cannot be described using text. Even if image-processing techniques are
employed, still the knowledge needed to judge a conflicting trademark will
continue to re0e in the investigator's mind. Computers and the use of
pattern matching techniques can only help to classify picture marks according
to their similarity in descending or ascending order but will not be able
to judge whether a trademark can be <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>or rejected.</p>

<p>Having said that, not all types of knowledge are hidden and cannot be
expressed. 'Know how' or implicit knowledge is a type of knowledge that
can be expressed and articulated. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>good example is Xerox Eureka project
(<a href="#bob99">Bobrow, 1999</a>). The Eureka system gathers shared tips
on service repair for technician worldwide. The information captured in
the system can benefit other technicians who might face the same or similar
problem. "Know how", in my opinion, is what <a href="#non95">Nonaka and
Takeuchi</a> (1995) <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to when they talked about tacit knowledge
to explicit knowledge conversion. According to them knowledge conversion
is about the <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>between explicit and tacit knowledge in continuous
and spiral manner. Unlike skills and competencies, the "Know how" can be
documented and the knowledge can be transferred through an independent
learning process. The process and ingredients of making cake can be documented,
the reader might not be able to master it from the first time, but through
<span>trials</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>he might be able to do it even better than the originator.</p>

<p>This highlights the fact that not all types of knowledge can be captured
and codified as information. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>great <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of useful knowledge is normally
<span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>when people leave their organizations or they feel that there is no
incentive for them to share what is rightly theirs. In fact, in the Eureka
project (according to Dan Holtshouse, director of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy knowledge initiatives for Xerox, quoted in &quot;<a href="#kno99">Knowledge...</a> (1999)) the biggest problem was motivating the service technicians: 'It took us a while to <span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>out the right incentive
to get [the service technicians] to submit their tips.'</p> 

<p>When talking about knowledge management, it is clear that we are dealing
with a set of complex issues that are interrelated and cannot be segmented.
This is because much of the knowledge creation activities are products
of people interacting with people, people interacting with data and information,
people interacting with <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and people interacting with the environment
in which they operate. Understanding tacit knowledge is <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to the
development of an effective approach to knowledge management. The three
different types of knowledge that knowledge management is concerned with
are:</p> 

<blockquote>1.&nbsp; Explicit knowledge (information).
<br>2.&nbsp; "Know how" or implicit knowledge (Can be captured and codified
as information)
<br>3.&nbsp; Tacit knowledge (Cannot be captured and codified as information).</blockquote>

<p>For knowledge management to succeed, we need to treat knowledge as an activity
and not an as an object. The minute an activity is transformed to an object,
it should not be called knowledge but rather a piece of information. Therefore,
information management <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>are good in managing objects and not activities.</p>

<h2>The importance of technology in knowledge management</h2>

<p>Technology plays an important role in knowledge management, although knowledge
management is not about technology. Technology facilitates the process
of transmitting and exchanging information. It can be used to manage uncertainty
and complexity, where information is more factual and a high <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of
<span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>is not required.</p>

<p>Technology enables individuals to coordinate the logistics of face-to-face
meetings. It can also be used to catalogue expertise of organizational
members and as a result facilitating access to the right people and enhancing
knowledge sharing. Computer-mediated communication such as electronic mail
or computer-conferences can help to <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>continuity and connection
between conversations, especially for those in different locations (<a href="#mar01">Marwik,
2001</a>). One of the key technologies that is driving knowledge management
is collaborative technology. Collaboration <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>enable a company's professionals
to work together and work virtually regardless of the geographical location.
Web technology allows organizations to build Web and knowledge portals
that can handle substantial amount of information and made it accessible
to users anywhere anytime.</p>

<p>Knowledge management <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>are technologies, broadly defined, which
enhance and enable knowledge generation, codification (know how), and transfer
(<a href="#rug97b">Ruggles, 1997b</a>). Typically, they are <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to
ease the burden of work and to allow resources to be applied efficiently
to the tasks for which they are most suited. It is important to note that
information management <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>are a subset of knowledge management <span>tools</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
Information management <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>allow organizations to generate, access, store,
and analyse data, usually in the form of facts and <span>figures</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> Information
management <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>enable the manipulation of information but do not capture
the complexity of context and the richness of knowledge. While knowledge
management <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>may include <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>that also handle data and information,
data and information management <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>are not robust enough to truly facilitate
knowledge management. According to <a href="#rug97b">Ruggles</a> (1997b),
an analogy is the difference between <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of the Mona
Lisa and the deeper <span>connections</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> which comes from seeing the painting itself.
<span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>tools can help us create, see, and share the paintings.</p>

<p><a href="#duf01">Duffy</a> (2001) also made a distinction between technologies
for knowledge management and technologies for information management. According
to Duffy, information management primarily focuses on <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>work-related
objects and <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>them around, while knowledge management <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>itself
with <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>work objects as well as with how they are created
and used. One other key distinction is that the means of creating, capturing,
and communicating in knowledge management <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>are very broad while
the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in information management <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span><span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to be on electronic and
paper-based information. To support both explicit and tacit knowledge,
a knowledge management system needs to be built with content and collaboration
technologies. Data technologies are structured and typically numerically
oriented; knowledge technologies <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>most often with text. <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>technologies
are more likely to need human <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>than data technologies because
transactions are fewer and <span>volumes</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>lower, with <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and iteration
commonplace.</p>

<p>According to <a href="#dav98">Davenport and Prusak</a> (1998), knowledge
technologies <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>with text rather than numbers, and text
in relatively unstructured forms, such as clauses, <span>sentences</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> and paragraphs,
and even stories. <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>technologies, however, are more likely to be
employed in an interactive and iterative manner by their users. Therefore,
the <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of people in knowledge technologies are integral to their success.
<p>According to <a href="#del97">De Long, <i>et al.</i></a> (1997), in
reality, most knowledge management projects undertaken by organizations
are a mix of knowledge and information management. <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>management
projects have several <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>that differentiate them from traditional
information management projects. These unique <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge
management projects are; the goals of knowledge management projects emphasize
on value-added for users and not simply delivery and accessibility of information,
knowledge management projects support organization improvement and innovation
and not just existing operations, it adds value to content by filtering,
synthesizing, interpreting, and pruning content and it usually requires
on-going user <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and feedback and not just one-way transfer
of information.</p>

<p>Information management <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>are a very important component of any
knowledge management project. But while these <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>are very useful, unfortunately,
they are not <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to capture the complexity of context and the richness
of knowledge. Clearly, there is a need to rethink the approach in designing
and developing information <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> There is a need to go beyond merely
the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and replace approach of changing the word document in "document
management" to the word knowledge in "knowledge management". Unless knowledge
management leads to fundamental changes in the <span>design</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> development and
deployment of information <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> it will remain an illusion best described
as that of the 'Emperor's new clothes'.</p>

<h2>The key drivers of knowledge management</h2>

<p>For knowledge organizations where the <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of the company is heavily dependent
on tacit knowledge, managing tacit knowledge and protecting intellectual
property is important. Some of the key drivers for knowledge management
in any organization include:</p>

<h3>Achieving organizational efficiency</h3>

<p>Knowledge management plays a significant role in achieving organizational
efficiency. In the new economy, speed and responsiveness are determining
success factors, especially in the dot.com arena. Companies today face
stiffer competition in a globalized market place. <a href="#dav98">Davenport
and Prusak</a> (1998), highlighted that the globalized economy, with improved
communication and transportation, provides consumers with unprecedented
and endless parade of choices for goods and services worldwide.</p>

<p><a href="#hua98">Huang</a> (1998), <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>that responsiveness is a
key to survival, including delivery of services, speed of implementation
of global <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and efficient processes. He <span>added</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> 'Continuous improvement
in operational efficiency and productivity is <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to long <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>earning
<span>growth</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>. Indeed, in the Internet world where customer expect services to
be available on a twenty-four hour basis, firms have no <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>but to make
the quantum leap improvement in various aspects of their services such
as time-to-market, time-to-solution and time-to-delivery, or risk being
forced out of <span>business</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> This in turn created the need for organizations
to have organized information to facilitate their operations, information
that is timely, <span>accurate</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> useful and more importantly tailored to organizations
need. There is also increased pressure on firms to recycle and re-use knowledge,
<span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of reinventing the wheel.</p>

<h3>Staying ahead of competition</h3>
 
In order to stay ahead of the competition, firms nowadays understand fully
the need to know (a) their customers and (b) their competitors deeply.
<a href="#ste96">Stewart</a> (1997), recognized that customers are an integral part of the firms intellectual capital (i.e., customer capital) and the firms reason for existence. Many
firms certainly understand the need to manage and service the customers
needs and the need for a structured approach to managing customer relationship.
In recent years, IT <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>such as customer relationship management
(CRM) packages have <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>highly popular when it comes to explicit knowledge
(information) managment.</p>

<p>The other <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>factor in staying ahead of the competition is the
need to know the competition. <a href="#wee91">Wee &amp; Bambang</a> (1991),
highlighted that intelligence gathering and market intelligence are crucial
activities that companies must undertake in todays competitive business
world. They attributed the success of Japanese companies to their extensive
market intelligence <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>that they had put in place. Thus, knowledge
management plays a critical role in managing customer relationship and
competitive intelligence, by collecting jigsaw pieces of information and
piecing together the puzzle on the customers, competitors and the overall
market.</p>

<h3>Maximizing organizational potential</h3>

<p>Knowledge management also <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>companies to link the knowledge management
initiatives back to their <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>objectives and goals. For knowledge
organizations, the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>driver is maximizing the value of its R&amp;D investments
through 'recycling and re-using' experiments. <a href="#cor99">Cortada,
<i>et al.</i></a> (1999), noted that these companies (e.g., 3M and BP) clearly
understand the potential of knowledge management. For example, 3M prides
itself for able to 'learn from mistakes' and also turn them into profitable
products. Its 'Post-It Notes' product is an epitome of achieving success
through errors. It has provided opportunitiesfor cross-fertilization leading
to successful spin-offs.</p>

<p>Knowledge management is also credited for its role in preserving corporate
memory and thus ensuring organizational effectiveness. Companies have found
knowledge management useful in combating the effects of staff turnover,
as it helps to retain critical knowledge through dedicated capturing of
knowledge or facilitating transfer between staff. <a href="#dav98">Davenport
and Prusak</a> (1998), noted that downsizing can create 'knowledge scarcity'
with layoffs of personnel with the needed corporate knowledge, which can
lead to <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>processes or even 'luring back the laid off workers' or
alternative knowledge sources are higher rates.</p>

<h3>Managing intellectual capital</h3>

<p><a href="#ste97">Stewart</a> (1997) wrote:</p>

<blockquote>'Knowledge has become the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>ingredient of what we make,
do, buy and sell. As a result, managing it - <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>intellectual
capital, storing it, selling it, sharing it - has become the most important
economic task of individuals, <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and nations.'</blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="#dru88">Drucker</a> (1988), <span>predicted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>that
the organization of the <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>would be knowledge-based and would comprise
largely of&nbsp; specialists who <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>discipline</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>their own performance
through organized feedback from colleagues, customers and headquarters.
He <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>that a large and successful information-based organization would
be one without any middle management, citing the British civil administration
in India before the World War II as an example. The British had successfully
managed the Indian subcontinent using a very flat structure.</p>

<p>Stewart explained that the <span>rise</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of the knowledge worker is the result
of an elevation of work from 'hands to mind', from sweatshop jobs to knowledge-work
jobs. He <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>that in the New Economy, there is a fundamental change in
the approach to <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>measurement: professionals are <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>by
their ability to deliver results rather than the competency in performing
the tasks. This <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>by <a href="#dru88">Drucker</a> (1988), who asserted
that that <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>needed to turn themselves into 'organizations of knowledge
specialists'.</p>

<p>Knowledge specialists work together as a team to achieve a common goal.
These specialists need not be told how to do their jobs and they should
also take on 'information responsibility'. For example, in a hospital,
the healthcare professionals (e.g., doctors, paramedics and the nutritionists)
work closely to nurse the sick and injured back to good health, through
an elaborate system of reports and an information centre (at the nurse
station). Stewart viewed human capital as the most important asset of companies
nowadays and not the traditional view of raw materials and machinery. He
noted that the way huge corporations scrambled to find ways to retain their
best staff (e.g., generous stock options, huge bonus) is an indication.
However, he argued that human capital on its own cannot make the impact,
it needs Structural Capital, to 'manage the knowledge'. Structural Capitals
role in Intellectual Capital is 'continuous recycling and creation utilization
of shared knowledge and experiences'. Its purpose is two-fold: (a) codify
and preserve knowledge that can be transferred, specifically through documentation
or <span>storage</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in databases; and (b) facilitate the linking of people to their
sources for data, experts and expertise - on a just-in-time basis.</p>

<h2>Jumping on the bandwagon</h2>

<p>With knowledge management as a concept is looking so attractive, many organisations
are jumping on the bandwagon. It is also important to note that for many
organisations, knowledge management is something trendy and has a positive
impact on the organization image. For many IT vendors and management consultants,
knowledge management is a <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>opportunity that enables them to take
advantage of the current interest in knowledge management. For many document
management vendors, the <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>toward knowledge management is natural due
to the fact that document management is an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>component of managing
explicit or documented knowledge. But for many vendors who jumped on the
bandwagon, knowledge management is simply replacing the word 'document'
by the word 'knowledge'. Raising the flag of knowledge management by many
vendors and management consultants without even understanding what knowledge
management is all about has created scepticism and led many people to believe
that knowledge management is nothing more than a management fad.</p>

<p>But while the debate continues on whether knowledge management is here
to stay, the majority of those interested in knowledge management are more
concerned with the real issues facing their organisations and prepared
to pay for a knowledge management solution. In the US, according to Schultz
(2000), knowledge spending is <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to increase by 19% annually from
the present $3.4 billion to $5.4 million. The <span>impetus</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>for knowledge management
for private sector organisations, as elaborated earlier, is a globalised
and fast-paced marketplace, knowledgeable customers who are spoilt for
choices. Firms <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to increase market share are striving to create
product loyalty among its customers through <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>a long-term relationship
with its customer and providing personalized services.</p>

<p>The public sector is also turning to knowledge management, having recognized
that they too face competition in funding and from alternative services.
Increasingly, customers in the public sector are demanding higher service
<span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> particularly in the area of e-government. Services, particularly
e-services, are <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to be available on a twenty-four hour, <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>days
a week basis, immediate <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>attention</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> simplified and one-stop
processing, <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>products and services and fast processing time. Knowledge
management is thus a natural solution for them to improve operations and
enhance customer service. Large organizations in the US have begun implementing
knowledge management as long as eight years ago.</p>

<p>In the consulting and professional services industry, the early pioneers
in knowledge management include Ernst and Young, Andersen Consulting, Arthur
Andersen, Price Waterhouse, etc. <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>management is not only strategic
to them in managing knowledge; it is also a core and booming <span>business</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
<a href="#foy99">Foy</a> (1999) highlighted a number of success stories of a number of consulting
and professional services firms. Their success stories <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>from success
in sharing best <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>through databases and virtual libraries, to innovative
<span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to encourage the sharing of ideals and experiences by staff.
The R&amp;D and technology intensive companies, like 3M, <span>Microsoft</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> Hewlett
Packard and Xerox are also pioneers in implementing knowledge management,
primarily to exchange experiences and transfer knowledge, and promoting
a creative and innovative work <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> In addition, they have been
offering knowledge management <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in recent years. Foy noted that
R&amp;D companies like Hoffmann-LaRoche, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Merck
have benefited from their knowledge management projects by hastening the
drug approval process, through 'better documentation' and 'knowledge sharing
<span>systems</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a href="#sch00">Schultz</a> (2000) reported that the US government
spending <span>constitutes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>30% of the overall knowledge management spending.
In particular, the US Army is one of the pioneers in the government to
implement knowledge management with success. Others are also following
closely behind. In Singapore, There is a strong interest from the public
sector in knowledge management. The strong presence of multinational companies
in Singapore has contributed to the strong interest in knowledge management.
<span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>number of government organizations including ministries and statuary
boards have embarked on knowledge management initiatives and some have
set-up knowledge management departments and created knowledge management
<span>positions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>newly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>launched <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/sci/is/km.htm">Master
of Science programme</a> in knowledge management in Nanyang Technological
University in Singapore has attracted large number of applicants.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Knowledge management as a concept is very attractive and to many organizations
is trendy and nice to be associated with. For many IT vendors and management
consultants, it is a <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>opportunity that should not be missed. But
while there is nothing <span>wrong</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>with making <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>sense out of knowledge
management, there is a need to go beyond the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and replace practice
of the word information to the word knowledge. Information management is
a subset of knowledge management and technology should be seen as an enabler
and part of infrastructure. For the majority of those interested in knowledge
management, the key drivers are organisational efficiency, maximising organisations
potential, competitive advantage, building a learning organisation and
managing intellectual capital. However, implementing knowledge management
is also not that easy. Organisations wanting to implement knowledge management
have to grabble with issues such as strategy, technology, organizational
culture and knowledge organization. But despite all these issues, companies
worldwide in both the private and public sector have shown keen interest
in knowledge management, judging from the amount of money <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to be
committed for knowledge management in the next few years.</p>

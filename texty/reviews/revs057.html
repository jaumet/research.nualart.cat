<h3>Just what the doctor ordered?&nbsp;</h3>


<h4>Welsh, S., Anagnostelis. B. &amp; Cooke, A. <em>Finding and using health and medical information on the Internet</em>. London: Aslib-IMI, 2001.  ISBN 0-85142-384-1  £29.99 (Aslib members £24.00)</h4>


<p>Reports of patients entering their doctor's surgery armed with a pile of
printouts from the Internet (<a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/319/7223/1476">Muir
Gray's syndrome of 'la maladie du grand print-out'</a>), though primarily
anecdotal in nature, attest to the pervasive influence of the medium on
health care information.&nbsp;&nbsp; Patients need skills in identifying
relevant materials and understanding their contents.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clinicians
need to moderate and appraise conflicting messages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile
the intermediary, whether health librarian or consumer information provider,
is frequently seen as the guide along the highway.</p>

<p>In this context this new handbook is to be warmly welcomed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
From the very title we see an emphasis on the active - the finding and
using - rather than the reflective.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of the chapter headings
demonstrate a similar task-oriented focus eg. 'Finding out about research
funding and research projects', 'Keeping up to date', 'Searching the Internet
strategically'.&nbsp;&nbsp; With 22 chapters, arranged in five easily navigable
Sections - Internet quick tour, Finding information on the Internet, Communication,
Evaluation and Taking Control, this 317 page book covers the essentials
of using the Internet including a brief chapter on creating your own Web
pages.&nbsp;&nbsp; Frequent screen shots and helpful boxes and tables yield
dividends for both serendipitous and purposive user alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This approach is achieved at the expense of detailed referencing with additional
reading being indicative rather than comprehensive.</p>


<p>What is particularly impressive is the seamless integration of health content
with technical medium.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many books on health on the internet
struggle to manage the schizoid tension between equipping the reader to
drive the highway and pointing out the scenic landscapes encountered en
route.&nbsp;&nbsp; This book successfully reconciles such a tension.&nbsp;&nbsp;
For example, Chapter 10 on search engines and, indeed the subsequent chapter
on meta-search engines, uses a realistic search example of 'zinc gluconate
lozenges for treating colds in children' to illustrate contrasting or complementary
features of the various search engines.&nbsp;&nbsp; Practical tips and
summary tables continue the emphasis on 'doing'.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even for someone
who uses health information from the Internet on a day-to-day basis there
is much to stimulate and to expand the horizons.</p>

<p>An inevitable consequence of the attempt to capture the wealth of the
Internet via the print medium is the number of links that pass their 'sell
by date' within the life expectancy of each edition.&nbsp;&nbsp; This book
is no exception and its position within the volatile domain of health seems
to exacerbate this problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; My own casual research on the links
of an Evidence Based Practice resource guide suggests that as many as 30%
of URLs may be modified within an eighteen month period.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
is attested to by this book's chapter on 'Using the Internet to support
evidence-based healthcare' where revisions since going to press include
the migration of the mailbase discussion lists to Jiscmail and the appearance
of single domain names to replace unmemorable academic file paths e.g.
<a href="http://www.tripdatabase.com/">www.tripdatabase.com</a>
and <a href="http://www.nettingtheevidence.org.uk/">www.nettingtheevidence.org.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Just as it would be unfair to to judge a photograph, essentially a snapshot,
by the standards of a video it would be invidious to pass too harsh a judgement
based on currency alone &ndash; this book deservedly sets a new standard for Internet
handbooks in the health domain.&nbsp;&nbsp; As a contributor to two of
its rival titles I find myself wishing, futilely as it appears, that this
expert team had not delivered such an impressive masterclass!&nbsp;&nbsp;
I shall take scant consolation in the fact that the book's provenance,
from the ASLIB portfolio, makes it more likely to reach information professionals
than the 100,000 plus members of the medical profession in the UK!</p>

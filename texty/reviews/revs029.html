<p>A close observer of publication dates will note that one of
these books has been sitting on my 'to be reviewed' shelf for
rather longer than it ought to have been. However, perhaps that
has turned out to be for the best, since it offers the chance to
examine three books that deal with the concept of the digital
library. Rather ironic, to have so many 'old-fashioned' artefacts
like books that deal with such a modern idea. Two of the books
(Ar ms and Borgman) are in the same MIT Press series on Digital
Libraries and Electronic Publishing (the series editor is Arms),
while the third, and earlier publication is in the Morgan Kaufman
Series in Multimedia Information and Systems, edited by another
well-known figure in the digital libraries field, Ed Fox of
Virginia Tech. </p>

<p>As might be expected when three books deal with essentially
the same subject area, there is some overlap - this is most
readily seen in Arms and Lesk: for example, both deal with text
conversion standards, information retrieval (text and image),
usability issues, multimedia, archival concerns, economics, and
intellectual property. However, they cover these topics in
different ways, and each includes topics that they other omits:
for example, Lesk deals to a greater extent with digital library
initiatives around the world, while Arms says more about
meta-data and about organizational issues. Lesk's work has more
and better illustrations, a better index (although neither is a
perfect model), and a bibliography. Shamefully, Arms provides
neither footnotes nor a bibliography, leaving his readers
scrambling to find, 'A 1998 article in the New York Times&#133;'
or other, similarly disguised citations, as well as the
appropriate sources for the numerous standards he mentions - how
the publishers can have allowed this is beyond me. </p>

<p>Although these two books cover much of the same ground, they
are complementary and both will be of value anyone seeking an
understanding of what the digital library idea means today. For
the student, Lesk's book is probably the most useful and it could
be used as a standard text on the subject. Arms's work is also of
value to students, but perhaps of more value to the library
manager seeking to map out the future of the library in whatever
community he or she serves. </p>

<p>Borgman's book differs from the other two in adopting what she
calls 'a social informatics perspective' in her examination of
this phenomenon. In my opinion 'social informatics' is a
particularly obscure term, since it does not convey what is meant
by its adoption. 'Informatics' is from the French, informatique,
meaning simply (according to Larousse) 'data processing' - adding
'social' clarifies this not at all, since it seems to convey the
idea of some kind of collective data- processing. What Borgman
actually means is not entirely clear: </p>

<blockquote>
    &quot;Social informatics&quot; is an emerging research
    area that brings together the concerns of information,
    computer, and social scientists with those in the domains of
    study.
</blockquote>

<p>but I take it that the term is intended to convey the
    idea of the social and organizational impact of computers and
    information systems.</p>

<p>To say 'adopting a social perspective' would have served just
as well. And, indeed, that is what emerges in what is an
excellent text - excellent in more ways than one: where Arms
provides us with no bibliography, Borgman gives us one of forty
pages, along with a much better index. Part of this significant
body of literature is Borgman's own work in the fields of
human-computer interaction, digital libraries, and on-line
searching - along with her consultancy work in Eastern Europe
under the auspices of the Soros Foundation Open Society
Institute. The result is a rich, well-informed text, which deals
with digital libraries as social phenomena, as well as with some
of the technological aspects dealt with by Arms and Lesk. For
example, Borgman also touches on the economics of electronic
publishing, on retrieval systems and on text-encoding standards,
but her analysis of these topics feeds into the intended, more
socially informed perspective. </p>

<p>What makes Borgman's work different, and in my opinion, more
interesting than that of either Arms or Lesk, is not only the
social perspective but also the concept of the 'global
information infrastructure', found in the sub-title. She presents
a serious analysis of the concept of 'infrastructure' in Chapter
1, based upon Star and Ruhelder's eight dimensions of
embeddedness, transparency, scope, learnt nature, practice
conventions, standardisation, installed base and visibility on
breakdown, and shows how these dimensions are applicable to an
information infrastructure. Borgman believes, rightly, I think,
that the adoption of technological innovation is a matter
neither of revolutionary or evolutionary change but of what she
terms 'co-evolution', that is change in social and organizational
practices along with the adoption by people of such innovations
as work for them. This process results not only in changes in
work practices, for example, but also in the innovations
themselves as they are adapted to work practices. On the basis of
this analysis, a 'global information infrastructure' or GII is: </p>

<blockquote>
     '...a technical framework of computing and
    communications technologies, information content, services
    and people, all of which interact in complex and often
    unpredictable ways.' 
</blockquote>

<p>An equal concern with definition is shown in the second
chapter, where the problematical concept of a 'digital library'
is discussed: is a digital library an institution like a
university library, which happens to enable access to its
resources digitally, or is it distributed, digitised content to
which digital access is enabled. The first, says, Borgman, is
favoured by librarians, the second by researchers into the
digital library. My own feeling is that the distinction is
disappearing and cannot persist: the institutional base of the
digital library cannot persist because users have access from
their office desks, their student halls and their homes to
digital resources well beyond the bounds of any institution to
which they may belong and not necessarily requiring access to be
negotiated by any library. </p>

<p>This leaves, of course, the question, 'What, then, happens to
the institutions we call libraries?' (a question I have tried to
answer, at least in part, elsewhere (Wilson, 1998)) and Borgman
debates this issue in Chapter 7, 'Whither, or wither, libraries',
but, to a degree, leaves the answer to both questions hanging.
Libraries are social and cultural phenomena as well as
institutions for access to information and, rightly, Borgman
believes that their roles and functions need to be re-thought.
How they might be rethought is less than clear, however, and she
concludes that: </p>

<blockquote>
    'In developing new approaches to managing distributed
    information resources, it should be possible to draw on the
    best theories, principles and practices of libraries,
    archives and museums. The fundamental goal is to balance
    cooperation and competition in implementing social strategies
    that continue to support cultural values for a digital age.'
</blockquote>

<p>From which I take it that she believes that the principles of
librarianship will survive in the digital age, since they are the
principles of information organization and access, but that the
institution of library will need to map out new functions in
order to complement new forms of information access and services
and, having done so, will find itself competing for users and,
hence, resources in the global information infrastructure.</p>

<p>Naturally, some things are happening between Chapter 2 and
Chapter 7 - in the intervening chapters, Borgman considers the
nature of access to information in digital libraries, including
topics such as meta-data, which are covered by Arms and Lesk;
electronic publishing in general, and scholarly publishing in
particular; why digital libraries, with the present state of the
technology, are so hard to use and what might make them easier to
use. Most of this last chapter (i.e., Chapter 6) is concerned
with setting out a research agenda under various headings. Enough
topics are mentioned to keep several research teams busy for some
years to come: some of them are the old questions in a new light
- such as how to improve upon IR systems to make them both easier
to use and more effective (a lost cause in my opinion, given the
dead end of the present research paradigm), and other issues,
such as the transferability of information from pre-digital
library systems to digital libraries, which are brought about by
the existence of this new phenomenon.</p>

<p>Chapter 8 deals with the issue of 'Acting locally, thinking
globally', that is, how to ensure that 'global' information
resources are <em>accessible</em> globally - in other words how
to achieve interoperability, when resources may be prepared in
different languages and in different character sets, and so
forth. What standards will be required, based upon those that are
now available, to ensure the existence of the true global
library? The final chapter takes this further by asking how the
technology available is to be scaled up, how access is to be
provided, and how to transfer the technology and services to
'...parts of the world with different traditions and practices
than those of the Group of Seven major industrialised nations
that laid the technical and political framework for a global
information infrastructure.'</p>

<p>This last point is perhaps the most significant challenge:
those of us who use the Internet every day and live in conditions
that enable and foster its use, may forget that we are privileged
and that, as a recent correspondent (Grosser, 2000) to the pages
of <em>Communications of the ACM</em> reminds us, 'Half of the
total [of the world's population] have never seen a computer or
even made a telephone call.' and that more than two-thirds are
illiterate - there is a great deal to be done before any truly
'global digital library' can have any relevance for the greater
proportion of humanity, and most of what needs to be done has
nothing to do with computer technologies.</p>

      <P><B>Tasks</B></P>
      <P>There are a wide range of personal bibliographic software packages. In 
      general, they are designed to assist in the following tasks:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>manual cataloguing of bibliographic references relating to a 
        student's or academic's personal research areas/topics; 
        <LI>automated collection and organisation of references from 
        bibliographic databases, library catalogues, etc; 
        <LI>search and retrieval of bibliographic subsets 
        <LI>integration with word-processing software to automatically insert 
        and format citations and bibliographies; 
        <LI>formatting of references according to particular bibliographic 
        styles (e.g. MLA, Chicago, individual journals) and also formats for 
        exporting to other packages and for data-sharing. </LI></UL>
      <P><B>Data types</B></P>
      <P>To a large degree all bibliographic packages worth mentioning will 
      claim to perform all of these tasks. To a large degree all bibliographic 
      packages have been designed with a primary focus on the science community 
      (you can tell by, amongst other things, the range of science-related 
      journals and databases for which citation styles are included). This is 
      strange given that the humanities community is usually perceived as a 
      community of book worms. However, the bottom line is that, whether 
      science, social science, or humanities, bibliographic databases should 
      have to contend with a mixture of at least the following printed formats, 
      regardless of content:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>monographs 
        <LI>edited works and their essays 
        <LI>journal articles 
        <LI>conference proceedings and their essays 
        <LI>theses 
        <LI>unpublished work 
        <LI>magazine and newspaper articles 
        <LI>public email messages (e.g. from discussion lists) 
        <LI>Web-based publications (Web sites and their parts; electronic 
        journals and their articles; etc.) </LI></UL>
      <P>Occasionally one finds a bibliographic database which can only deal 
      with monographs, journal articles, and essays in edited works. Ignore 
      them. They assume too much about the nature of your research.</P>
      <P><B>Flexibility</B></P>
      <P>If a bibliographic database is to be useful to a wide range of users 
      (i.e. not just sections of the academic community such as medicine or 
      sociology or history) then the user should be able to customize the 
      package in certain key areas to conform the package to the user's own 
      research area and the citation demands of the user's subject community. 
      The following key areas are a good start:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>adding or customising of reference types (e.g. add a type for 
        manuscripts and other documents of the pre-print era) 
        <LI>adding or customising of fields within reference types (e.g. decide 
        that the field 'journal abbreviation' is redundant and a field for 
        'published reviews' would be more useful) 
        <LI>adding of further style formats and editing of existing ones (e.g. 
        style for <I>Computers &amp; Texts</I> or style to print out all 
        references by keyword heading, or changing the way in which it formats 
        references in HTML) 
        <LI>customising how the software formats citations within the text and 
        footnotes as well as in the final bibliography </LI></UL>
      <P><B>Humanities</B></P>
      <P>When looking to use a personal bibliographic database for research 
      within the humanities it is worth spending some time considering the range 
      of bibliographic material with which you will work, sources from which it 
      comes (especially the electronic sources), the range of styles in which it 
      is cited (short citations in footnotes, full bibliography, possibly 
      in-text citations, different journals and publications styles demanded). 
      In addition, it is worth considering the usefulness of the following 
      features which are often particularly relevant to humanities research:</P>
      <UL>
        <LI>Will the package easily download references from external databases 
        or easily convert downloaded references for importing into the personal 
        database? (look particularly for Z39.50 capability) 
        <LI>Do the record-types reflect the types of publications consulted and 
        cited in the humanities? 
        <LI>Do the records include fields for electronic sources? 
        <LI>Is it able to handle common humanities citation styles (or can 
        styles be easily adapted)? 
        <LI>Does it output HTML or provide an easy and cross-platform means of 
        sharing a bibliography? </LI></UL>
      <P><B>Comparative reviews</B></P>
      <P>The following are useful online sites for comparative reviews of 
      bibliographic packages (with links to demonstration copies):</P>

      <P><B><FONT size=2>Platform:</FONT></B><FONT size=2> Window 95, 98, and 
      NT4</FONT></P>
      <P><B>Description:</B> Biblioscape 3.3 can import references from 
      web-based bibliographic databases and library catalogues directly into its 
      database. Beside a powerful set of features for editing, exploring, 
      filtering and sorting records Biblioscape allows its user to directly 
      publish their databases on the web from a PC permanently connected to the 
      Internet. This feature allows other users to remotely browse the 
      collection or, if it is desired, to add or modify records - a very useful 
      feature for scholars involved in collaborative projects. Using the 
      'BiblioSidekick' tool whilst word-processing, references can be dragged 
      and dropped from a small floating window directly into documents. The 
      pre-defined output styles offered by Biblioscape include MLA, Chicago and 
      APA - most of those offered are for scientific journals - but it offers 
      the tools to add more.</P>

      <P><B>Notes:</B> Includes reasonably powerful filter utilty for importing 
      records. Has a reasonably full set of publication types and the 
      possibility of including URLs. The available styles have a heavy bias 
      towards the sciences but does include a style creator. Includes HTML 
      output and the database can be dynamically served over the Web. Can be 
      integrated into Word/WordPerfect and cross-references to documents can be 
      added to references. Well worth considering. </P>

      <P><B><FONT size=2>Platform:</FONT></B><FONT size=2> MacOS</FONT></P>
      <P><B>Description:</B> Bookends offers a flexible, and sophisticated means 
      of saving, retrieving and formatting references for bibliographies or 
      footnotes. Additionally, files referenced in the database, such as images, 
      movie clips, text files and web pages can be displayed or opened from 
      within the database. Bookends contains an add-in for Microsoft Word 6 and 
      Word 98 which lets the user access and cite from the database directly 
      from within the word processor. Chicago, MLA and APA styles are 
      represented and also HTML output. With password-controlled access 
      Bookends' bibliographical databases can be searched remotely through the 
      Web. It is also possible, by means of a form, to allow users to add 
      references to a Bookends database through the Web.</P>

      of which can be altered by users to suit their needs; it enables the 
      production of formatted bibliographies in many widely-used humanities 
      styles. Databases for research notes and mailing lists can also be 
      designed, and it will automatically format bibliographic footnotes. Some 
      import facilities are provided. The Windows version of Library Master will

      publication type, provides searching and sorting of records (including 
      hierarchical keywords), imports records downloaded from external databases 
      (and the distributor's site contains a number of freely available import 
      filters), and formats bibliographies in a range of customizable styles 
      apart from, and within standard word-processing software. Papyrus can also 
      scan word-processed documents for citations.</P>

 <h3>Introna, L.D. <i>Management, information and power: a narrative of the
    involved manager.</i> Macmillan, London (1997). xii + 209 pp. ISBN
    0-333-69870-3 [No price given]</h3>
    
    <p>Lucas Introna (Lecturer in Information Systems at the London School of
      Economics and Political Science) has produced an interesting and timely
      book: timely because the information systems field is involved in major
      debates over the nature of such systems and, particularly, how to design
      them for effective management support. The author describes his book as &quot;...a
      rough draft.&quot; (p. x) and this shows to some degree in the nature of
      some of the arguments.</p>
    
	 <p>The aim of the book is clearly set out:</p>
	
   <blockquote>This book is an attempt to rearticulate the idea of the manager;
      the manager in<i> the world; not as the thinking, rational and purposive
      manager but as the </i>involved<i> manager.  </i>(p. ix) </blockquote>
	  
    <p>This aim stems from Iltrona's own experience as a manager when,
      following completion of the MBA and having absorbed and tried to apply all
      of the neat, rational theorizing, he found that his everyday work: <i>&quot;...seemed
      messy, unalyzable, unarticulatable, unsolvable and so on&quot;</i> and
      <i>&quot;No matter how hard one tried to be the manager that they theory
      said one ought to be, these eloquent models seemed to crumble in the face
      of the everyday 'getting the job done'&quot; </i>(p. viii).
      Exploring this problem of the lack of fit between theory and practice led
      the author to the work of Heidegger, Gadamer, Ashby, Clegg, and others who
      provide alternative views of what it is to <i>be</i>, the nature of
      information, the idea of systems, and the nature of power, that provide
      the structure for the book.</p>
    
    <p>The underpinning idea of the book is that two fundamentally different
      world-views exist in the management literature: the dominant view for many
      years, which has governed a great deal of research and management
      consultancy practice, is that of management as a scientifically-based,
      rational process. The alternative view, espoused by Iltrona, is that of
      the involved manager who has his being, <i>as manager</i>, already <i>in</i>
      the world - already always involved and, for that reason, already aware of
      much that needs to be done and how to do it, already aware of the next
      decision to be taken and taking that decision on the basis of his or her
      <i>understanding</i> of the every day, work-a-day world.</p>
    
    <p>This view, generally set against the alternative, is pursued (following
      the introduction) through six chapters that deal with the manager involved
      in the world, information as understanding, management and its derivation
      from the Latin word <i>manus</i>, and the implications of that origin,
      power as a network of force relations, managing information, and the
      implications of the general thesis. </p>
    
    <p>The book can be recommended to students, researchers, teachers and
      practitioners in the fields of information management and information
      systems because it is an important contribution to the on-going debate on
      the nature of information and information systems. It is important because
      it adopts a phenomenological perspective on the nature of the every-day
      reality of the manager, and an hermeneutic approach to the nature of
      information and its use, that are a useful antidote to what I believe
      (with Iltrona) to have been the failure of the rational, <i>scientistic</i>
      models and theories of the dominant ideas in information systems.</p>

RM: only vertical: Database -> Record -> Fields -> Subfields in names 

4.3 Horizontal links: between databases, records, list entries 
En: no

4.4 Hierarchical links (es. thesaurus, mother/sons records, text/notecards)

En: no 
Term Lists can be regarded as autonomous (see dedicated section): their content can be imported from external text, updated from records, directly edited. Field data and list contents (sort of look-up) can be "crossed" in output to replace text: secondary title (journal) field + journal list (with up to three abbreviations 
RM: no
some fields generate indexes which are not only derived, i.e. automatically created and updated, as they can have indipendent entries and synonyms and can be directly edited

fields bear "step" displayed name: total number is fixed max 38; fields are identified by the number they bear in the Generic RT which determinates their position: number is fixed across all the reference types (workforms); some fields (names, journal titles, pages, URL, keywords) have peculiarities (internal coding, indexing, output formatting, sort...) that cannot loose or lend to other fields;
2: yes, given abovementioned constraints, can add, delete, move, rename fields; attributes cannot be changed
3: yes, up to three
if a field is deleted from RT, existing record content is put to corresponding Generic RT field renamed;

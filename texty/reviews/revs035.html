<h3>Van Lieshout, Marc, Egyedi, Tineke M. &amp; Bijker, Wiebe E. <i>editors.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Social learning technologies. The introduction of multimedia in education. </i>Aldershot: <a href="http://www.ashgate.com/">Ashgate Publishing</a>, 2001. ISBN 0-7546-1409-3 £45.00</h3>

      <p>This volume is one outcome of an European Union Project called <a 
      href="http://www.rcss.ed.ac.uk/research/slim.html">Social Learning in 
      Multi-Media</a>. The book is divided into three parts. Part 1 addresses 
      the conceptual framework of social learning and its application to the use 
      of multimedia in education. Part 2 presents case studies of the process of 
      introducing multimedia into education. Part 3 presents a series of 
      comparative analyses in which the findings of the individual case studies 
      are examined and analysed as a whole in the context of the theoretical 
      framework introduced in Part 1.</p>
	   
      <p>Multimedia are defined as:</p>
	  
      <blockquote><i>...the (simultaneous) use of different types of 
        (electronic) media, such as text, sound and (moving) images [...] When 
        discussing the meaning of multimedia for education, I want to focus on 
        the meaning of information as well as interaction, communication, for 
        the learning process (p.13)</i>.</blockquote>
		
<p>Thence 'multimedia' is regarded as interchangeable with 'information and communication technologies'. In defining the concept of social learning the authors are keen to point out that (in its action-oriented aspect) the term has similarities with learning but should not be wholly identified with it. Social learning has more to do with the reflexive component of social practices:</p> 
	  
      <blockquote><i>Social learning (as analytical concept)...does not relate 
        to an actor, or a collective (or society at large). It simply equates 
        the presence of reflexivity (some might say: intended or unintended 
        feedback) within social practices with learning (p.55)</i>.</blockquote>
		
		<p>In any introduction of information and communication technology the authors maintain that attention ought to be paid not only to the technology but also to the social practice in which the technology will become embedded.  In sum:</p>

      <blockquote><i>...The central questions in this volume are: In what 
        manner is multimedia used in the education sector? Which mechanisms 
        affect the introduction, development and diffusion of innovative 
        multimedia uses in the field of education (pp.4-5) </i></blockquote>
		

      <p><i>Innofusion</i> is the concept used to explore this process of introducing information and communications technology. It is a conflation of innovation and diffusion and seeks to convey that these processes occur simultaneously. The concept is cashed out in terms of 'appropriation', 'configuration', and 'translation'. Very briefly although users are constrained and 'configured' to behave in certain ways in their interactions with technical designs users can and do appropriate and adapt technology to local circumstances. Over time translation also occurs when for example the original intentions of a project are translated into new intentions. The authors then proceed to evaluate the success and failure of a multimedia project with recourse to "the manner in which the process of change is incorporated into the social practice" (p.59). This manner might be predominantly experimental or predominantly controlled or as is most often the case a combination of both. Such processes of change may or may not involve social learning. For the authors, social learning in the introduction of multimedia is evidence that progress has occurred.</p>
	  
 
      <p>Part 2 contains eight studies conducted by researchers on the project 
      in different European countries:</p> 
	  
      <blockquote><i>Most of the cases focus on a multimedia project. They 
        cover a variety of issues, educational settings and multimedia uses. The 
        'learners' addressed range from children to adults; the educational 
        settings vary from primary school to the home and the university 
        setting; the initiators of multimedia use are educational institutes, 
        government bodies and, sometimes, commercial companies; the multimedia 
        used ranges from stand-alone software for private use to communication 
        technologies for distance teaching; and the issues of concern range from 
        gender aspects to economic issues (p.7) </i>.</blockquote>
		
      <p>An overview of the UK case study "Learning in Cable-School: The Use of 
      Networked ICTs in an Educational Context" serves as an example of the 
      general approach taken. This study documents the history and 'failure' of 
      a project in the north of Britain. The case is based on interviews with 
      two teachers in one of the schools and with the manager of the project. 
      The intended aims of the project were to implement an IT infrastructure 
      linking schools around the region. The cable-based Internet service would 
      provide web authoring tools, ftp and electronic mail software as well as 
      some simple teaching resources including class worksheets and quizzes. 
      While the former were intended for use by teachers to develop and download 
      materials the latter were aimed at facilitating inter-school collaboration 
      and discussion through the shared development of worksheets. What the 
      author traces in the case is how over time the IT infrastructure develops 
      separated from those who were aware of its 'pedagogic potential'. As a 
      result of interactions between a number of different groups and events 
      e.g. a local government re-organisation:</p> 
	  
      <blockquote>CableCo developed the Cable-School project as a means of 
        <b>inter alia</b> 'proving' the concept of networked communications to 
        the local councils within the area to be served.</blockquote>
		
      <p>The Internet service in effect becomes a marketing strategy for CableCo 
      rather than a pedagogic tool <i>per se</i>. Social learning is identified 
      as occurring however in the way e-mail is adopted by teachers in local 
      settings, leading them to explore the use of other internet tools such as 
      web authoring and ftp software. A theory of social learning is also used 
      to explain how the failures of the project in delivering a system intended 
      to provide technical and pedagogic support can be related to the social 
      being separated from the technical and the technical being separated from 
      the pedagogic. Teachers in schools did appropriate the technology but on 
      an independent basis. So although innovations and local solutions 
      unanticipated by the designers did occur such innovations were developed 
      in isolation from other teachers. This leads the author to characterise 
      the situation as one of 'the social learning of independence' (p.97). In 
      conclusion the technological infrastructure but not social practice had 
      been addressed. The project's successes and failures can be accounted for 
      in terms of social learning. In terms of its original intentions to 
      combine ICT and pedagogic content the project failed but was also 
      successfully in the aspects appropriated by teachers. Of primary interest 
      in the context of the book however is the manner in which the project 
      failed. In this case Because the social context for the technology was not 
      addressed and hence social learning as part of a reflexive educational 
      Practice did not occur.</p>
	   
      <p>Part 3 contains a series of chapters that synthesize comparative 
      analyses of the case studies in the context of the theoretical framework. 
      An overview of The key features and objectives of the cases are provided 
      and processes of infusion And social learning described. Comments are also 
      made on how the successes and failures of projects "relates to The manner 
      in which the process of change is incorporated into the social practice" 
      (p.59). In terms of the 'Cable-School' example the configuration Of the 
      school setting fails because of the lack of uptake of all components of 
      the Intended system e.g. worksheets. However there is appropriation of 
      e-mail/Internet. Instead the school server installed is translated from a 
      device for developing collaborative Worksheets into a communication device 
      oriented around discussion and community self-help. Similar elements of 
      the theoretical framework are also presented in the context of other case 
      studies.</p> 
	  
      <p>A separate chapter deals specifically with how infusion processes 
      surrounding the introduction of Multimedia can be improved and the 
      "mechanisms that drive and hamper infusion" addressed (p.265). These 
      mechanisms include factors intrinsic to infusion such as teachers and 
      institutions As well as factors extrinsic to infusion processes such as 
      markets. </p>
	  
      <p>In a further chapter the authors revisit the concept of social learning 
      and seek to identify "How reflexivity is constituted in the cases under 
      study". This they do by plotting dimensions of each case study on a 
      spectrum from mode of experimentation to mode of control. The Cable-School 
      initiative is characterized as "submissive experimentation", what one 
      might call weak experimentation with experimentation being the dominant 
      mode in most of the dimensions (e.g. open to change, absence of boundaries 
      and exploratory) With an even balance of process and product but with 
      control hierarchical and closed. The authors are then at pains to point 
      out whether: </p>
	  
      <blockquote><i>...there is a correlation between success and failure, 
        the mode of experimentation and control, and technology and education 
        (p.303)</i>. </blockquote>
		
      <p>The authors' thesis is that the success and failure of a project are so 
      related. The Cable School project failed in terms of the original 
      objective of delivering shared teacher development of worksheets but was a 
      success in regard to delivering an information infrastructure and 
      stimulating communication and discussion. These successes and failures can 
      be related to the mixed modes of experimentation and control that help to 
      characterise the manner in which the multimedia was introduced. The 
      authors' final recommendations are: </p>
	  
      <ul>
        <li>More is learned from failure than from success</li> 
        <li>In the development, implementation and application of technologies 
        various groups are involved</li> 
        <li>Multimedia form and content are inextricably linked</li></ul>
		
      <p>This is a thought-provoking volume that is both theoretically-driven 
      and empirically grounded. It should be read by all those seriously 
      interested in the effective introduction of information and communications 
      technology in education.</p>

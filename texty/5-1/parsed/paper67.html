<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Every <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>each of us is forced to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>many different vital problems 
connected with working and training, recreation and <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>children</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> the 
family budget and hobby. For decision making in every <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span><span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> it is 
necessary to have as complete and recent information about these things and 
circumstances as possible. The <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of information sources and seeking 
<span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> methods of verification of its reliability and correspondence with 
earlier data, the ways of evaluation of relevance and <span>utility</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>
for problem <span>resolution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>are the factors characterizing human information 
behaviour. The problems of information seeking in context were con0ered at the 
overpast conference where scientists from many countries of Europe, America, and 
Australia presented around forty reports and a variety of other works at the 
stands. This paper argues some from the numerous ideas and opinions of the 
participants of the conference, which were discussed during their speeches and 
con0erations. I have tried to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>some proposed ideas, models and 
methods with the aim to evaluate their <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>usefulness for the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of 
information <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span><span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
<h2>Conception of context</h2>
<p>There are many investigations of different information and 
information-seeking problems but the conference was devoted to the problem of 
information seeking in context, i.e., in a <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span><span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>when the 
information <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>problem appears and the process of its <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>is realized. 
As one can see, the notion of context in itself is not defined <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>now, 
there is a great variety of conceptions and <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>to its <span>description</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> There 
are also many <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>whether it is necessary to introduce an <span>exact</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>
definition of context or it is enough to <span>limit</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>ourselves by <span>approximate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>
reasoning about its content, whether context develops during some time, and 
whether it is discrete or continuous, what way may be used for defining an edge 
between the notion of context and other concepts such as <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>or event, and 
so on.</p>
<p>Context of information seeking may be described by means of many different 
<span>parameters</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>such as the time and place of appearance of information need, the 
time for information seeking, types of participants of the seeking process, for 
example, their demographic, social, professional, educational and behavioural 
<span>characteristics</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> the purpose of information seeking, the <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>task for which 
this information is looked for, the processes and situations of information 
seeking, and many others. There is a great <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of different context versions 
presented in explorations of the reporters. For example, <a 
href="#book2">Brezillon and Saker (1998)</a> study 
the notion of context in the application for behaviour of the subway operator 
when an incident <span>occurs</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> <a href="#book3">Gorman 
(1998)</a> researches information seeking of <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>care physicians, <a 
href="#book12">van de Wijngaert (1998)</a> con0ers 
the information behaviour of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>when they decide which movies they can go 
to.</p>
<p>So, there are many points of view regarding what context is, but, not going 
into <span>details</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> it should be necessary to emphasize that the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of a 
notion of context allows to pass from study of some ideal process of information 
seeking, which is executed by someone under undetermined conditions, to the 
research of realistic information-seeking behaviour <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>into account both 
specific cases and their influence on the information seeking process itself, to 
the <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span><span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> information sources, methods of evaluation of 
information <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> reliability, and relevance. Using such an approach, it 
becomes possible to organize addressed information support to particular users 
with their <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>needs under their specific conditions.</p>
<h2>Some theoretical concepts and their <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>use</h2>
<p>The papers <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>at the conference submit both theoretical and applied 
<span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of the participants. It is <span>impossible</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>in detail all these 
explorations, so this review is <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>which may be used for 
<span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>design and realization of information <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>system.</p>
<p>There are many theoretical problems which are discussed in the papers by <a

href="#book4">Kuhlthau (1998)</a>, <a 
href="#book10">Spink (1998)</a>, <a

href="#book9">Solomon (1998)</a>, <a 
href="#book1">Audunson (1998)</a>, and others. The 
fellows develop general concepts, propose different models of processes

<p>It seems that the idea of <span>utility</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of concept, <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of an <span>exact</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>definition 
of notion, is very constructive because concept unlike <span>exact</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>definition suggests 
not only <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>but the way of exploration and interpretation of a 
<span>phenomenon</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> Moreover, there is a <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>to choose a concept just conformed 
to the aims of a present task. It may become a comfortable research 
instrumentation for getting interesting results.</p>

<h3>Concept of information</h3>

<p>The notion of information is one of the basic concepts. Researchers study 
several ideas of it and everyone seems to refer to one of the two polar types 
with more or less admissions. The first approach proposes to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>
information as objective and user as something like an input-output device for 
this information without any impact on its sense, at that the nature of 
information using does not stand on circumstances of this process. Events and 
processes of outness are in the high light. Another approach views information 
as something created by a man on the basis of some received data and his own 
knowledge. In this case, the sense of created information <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>on conditions 
of its formation and its author, i.e., on context.</p>

<h3>Approaches to <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>system organization</h3>

<p>Of course, the above-described concepts of information are simplified to the 
<span>limit</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>but in fact, <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>his <span>choice</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> an information system designer chooses the 
<span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>principle of his <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>product construction; this product may be oriented 
either to a system or to a user.</p>

<p>The first approach is described by a neatly defined purpose of construction 
of a <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>system, formalized process descriptions, <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>tough 
cause-and-effect <span>connections</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>user of this <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>system and his information 
needs are known exactly; a user is not con0ered as a component of this system. 
The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>system function is information processing; at that, generally such a 
system contains specialized information which may be rarely received from other 
sources. If a system was constructed in accordance with these principles, it 
does not <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>on the context of its use; in fact, it is initially connected 
with one or a few certain <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> These <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>are hardwired into such a 
system. So, this system may be used only under certain circumstances which were 
covered previously as far back as at the stage of system <span>design</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span></
>
<p>This approach is not acceptable for decision of low-structured problems when 
a user has to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>received data using his own knowledge and experience in 
accordance with a <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>context.</p>

<p>The second approach assumes that the purpose of system creation is formulated 
in general, a <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>user himself and his information needs are only partly 
known. So, a user is con0ered as an active component of information system. 
The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>system function is information seeking according to user needs; at 
that, information has a common nature and generally <span>speaking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>may be received 
from other sources. The ways and results of using such a system <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>on the 
context of its employment, furthermore, conditions, situations, types of users, 
and their <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>may be very different and can transform during the system 
life-cycle.</p>

<p>Thereby, the mainframe principle of system designing is defined by <span>sorts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of 
problems for which a <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>system is meant. But, doing this <span>choice</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> a designer 
precisely circumscribes the system usability and therefore the nature of 
information which will be located in the system, and the rules of its 
organization, as well as the <span>algorithms</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of information retrieval and processing, 
and the forms of result <span>representation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Speaking about methodologies of information system designing, the 
participants of the conference <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>the opinion that existent procedures and 
instrumentation are applicable mostly in the elaboration of system-oriented 
products. They have noted that it is necessary to further the development of 
conceptual <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>methods of construction for user-oriented 
information <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>Problem-solving processes</h3>

<p>Among the theoretical explorations delivered at the conference, the research 
of problem-solving processes occupies important place (e.g., <a 
href="#book13">Wilson (1998)</a>, <a 
href="#book4">Kuhlthau (1998),</a> <a 
href="#book11">Vakkari (1998),</a> and others). The 
researchers <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>these processes, from problem authentication to decision 
making and its <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>estimation. They produce diverse models of these 
processes and also procedures connected with information seeking and using at 
every stage of problem decision.</p>

<p>Generalizing the ideas of the participants of the conference and many 
references to earlier explorations, it seems possible to detail three basic 
stages of problem-solving processes, which <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>differ by the ways of 
working with information.</p>

<p>At the first stage, knowledge about the problem is rather common and 
fragmentary. The solver cannot precisely formulate the problem as yet and, 
<span>respectively</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> is unable to define what specific information is necessary for 
<span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>his problem. At this stage, his purpose is to review and to learn as 
much as possible various information for problem <span>perception</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> For this purpose, 
he uses all <span>sorts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of data from many diverse sources, <span>discusses</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>his problem with 
other people; at the same time, he has no plan of his actions and <span>exact</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>criteria 
for the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of necessary lights as yet. As a result of this activity, at 
the first stage he has to get wise to the content of his problem and to 
construct the methods of its decision.</p>

<p>At the second stage, the solver has a more precise and structured notion of 
his problem. He visualizes the content and possible sources of necessary 
information and executes <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and task-oriented seeking. He is able to define 
relevance of retrieved information by explicit criteria. As a result of this 
stage, he has to propose a solution of his problem.</p>

<p>At the <span>third</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> final stage of problem-solving process, the solver examines the 
received decision. To that end, he looks for additional information related to 
the theme of study, tries to confirm the regularity of decision. Information 
seeking is pretty much associative.</p>

<p>Of course, the produced scheme of problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>is described in a general, 
very simplified form. To <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>it in more detail, one can find particular 
legs at every stage; these legs may have some nuances concerning working with 
information. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>problem may <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>into several subproblems and the process of 
<span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>them may be at different stages simultaneously; it is possible to return 
to previous stages for <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of new data or detail elaboration and 
<span>respectively</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>for seeking additional information to that end. But even this 
simplified scheme may be useful for defining the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy of information 
seeking at every stage of problem-solving process.</p>

<p>So, at the first stage it is <span>impossible</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>to formulate precise requirements and 
accordingly queries for necessary information as yet. Thus, the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy at 
this stage is review of as many as possible different data, seeking ideas, 
<span>approaches</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> some common information about this theme in order to form the task 
structure.</p>

<p>At the second stage, when the problem is structured and the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>are 
formulated, the strategy of information seeking by means of <span>exact</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>retrieval 
requests seems to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>to the best advantage. Now the basic purpose of <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>
is the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of useful lights and the definition of the necessary <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of 
data specification.</p>

<p>And at last, at the <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>stage of problem-solving process, it is necessary 
to find additional information sustaining conclusions earlier done. To that end, 
one can use the strategy of retrieval requests as well, but the nature of 
queries will be diverse - less precise, implicit. The queries will cover various 
fields of studies connected with the basic theme associatively, by default.</p>
<p>So, an information <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>system has to provide <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>software <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>for 
the realization of such different retrieval <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>according to the stage of 
problem-solving process. Another way is elemental restriction of system 
adaptability by such stages of problem <span>solving</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> In fact, one can <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>the 
stage of problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and appropriate human information behaviour at this 
stage as the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of context in which this information system can or 
cannot be practicable.</p>

<h2>Some applied <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and their <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>use</h2>

<p>The participants of the conference submitted many papers of applied <span>sort</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> 
Substantially, those are results of surveys of human information behaviour of 
different groups in different <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>There are many different <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of these surveys, for instance, the 
evaluation of existence and accessibility of needful information for <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>
some <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>problems in a certain context or identification of preferential 
information sources and the reasons of these preferences, or appreciation of the 
most frequent and the most successful <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of information seeking in a 
<span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>context. Some of these surveys <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>with <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>information sources, 
for example, the Internet or electronic versions of library catalogues, various 
aspects of using these sources within the <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of certain user groups.</p>

<p>The <span>spectrum</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>surveying</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>samples is also very large. Among them there are 
scholars and seniors, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of different <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and colleges, readers 
of public libraries, physicians, journalists, executives, politicians and common 
citizens, households, and many others. In each case, human information behaviour 
is <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>in a <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>context, i.e., there is a <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span><span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of 
conditions when the information need appears.</p>

<p>The factors which form the foundations of human information behaviour may be 
various; they are defined by demographic, social, professional, and many other 
<span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>as an object of <span>survey</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> There are some 
con0erations of <span>psychological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>aspects of the problem, such as behavioural 
<span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of people of different types in the making of any activity 
including in working with information or impact of emotional conditions on human 
information behaviour, and others.</p>

<p>It seems that results of such surveys may be greatly useful for <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and 
improvement of information <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span><span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span><span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>for certain user groups and 
for the use in certain <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> For example, interesting <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>are reported 
in the papers regarding the studies of the Internet <span>utility</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> <a 
href="#book6">Nicholas and Williams (1998)</a> 
explore the impact of the Internet on information seeking behaviour of 
journalists. According to the authors, journalists should be the most active 
users of this global <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>as professionals which are interested to come at 
the most <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>varied information. However, <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of enthusiasm for such a 
powerful popular full-scale tool, the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>elicited the deep conservatism of 
journalists in the <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of information sources and the ways of information 
reception. Less than twenty percent of metropolitan press journalists use the 
Internet and this percentage is even less for the regional press. The <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>
and methods of using the Internet are extremely limited; in the <span>main</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> they use 
e-mail and electronic versions of periodicals. The researchers analyse in detail 
the attitude of different groups of journalists to using the Internet and elicit 
the reasons of such behaviour.</p>

<p>One of the reasons is the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of time for experiments on the Internet; all 
the more so, these experiments often do not lead to necessary results. As a 
<span>rule</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> journalists are not <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>to choose the subject of their articles; they 
cannot write about anything that was stumbled across on Web-pages and seemed to 
be interesting. Those of them who are independent in the <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of themes use 
the Internet as an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>vastly more often.</p>

<p>Another reason is that about a <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of journalists do not have an access to 
the Internet at all. There are many problems of <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of potential users to 
employ contemporary information retrieval <span>tools</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> As a result, they are out of 
practice of using the Internet and this fact still more redoubles the 
disinclination of journalists to use this information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The results of this <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>seem to be surprising from the viewpoint of 
authors, but <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>or by implication they are confirmed by other explorations 
devoted to using the Internet. For instance, <a 
href="#book8">Savolainen (1998)</a> reports the 
<span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>about non-work use of the Internet in the everyday life of 
the Finns. According to his results, the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>purpose of using the Internet is 
communication with other users, by means of e-mail mostly. Another purpose is 
seeking of orienting information over WWW-services "from the electronic 
newspapers but sometimes merely by surfing from one link to another and hoping 
that something relevant could be found by chance" (<a 
href="#book8">Savolainen (1998)</a>). Task-oriented 
seeking of <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>information is in progress very rarely.</p>

<p>Among the basic reasons of such <span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> more than one <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of the 
Internet users pointed out the random nature of information along with the 
deficient query facilities which gave a headache to their users with 
insufficient <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>skills. Also about one <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of the users mentioned a slow 
<span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>time and connection <span>failure</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> For these reasons, seeking needful 
information by means of the Internet often is too long and without effect. Some 
other papers report about similar <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, these results do not seem unexpected because the 
strategy of information seeking on the Internet corresponds to the first and 
partly the <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>stage of the problem-solving process described earlier. This 
strategy is not <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>for the second stage of this process when <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>
information is necessary. It is quite the thing which should be con0ered when 
one chooses the Internet as an information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>or decides if it is rationally 
to allocate either information on the Web-sites.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>At the end of this review, I would like once more on the morrow of <a 
href="#book5">Mutch (1998)</a> to accent the 
paradoxical role of information in the <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>age. On the one hand, we <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>
about the information <span>revolution</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and development of information society 
emphasizing "an almost magical role in transforming societies, organizations and 
workplaces" (<a href="#book5">Mutch (1998)</a>). On 
the other hand, every <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>individuals and whole organizations try to dispatch 
with the great information stream continuously incoming. People talk about 
information overload and wonder that there are no <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>growth of 
productivity in organizations which invest in information technologies very 
much. Decision makers call for many reports but they have no time to read them; 
an expensive analysis of a problem is undertaken but its <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>are not used; 
one compiles necessary information not before but after decision making, and so 
on. Information may simplify problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and work towards achieving an 
effective decision but for that it has to be <span>exact</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>reliable</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> relevant, <span>actual</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> 
and accessible for the appropriate individual in fit time and in a <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>
form. Only then these lights could correct the existent process.</p>

<p>So, the question comes on: how should we develop information technologies and 
the methods of designing information <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span><span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>in order to ensure really 
effectual information support for the problems of <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>users?</p>

<p>It seems that one of the possible ways is the concise orientation of <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>
<span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>in certain <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> Apparently, there is no point in designing some 
information <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>system in general, a system which carries any information 
fitting for any user.</p>

<p>Before <span>properly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>designing an information system, it is necessary to define 
the basic principles of its construction according to the nature of problems to 
be <span>solved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and the adopted concept of information. Then one has to describe all 
manners of <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>in which <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of either problem may take place, to define 
the stages of this <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>with adequate <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of user’s information 
behaviour, and to assign those stages when the application of the <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>system 
or some its parts will be efficient.</p>

<p>When the system is being elaborated, the designer will be in a position to 
organize a more effective operation of the system with "its" problems, to use 
more profound information; in this instance the system will be useful not only 
for beginners but also for experts in the given department. Be0es, the 
designer will be able to construct a user-friendly interface <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>into account 
technicalities and outstanding <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>users.</p>

<p>Thus, there is a necessity of close interrelation between the designers of 
<span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>and their potential users. The designers exploring the needs of <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>
users and the specialties of their information behaviour could allow this in 
making their <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span> However, now such researches seem to be rather rare, they 
are fragmentary and as a <span>rule</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>are not carried to the practice.</p>

<p>Now even the existent Russian market of information and communication 
technologies is an outfield, there are no <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>particularized <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>
observations or <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>surveys. Even if someone tries shots to study this 
market, these attempts are mainly connected with a contemplation of supply in 
this sector of the economy, but demand is not analysed practically. We have no 
authentic data about the ways and <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>of using the available computing 
machinery. We are roughly aware of the most popular soft products but we do not 
know to what <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>they meet the needs of users in reality.</p>

<p>Designers submit new <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>or improved versions of used products realizing 
their own notions about the most effective and convenient methods of working, 
but very often they do not <span>agree</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>with notions and habits of potential users. As 
a result, there is a <span>conflict</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>between user expectations and the capabilities of 
an <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>system. Explorations of human information behaviour in the process of

<span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:69px 23px 69px 23px;position:relative;">.</span>suited to user needs to the best advantage.</p>

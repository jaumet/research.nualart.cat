<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Every day each of us is forced to solve many different vital problems 
connected with working and training, recreation and education of children, the 
family budget and hobby. For decision making in every concrete situation, it is 
necessary to have as complete and recent information about these things and 
circumstances as possible. The choice of information sources and seeking 
strategies, methods of verification of its reliability and correspondence with 
earlier data, the ways of evaluation of relevance and utility of the findings 
for problem resolution are the factors characterizing human information 
behaviour. The problems of information seeking in context were considered at the 
overpast conference where scientists from many countries of Europe, America, and 
Australia presented around forty reports and a variety of other works at the 
stands. This paper argues some from the numerous ideas and opinions of the 
participants of the conference, which were discussed during their speeches and 
considerations. I have tried to investigate some proposed ideas, models and 
methods with the aim to evaluate their practical usefulness for the design of 
information computer systems.</p>
<h2>Conception of context</h2>
<p>There are many investigations of different information and 
information-seeking problems but the conference was devoted to the problem of 
information seeking in context, i.e., in a concrete situation when the 
information lack problem appears and the process of its acquisition is realized. 
As one can see, the notion of context in itself is not defined exactly now, 
there is a great variety of conceptions and approaches to its description. There 
are also many discussions whether it is necessary to introduce an exact 
definition of context or it is enough to limit ourselves by approximate 
reasoning about its content, whether context develops during some time, and 
whether it is discrete or continuous, what way may be used for defining an edge 
between the notion of context and other concepts such as situation or event, and 
so on.</p>
<p>Context of information seeking may be described by means of many different 
parameters such as the time and place of appearance of information need, the 
time for information seeking, types of participants of the seeking process, for 
example, their demographic, social, professional, educational and behavioural 
characteristics, the purpose of information seeking, the concrete task for which 
this information is looked for, the processes and situations of information 
seeking, and many others. There is a great deal of different context versions 
presented in explorations of the reporters. For example, <a 
href="#book2">Brezillon and Saker (1998)</a> study 
the notion of context in the application for behaviour of the subway operator 
when an incident occurs, <a href="#book3">Gorman 
(1998)</a> researches information seeking of primary care physicians, <a 
href="#book12">van de Wijngaert (1998)</a> considers 
the information behaviour of students when they decide which movies they can go 
to.</p>
<p>So, there are many points of view regarding what context is, but, not going 
into details, it should be necessary to emphasize that the introduction of a 
notion of context allows to pass from study of some ideal process of information 
seeking, which is executed by someone under undetermined conditions, to the 
research of realistic information-seeking behaviour taking into account both 
specific cases and their influence on the information seeking process itself, to 
the choice of search strategies, information sources, methods of evaluation of 
information quality, reliability, and relevance. Using such an approach, it 
becomes possible to organize addressed information support to particular users 
with their concrete needs under their specific conditions.</p>
<h2>Some theoretical concepts and their practical use</h2>
<p>The papers represented at the conference submit both theoretical and applied 
findings of the participants. It is impossible to consider in detail all these 
explorations, so this review is limited to findings which may be used for 
practical design and realization of information computer system.</p>
<p>There are many theoretical problems which are discussed in the papers by <a 
href="#book13">Wilson (1998)</a>, <a 
href="#book4">Kuhlthau (1998)</a>, <a 
href="#book10">Spink (1998)</a>, <a 
href="#book7">Olsson (1998)</a>, <a 
href="#book11">Vakkari (1998)</a>, <a 
href="#book9">Solomon (1998)</a>, <a 
href="#book1">Audunson (1998)</a>, and others. The 
fellows develop general concepts, propose different models of processes 
connected with information seeking and information use, study various approaches 
to information computer system construction.</p>

<p>It seems that the idea of utility of concept, instead of an exact definition 
of notion, is very constructive because concept unlike exact definition suggests 
not only description but the way of exploration and interpretation of a 
phenomenon. Moreover, there is a possibility to choose a concept just conformed 
to the aims of a present task. It may become a comfortable research 
instrumentation for getting interesting results.</p>

<h3>Concept of information</h3>

<p>The notion of information is one of the basic concepts. Researchers study 
several ideas of it and everyone seems to refer to one of the two polar types 
with more or less admissions. The first approach proposes to consider 
information as objective and user as something like an input-output device for 
this information without any impact on its sense, at that the nature of 
information using does not stand on circumstances of this process. Events and 
processes of outness are in the high light. Another approach views information 
as something created by a man on the basis of some received data and his own 
knowledge. In this case, the sense of created information depends on conditions 
of its formation and its author, i.e., on context.</p>

<h3>Approaches to computer system organization</h3>

<p>Of course, the above-described concepts of information are simplified to the 
limit but in fact, taking his choice, an information system designer chooses the 
main principle of his future product construction; this product may be oriented 
either to a system or to a user.</p>

<p>The first approach is described by a neatly defined purpose of construction 
of a computer system, formalized process descriptions, setting tough 
cause-and-effect connections. A user of this future system and his information 
needs are known exactly; a user is not considered as a component of this system. 
The main system function is information processing; at that, generally such a 
system contains specialized information which may be rarely received from other 
sources. If a system was constructed in accordance with these principles, it 
does not depend on the context of its use; in fact, it is initially connected 
with one or a few certain contexts. These contexts are hardwired into such a 
system. So, this system may be used only under certain circumstances which were 
covered previously as far back as at the stage of system design.</
>
<p>This approach is not acceptable for decision of low-structured problems when 
a user has to interpret received data using his own knowledge and experience in 
accordance with a concrete context.</p>

<p>The second approach assumes that the purpose of system creation is formulated 
in general, a future user himself and his information needs are only partly 
known. So, a user is considered as an active component of information system. 
The main system function is information seeking according to user needs; at 
that, information has a common nature and generally speaking may be received 
from other sources. The ways and results of using such a system depend on the 
context of its employment, furthermore, conditions, situations, types of users, 
and their purposes may be very different and can transform during the system 
life-cycle.</p>

<p>Thereby, the mainframe principle of system designing is defined by sorts of 
problems for which a future system is meant. But, doing this choice, a designer 
precisely circumscribes the system usability and therefore the nature of 
information which will be located in the system, and the rules of its 
organization, as well as the algorithms of information retrieval and processing, 
and the forms of result representation.</p>

<p>Speaking about methodologies of information system designing, the 
participants of the conference offered the opinion that existent procedures and 
instrumentation are applicable mostly in the elaboration of system-oriented 
products. They have noted that it is necessary to further the development of 
conceptual approaches and practical methods of construction for user-oriented 
information systems.</p>

<h3>Problem-solving processes</h3>

<p>Among the theoretical explorations delivered at the conference, the research 
of problem-solving processes occupies important place (e.g., <a 
href="#book13">Wilson (1998)</a>, <a 
href="#book4">Kuhlthau (1998),</a> <a 
href="#book11">Vakkari (1998),</a> and others). The 
researchers consider these processes, from problem authentication to decision 
making and its quality estimation. They produce diverse models of these 
processes and also procedures connected with information seeking and using at 
every stage of problem decision.</p>

<p>Generalizing the ideas of the participants of the conference and many 
references to earlier explorations, it seems possible to detail three basic 
stages of problem-solving processes, which essentially differ by the ways of 
working with information.</p>

<p>At the first stage, knowledge about the problem is rather common and 
fragmentary. The solver cannot precisely formulate the problem as yet and, 
respectively, is unable to define what specific information is necessary for 
solving his problem. At this stage, his purpose is to review and to learn as 
much as possible various information for problem perception. For this purpose, 
he uses all sorts of data from many diverse sources, discusses his problem with 
other people; at the same time, he has no plan of his actions and exact criteria 
for the selection of necessary lights as yet. As a result of this activity, at 
the first stage he has to get wise to the content of his problem and to 
construct the methods of its decision.</p>

<p>At the second stage, the solver has a more precise and structured notion of 
his problem. He visualizes the content and possible sources of necessary 
information and executes direct and task-oriented seeking. He is able to define 
relevance of retrieved information by explicit criteria. As a result of this 
stage, he has to propose a solution of his problem.</p>

<p>At the third, final stage of problem-solving process, the solver examines the 
received decision. To that end, he looks for additional information related to 
the theme of study, tries to confirm the regularity of decision. Information 
seeking is pretty much associative.</p>

<p>Of course, the produced scheme of problem solving is described in a general, 
very simplified form. To consider it in more detail, one can find particular 
legs at every stage; these legs may have some nuances concerning working with 
information. A problem may fall into several subproblems and the process of 
solving them may be at different stages simultaneously; it is possible to return 
to previous stages for perception of new data or detail elaboration and 
respectively for seeking additional information to that end. But even this 
simplified scheme may be useful for defining the main strategy of information 
seeking at every stage of problem-solving process.</p>

<p>So, at the first stage it is impossible to formulate precise requirements and 
accordingly queries for necessary information as yet. Thus, the main strategy at 
this stage is review of as many as possible different data, seeking ideas, 
approaches, some common information about this theme in order to form the task 
structure.</p>

<p>At the second stage, when the problem is structured and the purposes are 
formulated, the strategy of information seeking by means of exact retrieval 
requests seems to respond to the best advantage. Now the basic purpose of search 
is the selection of useful lights and the definition of the necessary degree of 
data specification.</p>

<p>And at last, at the third stage of problem-solving process, it is necessary 
to find additional information sustaining conclusions earlier done. To that end, 
one can use the strategy of retrieval requests as well, but the nature of 
queries will be diverse - less precise, implicit. The queries will cover various 
fields of studies connected with the basic theme associatively, by default.</p>
<p>So, an information computer system has to provide suitable software tools for 
the realization of such different retrieval strategies according to the stage of 
problem-solving process. Another way is elemental restriction of system 
adaptability by such stages of problem solving. In fact, one can consider the 
stage of problem solving and appropriate human information behaviour at this 
stage as the characteristics of context in which this information system can or 
cannot be practicable.</p>

<h2>Some applied findings and their practical use</h2>

<p>The participants of the conference submitted many papers of applied sort. 
Substantially, those are results of surveys of human information behaviour of 
different groups in different contexts.</p>

<p>There are many different purposes of these surveys, for instance, the 
evaluation of existence and accessibility of needful information for solving 
some concrete problems in a certain context or identification of preferential 
information sources and the reasons of these preferences, or appreciation of the 
most frequent and the most successful strategies of information seeking in a 
concrete context. Some of these surveys deal with concrete information sources, 
for example, the Internet or electronic versions of library catalogues, various 
aspects of using these sources within the framework of certain user groups.</p>

<p>The spectrum of surveying samples is also very large. Among them there are 
scholars and seniors, students of different universities and colleges, readers 
of public libraries, physicians, journalists, executives, politicians and common 
citizens, households, and many others. In each case, human information behaviour 
is investigated in a concrete context, i.e., there is a detailed description of 
conditions when the information need appears.</p>

<p>The factors which form the foundations of human information behaviour may be 
various; they are defined by demographic, social, professional, and many other 
characteristics of a person as an object of survey. There are some 
considerations of psychological aspects of the problem, such as behavioural 
characteristics of people of different types in the making of any activity 
including in working with information or impact of emotional conditions on human 
information behaviour, and others.</p>

<p>It seems that results of such surveys may be greatly useful for design and 
improvement of information computer systems intended for certain user groups and 
for the use in certain contexts. For example, interesting findings are reported 
in the papers regarding the studies of the Internet utility. <a 
href="#book6">Nicholas and Williams (1998)</a> 
explore the impact of the Internet on information seeking behaviour of 
journalists. According to the authors, journalists should be the most active 
users of this global network as professionals which are interested to come at 
the most actual varied information. However, instead of enthusiasm for such a 
powerful popular full-scale tool, the survey elicited the deep conservatism of 
journalists in the choice of information sources and the ways of information 
reception. Less than twenty percent of metropolitan press journalists use the 
Internet and this percentage is even less for the regional press. The purposes 
and methods of using the Internet are extremely limited; in the main, they use 
e-mail and electronic versions of periodicals. The researchers analyse in detail 
the attitude of different groups of journalists to using the Internet and elicit 
the reasons of such behaviour.</p>

<p>One of the reasons is the lack of time for experiments on the Internet; all 
the more so, these experiments often do not lead to necessary results. As a 
rule, journalists are not free to choose the subject of their articles; they 
cannot write about anything that was stumbled across on Web-pages and seemed to 
be interesting. Those of them who are independent in the choice of themes use 
the Internet as an information source vastly more often.</p>

<p>Another reason is that about a third of journalists do not have an access to 
the Internet at all. There are many problems of education of potential users to 
employ contemporary information retrieval tools. As a result, they are out of 
practice of using the Internet and this fact still more redoubles the 
disinclination of journalists to use this information source.</p>

<p>The results of this survey seem to be surprising from the viewpoint of 
authors, but directly or by implication they are confirmed by other explorations 
devoted to using the Internet. For instance, <a 
href="#book8">Savolainen (1998)</a> reports the 
findings of a survey about non-work use of the Internet in the everyday life of 
the Finns. According to his results, the main purpose of using the Internet is 
communication with other users, by means of e-mail mostly. Another purpose is 
seeking of orienting information over WWW-services "from the electronic 
newspapers but sometimes merely by surfing from one link to another and hoping 
that something relevant could be found by chance" (<a 
href="#book8">Savolainen (1998)</a>). Task-oriented 
seeking of practical information is in progress very rarely.</p>

<p>Among the basic reasons of such situation, more than one third of the 
Internet users pointed out the random nature of information along with the 
deficient query facilities which gave a headache to their users with 
insufficient search skills. Also about one third of the users mentioned a slow 
response time and connection failure. For these reasons, seeking needful 
information by means of the Internet often is too long and without effect. Some 
other papers report about similar findings.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, these results do not seem unexpected because the 
strategy of information seeking on the Internet corresponds to the first and 
partly the third stage of the problem-solving process described earlier. This 
strategy is not intended for the second stage of this process when concrete 
information is necessary. It is quite the thing which should be considered when 
one chooses the Internet as an information source or decides if it is rationally 
to allocate either information on the Web-sites.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>At the end of this review, I would like once more on the morrow of <a 
href="#book5">Mutch (1998)</a> to accent the 
paradoxical role of information in the modern age. On the one hand, we speak 
about the information revolution and development of information society 
emphasizing "an almost magical role in transforming societies, organizations and 
workplaces" (<a href="#book5">Mutch (1998)</a>). On 
the other hand, every day individuals and whole organizations try to dispatch 
with the great information stream continuously incoming. People talk about 
information overload and wonder that there are no essential growth of 
productivity in organizations which invest in information technologies very 
much. Decision makers call for many reports but they have no time to read them; 
an expensive analysis of a problem is undertaken but its findings are not used; 
one compiles necessary information not before but after decision making, and so 
on. Information may simplify problem solving and work towards achieving an 
effective decision but for that it has to be exact, reliable, relevant, actual, 
and accessible for the appropriate individual in fit time and in a suitable 
form. Only then these lights could correct the existent process.</p>

<p>So, the question comes on: how should we develop information technologies and 
the methods of designing information computer systems in order to ensure really 
effectual information support for the problems of future users?</p>

<p>It seems that one of the possible ways is the concise orientation of future 
systems in certain contexts. Apparently, there is no point in designing some 
information computer system in general, a system which carries any information 
fitting for any user.</p>

<p>Before properly designing an information system, it is necessary to define 
the basic principles of its construction according to the nature of problems to 
be solved and the adopted concept of information. Then one has to describe all 
manners of contexts in which solving of either problem may take place, to define 
the stages of this solving with adequate strategies of user’s information 
behaviour, and to assign those stages when the application of the future system 
or some its parts will be efficient.</p>

<p>When the system is being elaborated, the designer will be in a position to 
organize a more effective operation of the system with "its" problems, to use 
more profound information; in this instance the system will be useful not only 
for beginners but also for experts in the given department. Besides, the 
designer will be able to construct a user-friendly interface taking into account 
technicalities and outstanding characteristics of future users.</p>

<p>Thus, there is a necessity of close interrelation between the designers of 
systems and their potential users. The designers exploring the needs of future 
users and the specialties of their information behaviour could allow this in 
making their systems. However, now such researches seem to be rather rare, they 
are fragmentary and as a rule are not carried to the practice.</p>

<p>Now even the existent Russian market of information and communication 
technologies is an outfield, there are no regular particularized statistical 
observations or sample surveys. Even if someone tries shots to study this 
market, these attempts are mainly connected with a contemplation of supply in 
this sector of the economy, but demand is not analysed practically. We have no 
authentic data about the ways and purposes of using the available computing 
machinery. We are roughly aware of the most popular soft products but we do not 
know to what degree they meet the needs of users in reality.</p>

<p>Designers submit new software or improved versions of used products realizing 
their own notions about the most effective and convenient methods of working, 
but very often they do not agree with notions and habits of potential users. As 
a result, there is a conflict between user expectations and the capabilities of 
an offered system. Explorations of human information behaviour in the process of 
problem solving in context and utilization of their findings in designing 
information computer systems could iron out this conflict and assist to create 
systems suited to user needs to the best advantage.</p>

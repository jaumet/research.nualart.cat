<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This paper is aimed at examination of generic human aspects of library
and information work. The topic has gained much attention recently, especially
with respect to concepts of digital libraries, user modelling and new roles
of libraries in digital networked collaborative environment. It is also
connected with knowledge dynamics and new methodological challenges of
information science related to information seeking and use. Traditions
of investigations in user studies, information needs and information retrieval
can be integrated within human and social (cultural) support of information
problems solving.</p>

<p>The framework of our reflections includes questions concerning information
professionals, needs of employers and factors that influence professional
library and information work. We regard human-centered research as holistic
perspective of both individual (cognitive) and social (social constructionist)
approaches to library and information processes. Several details regarding
relationships of users and information professionals are emphasized in
proposed models which depict the position of a man in information processes,
human complexity in information environment, and relationships of people
and information. From strategic viewpoint values and attitudes of library
and information work have been stressed. They are more and more important
for quality of information products, information services and information
systems, as we can see it from our central European perspective (particularly
the Czech and Slovak situation), which requires identification and better
support of human part of changes in library and information system.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Technological development has been so fast in recent decades. It has imposed
many changes on traditional library approaches, methods, solutions. However,
it seems that the answer to the question of human development within these
processes would be rather uncertain. The development of a man compared
to technologies has been rather slow, as we can observe especially in the
situation of Slovak library system practice. Human factors of library and
information work can be determined as a personality of human being in creation,
mediation and use of information including complex communicative human
relationships. As opposed to traditional idea of &quot;neutral&quot; library and
information processes, new ideas take into account natural human, subjective
(cognitive, affective) and cultural and social conditions of these processes.</p>

<p>Traditional patterns of thought in library and information work have
been very closely connected with physical organization of collections,
localization of information sources, or technological support. For quite
a long time of practice, <i>human functionality</i> has not been seen as
the focal point for further development of this work. At present, many
research projects and results appear which consider deeper knowledge of
human being (as a whole) in library and information processes. These processes
include not only rationalistic (logical cognitivistic tradition), but also
other cognitive, affective, behavioural and social components. It is clear
that information seeking gateways (to which libraries are being transformed
at present) should become closer to the ways people think and act when
faced with information problem solving. These ideas have been proved by
research works of Borgman and others (<a href="#ref3">Social aspects...,
1996</a>), <a href="#ref2">Kuhltau</a> (1993), <a href="#ref1">Hjorland</a>
(1997), <a href="#ref3">Wilson</a> (1995, 1999) and others. The original
cognitive approaches (e.g. <a href="#ref1">Allen</a>, 1991, <a href="#ref1">Ingwersen</a>, 1996, etc.) are complemented by more holistic, social and activity approaches which lead to organizational and social issues of information needs, digital libraries and information seeking. The models of support of information-related behaviour are successively transformed from linearity to complexity of human and social considerations, including levels of an individual, communities or groups.</p>

<p>That is why we can state that the so called "postmodern library" brings
new balance between universalism and multiple interpretations combined
with different situations and problem types. As technologies grow, it becomes
possible to manage various viewpoints emerging from concept formation and
interpretation. Ideas of creation, seeking and use of information are methodologically shifted from positivistic (linear) traditions to phenomenological and hermeneutical approaches with the emphasis on social settings and interpretation. In information seeking and use we cannot disembody knowledge from acting,
human and social unity, conceptual re-coordination or circumstantial practices.&nbsp;
<p>We suppose that information problem solving is a cyclic, socially- and
cognitively- based process in which knowledge develops. Several ways of
conceptualization and re-conceptualization arise from constant re-construction
of different interactions. This has an impact on <i>different modalities
of information processing</i> (e.g. face-to-face communication, databases,
location-specific interaction in work environment, social knowledge, etc.).
Other factors of influence on information communication and use include
cultural differences, personal (emotional) attitudes, cognitive evaluations,
social behaviour and environment. Different possible affective states of
human beings can affect patterns of information use (e.g. sensing, recognizing,
understanding, synthesizing, but also interest, uncertainty, anxiety, surprise,
engagement or boredom). In culturally different settings we could find
different ways of expressing knowledge based on different models of practices
(communication, collaboration, learning, working habits).</p>

<p>In our view, new methodological challenges of information science cover
<i>transdisciplinary approach to real-life problems</i> of information seeking and use. It is possible to make use not only of communication studies, psychology, human
factors, human-computer interaction, education or linguistics, but also
social and cultural studies of technology, cultural and linguistic anthropology,
organizational and group communication, semiotics and other disciplines.
Information seeking and use are socially-situated human activities based
on situated cognition, situated activity and behaviour and situated learning.
This idea has created new perspective not only of information science research,
but also of other disciplines concentrated on knowledge and communication,
namely those which make use of advanced technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence,
<a href="#ref3">Sierhuis</a>, 1996). It is also important to stress the shift from descriptive methods to supportive, dynamic methods which can take into account changes in knowledge at any time, at defined problem situations, and for determined user groups.</p> 

<p>Our approach tries to assess knowledge and practice concerned with human
aspects of library and information processes. We would like to formulate
a <i>framework</i> for understanding the role of people in information
processes, including creation, seeking and use of information and knowledge.
From more practical viewpoint we have chosen questions concerning information
professionals, needs of new information institutions (potential employers),
factors that influence the position of a man in information processes,
new partnerships of users and information professionals, and vision of
possible development of library and information work and deeper research
into human issues. Basic aspects of library and information work with respect
to human issues are concentrated on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the position of a human being in information processes,</li>

<li>elements in the environment of information work, especially social changes
in digital age, and technologies and culture with impact on human beings
development,</li>

<li>important relationships of people, technologies and information and knowledge
embodied in interaction when seeking information (human-computer, human-human),
in development of special infomation service, special information system,
or special information product.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information professionals</h2>

<p>In order to understand new roles of library and information workers in
changing digital world we formulate the question: <i>Which are new functions
of information professionals from the human viewpoint of library and information
work?</i></p>

<p>Information professionals have to deliver information, information products
and information services for special problem situations in which users
seek for information. If we admit that in comparison with the past library
and information institutions are more open in every respect, we also have
to try to understand social nature of library and information work which
supports <i>situations of information problem solving</i>. Information
professionals should navigate users to resources, but at the level of special
professional agents who can add value through organization and analysis
of these resources. Information professionals should also help determine
information needs of users. This is a complex diagnostic process based
on human-human interaction, questions-answers, interview, negotiation.
It means complex human communication, of which about 80 percent is non-verbal.
Information science should develop better tools and methods of description
and support of these processes in library and information work.
<p>Information professionals manage and organize information resources.
Traditional concerns of libraries has been explicit knowledge. Its modelling
for purposes of knowledge organization has had long traditions in library
and information science. But <i>situated knowledge, situated cognition
and behaviour</i> with respect to information seeking, creation and use
seem to become new challenges for user and knowledge modelling. Obviously,
human issues raise the question of implicit knowledge including intuition,
know-how, experience, emotions.</p>

<p>Another challenge is represented by the task of professional information
problem solving. Traditional modelling approaches of information retrieval
and knowledge organization usually neglected cultural, behavioural and
contextual factors of information-problem solving. Although we have tools
for modelling general steps in problem-solving, knowledge modelling depends
on types of specific problems. Moreover, the balance between general and
specific in information services, information products and information
systems should also be considered. That is why it is required to pay more
attention to techniques of problem solving in library and information situations.
<p>Information professionals should be partners of users, who provide them
with support, advice and training with respect to information seeeking
patterns. They should provide them rather with <i>supportive activities</i>
than with information as something completed (the only correct answer to
the &quot;query&quot;). We can speak of &quot;information empowerment&quot; of users in terms of human support of information problem solving resulting in active, dynamic
provision of information to users. Again, at present, the extent of generalization
and domain specializations are determined rather individually and intuitively
by information workers. This is also related to user groups and tailoring
services to them, but also to multi-level, multi-lingual and multi-media
characteristics of knowledge organization and information seeking. Other
components of knowledge and information situations include problem goals
(contexts), forms and presentations of content, and ways of the interaction
facilitation.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, information professionals are human beings who try
to <i>transform information to knowledge</i>.Within the interaction with
users they use cognitive, physical, emotional and behavioural components.
That is why we need to discover new methods which are hidden behind the
surface processes of everyday library work. Information processes can be
regarded as human and social processes which should be newly defined in
a new situation. "Tailor-made" new information products for special user
groups require more knowledge and intellectual insight from new information
professionals. This is represented by human nature of information seeking
interaction which should include sensitivity to context, personal and historical
memory and experience, special individual or community viewpoints. New
positions of information professionals are being already transformed into
such professions as information systems and information sources managers,
knowledge officers (managers), information brokers, web-masters, storyborders/multimedia developers, etc.</p>

<h2>Needs of Employers</h2>

<p>Another question rises when we think of new education of information professionals. <i>What are the needs of potential employers with respect to competencies of information workers?</i> (e.g what will library managers and managers of other (new) information institutions expect from their staff in future?). In search for the answer we have identified several possible expectations.</p>

<p>One of the most expected human professional qualities is that of <i>creative
problem solving,</i> which means special information seeking know-how of
information professionals and their abilities to support other people when
faced with this problem. Creativity forms a crucial part of human activity,
especially when connected with information and knowledge. We should pay
more attention to the ways human beings create information products, systems
and services in order to develop systems (agents) that would support the
ability to transform previous solutions to new relationships or to design
new concepts. It can be useful to determine individual and social creativity
in information work.</p>

<p>Next requirements are concentrated on <i>professionality</i> in a broad
sense of this word (acceptance of an important role of information agents
in social life, professional behaviour, professional services). In this
respect it is necessary to re-formulate clearly the role of special information
professionals in social development. Their professionality relies on consultancy,
supportive and intervening principles of specialized "service" professions
(e.g. law, medicine, education). As for personality characteristics of
information professionals, we emphasize motivation, initiative, dependability
and persistence. Again, it would be useful, if our research could tell
more about these features of new information professionals as complex human
beings.</p>

<p>In the last decades, we have been faced with requirements for special
advanced technological background of information professionals. Today,
the complementary needs of <i>social and communicative competence</i> and
emotional intelligence have appeared. We should know more about these characteristics
of information professionals. Better communicative patterns include also
special cultural factors of information communication and use. By term
&quot;cultural&quot; we refer to wider concept of sociological patterns in organizations, groups, nations, determined by attitudes, values, relationships, social norms, historical memory. Social knowledge means especially what people
know about other people, and information science would need to expand this
knowledge into its research related to models of information creation,
organization, seeking and use. As examples we can mention new research
topics of ISIC conferences (<a href="#ref3">Vakkari et al., 1997</a>; <a href="#ref3">Wilson &amp; Allen</a>, 1999) or research in social aspects of digital libraries (<a href="#ref3">Social aspects...</a>, 1996).</p>

<p>New terms like &quot;digital culture&quot; or &quot;virtual environments&quot; imply not only technological advances, but especially their integration into social
life. From this viewpoint information professionals and information science
can help create approachable and enduring knowledge structures for information
infrastructure based on social and collaborative information behaviour.
For example, international research agenda for digital libraries in its
&quot;Brussels report&quot; (<a href="#ref2">An International Research Agenda...</a>,1998) stresses not only &quot;knowledge collaborative networks&quot;, but also support of humans as individuals and organizations in distributed knowledge-based activities. Apart from questions of access to information, information science research should also reflect new modes of creating and sharing
information. Complex situations of information creation and use are human-centered
and as they serve all society, they require high quality and reliability
of knowledge supported by information professionals.</p>

<p>Another concern is related with finding harmony betweeen <i>general
background and practical specialization</i> of new information professionals
as human beings who are able to interact with other people at various levels
of information needs. These levels may depend on cognitive and affective
processes and learning styles, knowledge states (initiation, selection,
presentation), knowledge types (e.g. know-how, experience, intuition, etc.)
multicultural and multilingual issues, work and social activities, cultural
values, patterns of collaboration and innovation. Information professionals
should be aware of these differences (general social competence) in order
to support real-life problems of knowledge creation and use. The ideal
case for global information and communciation profession is combination
of general (strategic, visionary) perspective with practical specialization
including especially abilities of problem structuring, determination of
essential issues and wider contexts.</p>

<h2>Position of Man in library and information processes</h2>

<p>The intersection of factors that influence the position of a man (human
being) in library and information processes is depicted as a general model
on figure 1. The model reminds us of a semantic triangle from semiotics.
But in contrast to original positions of reality (object), signs and concepts,
this model shows that basic library and information work is organized by
institutions and technologies managed by people. Human dimension is represented
by a man who tries to conceptualize, create and use the culture (knowledge
and social know-how) by means of his cognitive and behavioural representations.
Dialogue of technologies and culture is mediated by man and his culture
as set of values and principles based on social patterns of communication
and use of information.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p95fig1.gif" height=167 width=397></div>

<div align="center">Figure 1: Model of factors with impact on a position of man in information work</div>

<p>This intersection of elements (components) can be visible through digital
social transformation which changes workstyles, communicative styles, learning
styles, and also information seeking styles. Group- and project work is
another result of mutual influences of components. Product development
is the result of knowledge management which is based mainly on social network
capable of effective use of knowledge. The effectivity of information seeeking
interaction is connected with institutional (company) culture and professional
culture which has not been deeply explored and designed for library and
information professionals yet (especially in Slovak library system). As
a result the needs for closer integration of information technologies into
library and information processes can be derived and change of rigid organizational
(institutional) structures into human groupwork and better management of
institutions, people and knowledge required.</p>

<p>For new partnerships of users and professionals it is necessary to develop
their "common world" based on human and social activity, often out of traditional
institutional frameworks. Information seeking and use connect individual
and group (social) experience and have to take into account different communicative
and cultural patterns. This has to be addressed especially in multicultural
settings.</p>

<p>In an attempt to generalize these starting ideas, we have developed
another model. It is aimed at explanation of human issues in information
communication and use.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p95fig2.gif" height=378 width=453></div>

<div align="center">Fig. 2 Model of human complexity in information environment</div>

<p>The model of a cyclic human factors in information environment (fig. 2)
shows three basic components of human unity (physical, cognitive and affective,
and social factors). The factors are mutually connected in spiral movement
of information-related behaviour (creating, distributing, seeking and use).
We distinguish objective and subjective sides of information (information-related
activities, knowledge and communication processes) which have substantial
impact on human position in information processes. Empirical level relates
to human experience, cultural, historical, gender and other situational
factors of human information behaviour, while conceptual level is regarded
as special modes of conceptualization of these contexts. The model helps
visualize human issues of library and information processes at generic
level. It should be further elaborated on in research directed towards
philosophical foundations of a man in library and information science.
Basic advantage of this approach is not only its holistic perspective of
human information activities, but also the spiral and self-organizing development
of dynamic knowledge creation and use.</p>

<p>These models can be used for further research into <i>new methodological
approaches</i> to human factors definitions whithin a new paradigm of information
science. It is also necessary to investigate possible collaboration with
other professions which participate in global communication of knowledge
(e.g. publishers, information brokers, media agents, etc.). We propose
to look at them as complex human beings who are set into similar settings
of knowledge communication and who need information workers for specific
reasons.</p>

<h2>New Partnerships</h2>

<p>The question of changes in the partnership of users and information professionals
further fosters positions of human beings in the triangle of technologies,
culture and information institutions. This partnership is determined by
contact of people and information. As a result, special <i>information
services, systems, products, actions and interventions </i>are designed.
The relationship is modelled in Figure 3.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p95fig3.gif" height=167 width=397></div>
<div align="center">Figure 3: Relationships of people and information in library and information work</div>

The question is how to use knowledge efficiently by means of different
kinds of analyses, syntheses and interpretations which are embodied in
activities of information professionals. Human issues of library and information
work then represent <i>complex activities of information professionals
(services, systems, products, actions, interventions</i>). This theoretical
perspective should be incorporated into developmental strategies of new
library and information institutions.</p>

<p>Through categories of services, systems, products, actions and interventions
new partnerships of users and information professionals can emphasize human
relationships. The relationships should be based on professionality. At
present, as a result of technological development, traditional borders
of knowledge institutions (e.g. libraries) disappear and the profession
itself is becoming more important. That is why techniques of social communication
and intercultural issues should be explored, again based on human characteristics
of professional information work. It would be good, if library managers
(in Slovak library system) could understand and manage the transition from
technological development to <i>changes of culture</i> and relationships
of users and workers (experts in information problem solving). These changes
take into account creativity, experience, intensive interaction and direction
towards learning institution. Many supportive (technological) methods can
be used for these purposes, e.g. customer-relationship management, etc.
<p>If we tried to simplify the borders of this partnership, the following
two aspects could be significant: <i>1. Diagnosis of information needs</i>
of users, and <i>2. Users evaluation</i> of systems, products, services,
which is based on human processes of relevance, quality of service, continuity
of information systems and social and human audit of library and information
work.</p>

<p>Diagnosis of information needs can be regarded as complex process in
which information professionals become experts in contacts with users.
They try to understand the problem and the situation of information need
and in interaction with user assess information need evolution and apply
appropriate procedures. The emphasis is laid on communication, context,
preferences and limitations of information use. As for evaluation of services,
systems and products, we regard relevance as cognitive and social category.
(<a href="#ref3">Steinerova, 1996, 1998a</a>). It means focusing on wider social effects of library and information work, prospective evolution of services and processes, or social audit of new information institutions including libraries (e.g.
community identity, social coherence, etc.). Usefulness, efficiency, quality
of information and social interaction need better (new) research methods
of library and information work evaluation. For example, one of the possible
productive solutions is the inclusion of users into design of information
systems, services, products. This has been demonstrated in development
of digital libraries, with knowledge of cultural patterns of user groups
applied to tools or language patterns of retrieval interaction.</p>

<h2>Vision</h2>

<p>The vision of research into human issues of library and information work
should concentrate on special levels of professionality required for special
levels of domains, problems, user groups (needs). In search for new methods
of human issues investigation we distinguish <i>methodological stages of
concept building, finding contexts and product (service, action, system)
development</i>. Thoughts and feelings which lead to understanding of knowledge
and information use result in conceptual structure as part of information-related
activities. Main conceptual factors indicate recognition of information
need, identification of general topic, further elaboration, searching and
presentation of information. Developed conceptual structure should be then
set into special contexts represented by social and environmental factors
(local and cultural viewpoints, knowledge use patterns, interactive and
collaborative patterns). And at the stage of product development the physical
representation of cognitive and affective, social and environmental factors
of information-related behaviour is developed. Special knowledge organization
tools should also accept more social and culture-specific principles, knowledge
dynamics (evolution in time) and possible changes managed by users. Based
on user interfaces we can concentrate on flexible, user-friendly systems
of knowledge organization.</p>

<p>The question of new information seeking patterns could be explored in
design of special (web-)agents that support creative solutions. Human issues
should help find new relationships and partnerships for library and information
work. Regarding information seeking the vision is embodied in research
of retrieval patterns of different individuals, groups, communities. Issues
of prototypical user needs, special group relationships, typical user requirements,
presentation requirements, relevance assessment, personality models, information
seeking strategies, effects, favourite information formats, media, retrieval
tools, communicative preferences, etc. are related to interesting cultural
patterns of user communities. At our Department, several interesting students
works have been completed within this research framework, e.g. gender differences
in information seeking patters, personality types and information seeking
patterns, etc.</p>

<p>Human and social issues of library and information processes should
be investigated at the levels of theory, research and methodology, but
also at more practical levels of education and training of new information
professionals, and practical day-to-day management of institutions including
new partnerships and company culture. The level of national coordination
should provide for social and legal conditions of library work. In our
view, the human dimension forms a strategic part of <i>the development
of new information institutions</i>.</p>

<p>We propose that a new <i>philosophical framework of a man</i> in library
and information processes could be developed, including questions of creativity,
responsibility, technologies and culture in the information age. Special
characteristics of human beings in natural and cultural settings stress
the differences of humans from the rest of biosphere, namely emotional
background, anxiety, and groupwork. If we better knew human issues of library
work, we could design prototypes of user needs. We could try to support
quality of life and cultural development by means of library and information
services based on human processes of learning, cognition, emotions and
information-related behaviour. Other research issues that should be addressed
include different types of perceptions for information seeeking, helpful
assistive technologies supporting information seeking and use, ways of
rise of learning and information behaviour in humans, emotional expression
in information problem solving, and conversational contexts in topic modelling.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion we argue repeatedly that library and information work is
not neutral, but rather human-centered. We propose to get more information
about <i>values and attitudes</i> of human beings who interact in library
and information processes. They are based on social conditions, as well
as on individual cognitive and behavioural features. Information science
in theory and practice simply cannot exclude emotions and empowerment of
people by means of technologies and information. Research topics related
to human issues can enrich library practice and help manage changes of
digital information world.</p>

<p>At a philosophical level information science should reflect transition
from universal approach (unified representation, organization, presentation)
to <i>multiple knowledge levels, contexts, interpretations</i>. It has
to accept principles of different domains, topics, commmunities. Multidimensional,
multifunctional knowledge and interaction confirm natural human complexity
of information-related activites.The modelled relationship between reality
and its interpretation is more flexible and supports variety of interpretations
and changes in cognitive states and social contexts of information seeking.</p>

<p>Our models have shown possible ways of interpretation of human issues
in library and information processes. The outlined framework described
links between theory and practice. Information systems, services and products
are results of complex societal problem of knowledge use in information
society. Research, theory and practice should collaborate closely in order
to better understand human and social issues of library and information
work. The proposed models and framework can be used for further research
with the use of empirical methods.</p>

<p>If library and information professionals were more perceptive to others
knowledge, resulting services and products could support better understanding
among people, groups, nations. And words could become closer to concepts
as results of human and social principles of information use.</p>

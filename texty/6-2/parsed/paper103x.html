<h1>Letter to the Editor</h1>


<h2>Information Management: paper by <span>Holmes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>and Oppenheim on using citation analysis to predict the RAE</h2>

<p>Bibliometrics is a complex (and controversial) field that I usually try to avoid, and I certainly could not claim any familiarity with the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>of background papers cited in the earlier part of this student’s work.  </p>

<p>Given that background, you may think it rash for me to leap into debate about the subject of this paper.  I am, however, concerned that something so naive as this paper should appear in the public <span>domain</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span> and I feel obliged to draw <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>to some of the constraints on its reliability that are not made in the text.</p>

<p>It is based on a <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>of institutions’ staff <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>from their web sites.  As the authors acknowledge, the date the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>was taken can not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>be taken as having provided a current <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>of staff.  More crucially, it is not a requirement that all staff in a department should be submitted.  Tactical decisions will be taken about the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>of individuals as 'active researchers' to be submitted in the RAE in the light of a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>of factors over and above their publication record.  These, for example, might include their 'fit' with the statement of departmental research strategy that is an important part of the overall submission.  Equally significant is the fact that in many institutions in the UK, as elsewhere, LIS is now taught by staff managed in multidisciplinary departments.  The research outputs of many of those staff will not be submitted to the Library and Information Management Unit of Assessment, but may be submitted for con0eration by the Panels concerned with <span>Computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>Science, Communication Studies, etc.</p>

<p>The paper also fails to acknowledge the shortcomings of the Citation Indexes, particularly their somewhat idiosyncratic coverage of journals in the field.  It is fair to note that they do cover the long-established prestigious journals in our field.  However, they also (for historic reasons) cover some publications which would not be recognised as the scholarly journals likely to attract significant research outputs, and a simple count of citations cannot therefore be deemed an appropriate underpinning for a <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>judgement.  Perhaps more significantly, many newer journals which cover emerging fields of information work are not analysed by the Indexes, even though the papers they <span>publish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>may have to meet <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>criteria and refereeing just as <span>rigorous</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>as those of other journals.</p>

<p>Holmes and Oppenheim’s paper <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>citations published since 1994.  Whilst the RAE treats Library and Information Management as a &quot;humanities&quot; subject in which researchers are permitted to submit earlier publications, it seems unlikely that any submission in our field will include material published before 1<sup>st</sup> April  1996, the generally applicable cut off date.  The authors provide no <span>justification</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>for their <span>arbitrary</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>selection of this date.  It does seem self-evident that the longer a paper has been in print, the more <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>it has the potential to be cited by other researchers in the same field, but the RAE is surely more concerned with the current standing of a department and its staff and the prospects for <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>development.  These are more likely to be demonstrated through recent publications and through each department's supporting <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>evaluating recent progress and <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>out <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy.</p>

<p>Two final points.  One is the apparent <span>failure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>to eliminate self-citation by individual researchers and research teams, even though this is a widely recognised form of academic self-justification, and one known to distort citation counts.  The second is the <span>failure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>to give due recognition to the nature of research in our field and its implications for citation counting.   Whilst the authors acknowledge that some sub-disciplines are more likely to be cited than others, they fail to acknowledge that some research (e.g., of an historic nature) is unlikely to ever be cited.  It is also the case that, in many of the LIS sub-disciplines, there is no continuity of interest on the part of practitioners, policy makers and research funders.  Thus, work that is undertaken and published may almost immediately cease to be of interest to other researchers in the field and this may minimise citation of earlier activity.</p>

<p>It may be that the shortcomings of citation analysis that I have mentioned were edited out of the published version of the paper.  As it stands, it demonstrates nothing other than a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>of insight, clarity, and <span>rigour</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>I will not try to deny that, when the results of the Research Assessment appear towards the end of 2001, the ranked order may bear some resemblance to those published in <span>Holmes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>and Oppenheim’s paper.   If they do so, it will be coincidence rather than evidence to support the use of citation analysis as a substitute for contemporary peer review.  </p>

<h2>...and a <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>from <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>Charles Oppenheim</h2>

<p>Johnson rehearses well-known criticisms of citation counting, but misses
the point that despite all those criticisms, citation studies have
consistently <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>to be statistically significantly correlated with other
measures of eminence (see, for example, Seng &amp; Willett, 1995). It is also
known that self-citations do not affect these correlations (see, for
example, Snyder and Bonzi, 1998).  The <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>of 1994 or 1996 start dates are similarly
unlikely to affect the final results we obtained.   Johnson's final
<span>sentences</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:33px 11px 33px 11px;position:relative;">.</span>state that if our results <strong>do</strong> accurately predict, it was a
coincidence;  if they <strong>don't</strong>, it proves his point.  It is up to readers to
judge the validity of this argument for themselves, and to judge how many
times citation studies are shown to be correlated with measures of eminence
before they accept there is some connection between the two.</p>

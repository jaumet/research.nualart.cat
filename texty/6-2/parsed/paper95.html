<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This paper is aimed at examination of generic human aspects of library
and information work. The <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>has gained much <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>recently, especially
with respect to concepts of digital libraries, user modelling and new roles
of libraries in digital networked collaborative <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> It is also
connected with knowledge <span>dynamics</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and new methodological challenges of
information science related to information seeking and use. Traditions
of investigations in user studies, information needs and information retrieval
can be integrated within human and social (cultural) support of information
problems <span>solving</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of our reflections includes questions concerning information
professionals, needs of employers and factors that influence professional
library and information work. We <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>human-centered research as holistic
<span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of both individual (cognitive) and social (social constructionist)
<span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to library and information processes. Several <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>regarding
relationships of users and information professionals are <span>emphasized</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in
proposed models which depict the position of a man in information processes,
human complexity in information <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and relationships of people
and information. From strategic viewpoint <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of library
and information work have been stressed. They are more and more important
for <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information products, information services and information
<span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> as we can see it from our <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>European <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(particularly
the Czech and Slovak situation), which <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>identification and better
support of human part of changes in library and information system.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Technological development has been so fast in recent decades. It has imposed
many changes on traditional library <span>approaches</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> methods, <span>solutions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> However,
it seems that the answer to the question of human development within these
processes would be rather uncertain. The development of a man compared
to technologies has been rather slow, as we can <span>observe</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>especially in the
<span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of Slovak library system practice. <span>Human</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>factors of library and
information work can be determined as a personality of human being in creation,
mediation and use of information including complex communicative human
relationships. As <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to traditional idea of &quot;neutral&quot; library and
information processes, new ideas take into account natural human, subjective
(cognitive, affective) and cultural and social conditions of these processes.</p>

<p>Traditional patterns of thought in library and information work have
been very closely connected with physical organization of collections,
localization of information sources, or technological support. For quite
a long time of practice, <i>human functionality</i> has not been seen as
the focal point for further development of this work. At present, many
research projects and results appear which <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>deeper knowledge of
human being (as a whole) in library and information processes. These processes
include not only rationalistic (logical cognitivistic tradition), but also
other <span>cognitive</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> affective, behavioural and social components. It is clear
that information seeking gateways (to which libraries are being transformed
at present) should become closer to the ways people think and act when
faced with information problem <span>solving</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> These ideas have been <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by
research works of Borgman and others (<a href="#ref3">Social aspects...,
1996</a>), <a href="#ref2">Kuhltau</a> (1993), <a href="#ref1">Hjorland</a>
(1997), <a href="#ref3">Wilson</a> (1995, 1999) and others. The original
<span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(e.g. <a href="#ref1">Allen</a>, 1991, <a href="#ref1">Ingwersen</a>, 1996, etc.) are complemented by more holistic, social and activity <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>which lead to organizational and social issues of information needs, digital libraries and information seeking. The models of support of information-related behaviour are successively transformed from linearity to complexity of human and social con0erations, including levels of an individual, communities or groups.</p>

<p>That is why we can state that the so called "postmodern library" brings
new <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>between universalism and multiple <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>combined
with different situations and problem types. As technologies grow, it becomes
possible to manage various viewpoints emerging from concept formation and
interpretation. <span>Ideas</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of creation, seeking and use of information are methodologically shifted from positivistic (linear) <span>traditions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to phenomenological and hermeneutical <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with the <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on social settings and interpretation. In information seeking and use we cannot disembody knowledge from acting,
human and social unity, conceptual re-coordination or circumstantial <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>&nbsp;
<p>We suppose that information problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is a cyclic, socially- and
cognitively- based process in which knowledge develops. Several ways of
conceptualization and re-conceptualization <span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>from <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>re-construction
of different <span>interactions</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> This has an impact on <i>different modalities
of information processing</i> (e.g. face-to-face communication, databases,
location-specific <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in work <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> social knowledge, etc.).
Other factors of influence on information communication and use include
cultural differences, personal (emotional) <span>attitudes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>evaluations,
social behaviour and <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Different possible affective states of
human beings can affect patterns of information use (e.g. sensing, recognizing,
understanding, synthesizing, but also interest, uncertainty, anxiety, surprise,
engagement or boredom). In culturally different settings we could find
different ways of expressing knowledge based on different models of practices
(communication, collaboration, learning, working habits).</p>

<p>In our view, new methodological challenges of information science cover
<i>transdisciplinary approach to real-life problems</i> of information seeking and use. It is possible to make use not only of communication studies, <span>psychology</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> human
factors, human-computer <span>interaction</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or linguistics, but also
social and cultural studies of technology, cultural and linguistic anthropology,
organizational and group communication, semiotics and other disciplines.
Information seeking and use are socially-situated human activities based
on situated cognition, situated activity and behaviour and situated learning.
This idea has created new <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>not only of information science research,
but also of other disciplines concentrated on knowledge and communication,
<span>namely</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>those which make use of <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>technologies (e.g. artificial intelligence,
<a href="#ref3">Sierhuis</a>, 1996). It is also important to stress the shift from descriptive methods to supportive, dynamic methods which can take into account changes in knowledge at any time, at defined problem situations, and for determined user groups.</p> 

<p>Our approach tries to assess knowledge and practice concerned with human
aspects of library and information processes. We would like to formulate
a <i>framework</i> for understanding the role of people in information
processes, including creation, seeking and use of information and knowledge.
From more <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>viewpoint we have chosen questions concerning information
professionals, needs of new information institutions (potential employers),
factors that influence the position of a man in information processes,
new partnerships of users and information professionals, and vision of
possible development of library and information work and deeper research
into human issues. <span>Basic</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>aspects of library and information work with respect
to human issues are concentrated on:</p>

<ul>
<li>the position of a human being in information processes,</li>

<li>elements in the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information work, especially social changes
in digital age, and technologies and culture with impact on human beings
development,</li>

<li>important relationships of people, technologies and information and knowledge
embodied in <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>when seeking information (human-computer, human-human),
in development of special infomation service, special information system,
or special information product.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Information professionals</h2>

<p>In order to understand new <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of library and information workers in
changing digital world we formulate the question: <i>Which are new functions
of information professionals from the human viewpoint of library and information
work?</i></p>

<p>Information professionals have to deliver information, information products
and information services for special problem situations in which users
seek for information. If we admit that in <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with the past library
and information institutions are more open in every respect, we also have
to try to understand social nature of library and information work which
supports <i>situations of information problem solving</i>. Information
professionals should navigate users to resources, but at the level of special
professional agents who can add value through organization and analysis
of these resources. Information professionals should also help determine
information needs of users. This is a complex diagnostic process based
on human-human <span>interaction</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> questions-answers, interview, negotiation.
It means complex human communication, of which about 80 percent is non-verbal.
Information science should develop better <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and methods of description
and support of these processes in library and information work.
<p>Information professionals manage and organize information resources.
Traditional <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of libraries has been explicit knowledge. Its modelling
for <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge organization has had long <span>traditions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in library
and information science. But <i>situated knowledge, situated cognition
and behaviour</i> with respect to information seeking, creation and use
seem to become new challenges for user and knowledge modelling. Obviously,
human issues raise the question of implicit knowledge including intuition,
know-how, experience, emotions.</p>

<p>Another challenge is <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by the task of professional information
problem <span>solving</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Traditional modelling <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information retrieval
and knowledge organization usually neglected cultural, behavioural and
contextual factors of information-problem <span>solving</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Although we have tools
for modelling general steps in problem-solving, knowledge modelling depends
on types of specific problems. Moreover, the <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>between general and
specific in information services, information products and information
<span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>should also be con0ered. That is why it is required to pay more
<span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to techniques of problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in library and information situations.
<p>Information professionals should be partners of users, who provide them
with support, advice and training with respect to information seeeking
patterns. They should provide them rather with <i>supportive activities</i>
than with information as something completed (the only correct answer to
the &quot;query&quot;). We can <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of &quot;information empowerment&quot; of users in terms of human support of information problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>resulting in active, dynamic
provision of information to users. Again, at present, the extent of generalization
and <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>specializations are determined rather individually and intuitively
by information workers. This is also related to user groups and tailoring
services to them, but also to multi-level, multi-lingual and multi-media
<span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge organization and information seeking. Other
components of knowledge and information situations include problem goals
(contexts), forms and presentations of content, and ways of the interaction
facilitation.</p>

<p>Generally <span>speaking</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> information professionals are human beings who try
to <i>transform information to knowledge</i>.Within the <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with
users they use <span>cognitive</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> physical, emotional and behavioural components.
That is why we need to discover new methods which are hidden behind the
surface processes of everyday library work. Information processes can be
regarded as human and social processes which should be <span>newly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>defined in
a new <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> "Tailor-made" new information products for special user
groups <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>more knowledge and intellectual insight from new information
professionals. This is <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by human nature of information seeking
<span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>which should include sensitivity to context, personal and historical
memory and experience, special individual or <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>viewpoints. New
<span>positions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information professionals are being already transformed into
such professions as information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and information sources managers,
knowledge officers (managers), information brokers, web-masters, storyborders/multimedia developers, etc.</p>

<h2>Needs of Employers</h2>

<p>Another question rises when we think of new <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information professionals. <i>What are the needs of potential employers with respect to competencies of information workers?</i> (e.g what will library managers and managers of other (new) information institutions expect from their staff in future?). In <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for the answer we have identified several possible expectations.</p>

<p>One of the most <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>human professional <span>qualities</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is that of <i>creative
problem <span>solving</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></i> which means special information seeking know-how of
information professionals and their <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to support other people when
faced with this problem. Creativity forms a <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>part of human activity,
especially when connected with information and knowledge. We should pay
more <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the ways human beings create information products, systems
and services in order to develop <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(agents) that would support the
ability to transform previous <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to new relationships or to design
new concepts. It can be useful to determine individual and social creativity
in information work.</p>

<p>Next requirements are concentrated on <i>professionality</i> in a broad
sense of this word (acceptance of an important role of information agents
in social life, professional behaviour, professional services). In this
respect it is necessary to re-formulate clearly the role of special information
professionals in social development. Their professionality relies on consultancy,
supportive and intervening principles of specialized "service" professions
(e.g. law, medicine, education). As for personality <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of
information professionals, we emphasize motivation, initiative, dependability
and persistence. Again, it would be useful, if our research could tell
more about these <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of new information professionals as complex human
beings.</p>

<p>In the last decades, we have been faced with requirements for special
<span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>technological background of information professionals. Today,
the complementary needs of <i>social and communicative competence</i> and
emotional intelligence have <span>appeared</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> We should know more about these characteristics
of information professionals. Better communicative patterns include also
special cultural factors of information communication and use. By term
&quot;cultural&quot; we refer to wider concept of sociological patterns in organizations, groups, nations, determined by <span>attitudes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>values</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> relationships, social norms, historical memory. <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>knowledge means especially what people
know about other people, and information science would need to expand this
knowledge into its research related to models of information creation,
organization, seeking and use. As examples we can mention new research
topics of ISIC conferences (<a href="#ref3">Vakkari et al., 1997</a>; <a href="#ref3">Wilson &amp; Allen</a>, 1999) or research in social aspects of digital libraries (<a href="#ref3">Social aspects...</a>, 1996).</p>

<p>New terms like &quot;digital culture&quot; or &quot;virtual environments&quot; imply not only technological advances, but especially their <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>into social
life. From this viewpoint information professionals and information science
can help create approachable and enduring knowledge structures for information
infrastructure based on social and collaborative information behaviour.
For example, international research agenda for digital libraries in its
&quot;Brussels report&quot; (<a href="#ref2">An International Research Agenda...</a>,1998) stresses not only &quot;knowledge collaborative networks&quot;, but also support of humans as individuals and organizations in distributed knowledge-based activities. Apart from questions of access to information, information science research should also <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>new <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of creating and sharing
information. Complex situations of information creation and use are human-centered
and as they serve all society, they <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>high <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and reliability
of knowledge <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by information professionals.</p>

<p>Another <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is related with <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>harmony betweeen <i>general
background and <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>specialization</i> of new information professionals
as human beings who are able to interact with other people at various levels
of information needs. These levels may <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and affective
processes and learning styles, knowledge states (initiation, <span>selection</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>
presentation), knowledge types (e.g. know-how, experience, intuition, etc.)
multicultural and multilingual issues, work and social activities, cultural
<span>values</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> patterns of collaboration and innovation. Information professionals
should be aware of these differences (general social competence) in order
to support real-life problems of knowledge creation and use. The ideal
case for global information and communciation profession is combination
of general (strategic, visionary) <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>specialization
including especially <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of problem structuring, determination of
<span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>issues and wider <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>Position of Man in library and information processes</h2>

<p>The intersection of factors that influence the position of a man (human
being) in library and information processes is depicted as a general model
on <span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>1. The model reminds us of a <span>semantic</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>triangle</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>from semiotics.
But in contrast to original <span>positions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of reality (object), signs and concepts,
this model shows that basic library and information work is organized by
institutions and technologies managed by people. <span>Human</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>dimension is represented
by a man who tries to conceptualize, create and use the culture (knowledge
and social know-how) by means of his <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and behavioural <span>representations</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>
Dialogue of technologies and culture is mediated by man and his culture
as set of <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and principles based on social patterns of communication
and use of information.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p95fig1.gif" height=167 width=397></div>

<div align="center">Figure 1: Model of factors with impact on a position of man in information work</div>

<p>This intersection of elements (components) can be visible through digital
social transformation which changes workstyles, communicative styles, learning
styles, and also information seeking styles. Group- and project work is
another result of <span>mutual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>influences of components. Product development
is the result of knowledge management which is based mainly on social network
capable of effective use of knowledge. The effectivity of information seeeking
<span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is connected with institutional (company) culture and professional
culture which has not been deeply explored and <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for library and
information professionals yet (especially in Slovak library system). As
a result the needs for closer <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information technologies into
library and information processes can be derived and change of rigid organizational
(institutional) structures into human groupwork and better management of
institutions, people and knowledge required.</p>

<p>For new partnerships of users and professionals it is necessary to develop
their "common world" based on human and social activity, often out of traditional
institutional frameworks. Information seeking and use connect individual
and group (social) experience and have to take into account different communicative
and cultural patterns. This has to be addressed especially in multicultural
settings.</p>

<p>In an attempt to generalize these starting ideas, we have developed
another model. It is aimed at explanation of human issues in information
communication and use.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p95fig2.gif" height=378 width=453></div>

<div align="center">Fig. 2 Model of human complexity in information environment</div>

<p>The model of a cyclic human factors in information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(fig. 2)
shows three basic components of human unity (physical, <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and affective,
and social factors). The factors are mutually connected in spiral movement
of information-related behaviour (creating, distributing, seeking and use).
We <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>objective and subjective 0es of information (information-related
activities, knowledge and communication processes) which have substantial
impact on human position in information processes. Empirical level relates
to human experience, cultural, historical, gender and other situational
factors of human information behaviour, while conceptual level is regarded
as special <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of conceptualization of these <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> The model helps
visualize human issues of library and information processes at generic
level. It should be further elaborated on in research directed towards
philosophical foundations of a man in library and information science.
<span>Basic</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>advantage of this approach is not only its holistic <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of
human information activities, but also the spiral and self-organizing development
of dynamic knowledge creation and use.</p>

<p>These models can be used for further research into <i>new methodological
approaches</i> to human factors <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>whithin a new paradigm of information
science. It is also necessary to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>possible collaboration with
other professions which participate in global communication of knowledge
(e.g. publishers, information brokers, media agents, etc.). We propose
to look at them as complex human beings who are set into similar settings
of knowledge communication and who need information workers for specific
reasons.</p>

<h2>New Partnerships</h2>

<p>The question of changes in the partnership of users and information professionals
further fosters <span>positions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of human beings in the <span>triangle</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of technologies,
culture and information institutions. This partnership is determined by
contact of people and information. As a result, special <i>information
services, <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> products, actions and interventions </i>are <span>designed</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>
The relationship is modelled in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>3.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p95fig3.gif" height=167 width=397></div>
<div align="center">Figure 3: Relationships of people and information in library and information work</div>

The question is how to use knowledge efficiently by means of different
<span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>analyses</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> syntheses and <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>which are embodied in
activities of information professionals. <span>Human</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>issues of library and information
work then <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><i>complex activities of information professionals
(services, <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> products, actions, interventions</i>). This theoretical
<span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>should be incorporated into developmental <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of new
library and information institutions.</p>

<p>Through categories of services, <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> products, actions and interventions
new partnerships of users and information professionals can emphasize human
relationships. The relationships should be based on professionality. At
present, as a result of technological development, traditional borders
of knowledge institutions (e.g. libraries) disappear and the profession
itself is becoming more important. That is why techniques of social communication
and intercultural issues should be explored, again based on human characteristics
of professional information work. It would be good, if library managers
(in Slovak library system) could understand and manage the transition from
technological development to <i>changes of culture</i> and relationships
of users and workers (experts in information problem solving). These changes
take into account creativity, experience, intensive <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and direction
towards learning institution. Many supportive (technological) methods can
be used for these <span>purposes</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> e.g. customer-relationship management, etc.
<p>If we tried to simplify the borders of this partnership, the following
two aspects could be significant: <i>1. Diagnosis of information needs</i>
of users, and <i>2. Users evaluation</i> of <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> products, services,
which is based on human processes of relevance, <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of service, continuity
of information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and social and human audit of library and information
work.</p>

<p>Diagnosis of information needs can be regarded as complex process in
which information professionals become experts in contacts with users.
They try to understand the problem and the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information need
and in <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with user assess information need evolution and apply
appropriate procedures. The <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is laid on communication, context,
preferences and limitations of information use. As for evaluation of services,
<span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and products, we <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>relevance as <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and social category.
(<a href="#ref3">Steinerova, 1996, 1998a</a>). It means focusing on wider social effects of library and information work, prospective evolution of services and processes, or social audit of new information institutions including libraries (e.g.
<span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>identity, social coherence, etc.). Usefulness, efficiency, quality
of information and social <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>need better (new) research methods
of library and information work evaluation. For example, one of the possible
productive <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is the inclusion of users into <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information
<span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> services, products. This has been demonstrated in development
of digital libraries, with knowledge of cultural patterns of user groups
applied to <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or language patterns of retrieval <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>Vision</h2>

<p>The vision of research into human issues of library and information work
should concentrate on special levels of professionality required for special
levels of domains, problems, user groups (needs). In <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for new methods
of human issues <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>we <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><i>methodological stages of
concept building, <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>contexts and product (service, <span>action</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> system)
development</i>. Thoughts and feelings which lead to understanding of knowledge
and information use result in conceptual structure as part of information-related
activities. <span>Main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>conceptual factors <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>recognition of information
need, identification of general <span>topic</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> further elaboration, searching and
<span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information. Developed conceptual structure should be then
set into special <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by social and environmental factors
(local and cultural viewpoints, knowledge use patterns, interactive and
collaborative patterns). And at the stage of product development the physical
<span>representation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and affective, social and environmental factors
of information-related behaviour is developed. Special knowledge organization
<span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>should also accept more social and culture-specific principles, knowledge
<span>dynamics</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(evolution in time) and possible changes managed by users. Based
on user interfaces we can concentrate on flexible, user-friendly systems
of knowledge organization.</p>

<p>The question of new information seeking patterns could be explored in
<span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of special (web-)agents that support creative <span>solutions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>Human</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>issues
should help find new relationships and partnerships for library and information
work. Regarding information seeking the vision is embodied in research
of retrieval patterns of different individuals, groups, communities. Issues
of prototypical user needs, special group relationships, <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>user requirements,
<span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>requirements, relevance assessment, personality models, information
seeking <span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> effects, favourite information formats, media, retrieval
<span>tools</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> communicative preferences, etc. are related to interesting cultural
patterns of user communities. At our Department, several interesting students
works have been completed within this research <span>framework</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> e.g. gender differences
in information seeking patters, personality types and information seeking
patterns, etc.</p>

<p>Human and social issues of library and information processes should
be <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>at the levels of theory, research and methodology, but
also at more <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>levels of <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and training of new information
professionals, and <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>day-to-day management of institutions including
new partnerships and company culture. The level of national coordination
should provide for social and legal conditions of library work. In our
view, the human dimension forms a strategic part of <i>the development
of new information institutions</i>.</p>

<p>We propose that a new <i>philosophical <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of a man</i> in library
and information processes could be developed, including questions of creativity,
responsibility, technologies and culture in the information age. Special
<span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of human beings in natural and cultural settings stress
the differences of humans from the <span>rest</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of biosphere, <span>namely</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>emotional
background, anxiety, and groupwork. If we better knew human issues of library
work, we could <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>prototypes of user needs. We could try to support
<span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of life and cultural development by means of library and information
services based on human processes of learning, cognition, emotions and
information-related behaviour. Other research issues that should be addressed
include different types of <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for information seeeking, helpful
assistive technologies supporting information seeking and use, ways of
<span>rise</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of learning and information behaviour in humans, emotional expression
in information problem <span>solving</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and conversational <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>modelling.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In <span>conclusion</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>we argue repeatedly that library and information work is
not <span>neutral</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> but rather human-centered. We propose to get more information
about <i>values and attitudes</i> of human beings who interact in library
and information processes. They are based on social conditions, as well
as on individual <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and behavioural <span>features</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Information science
in theory and practice simply cannot exclude emotions and empowerment of
people by means of technologies and information. Research topics related
to human issues can enrich library practice and help manage changes of
digital information world.</p>

<p>At a philosophical level information science should <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>transition
from <span>universal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>approach (unified <span>representation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> organization, presentation)
to <i>multiple knowledge levels, <span>contexts</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> interpretations</i>. It has
to accept principles of different domains, topics, commmunities. Multidimensional,
multifunctional knowledge and <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>confirm natural human complexity
of information-related activites.The modelled relationship between reality
and its interpretation is more flexible and supports variety of interpretations
and changes in <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>states and social <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information seeking.</p>

<p>Our models have shown possible ways of interpretation of human issues
in library and information processes. The outlined <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>described
<span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>between theory and practice. Information <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> services and products
are results of complex societal problem of knowledge use in information
society. Research, theory and practice should collaborate closely in order
to better understand human and social issues of library and information
work. The proposed models and <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>can be used for further research
with the use of <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>methods.</p>

<p>If library and information professionals were more perceptive to others
knowledge, resulting services and products could support better understanding
among people, groups, nations. And words could become closer to concepts
as results of human and social principles of information use.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> Many models are available that <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>the information seeking process (<a 
href="#ref1">Wilson</a>, 1999).  The majority of these models <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>that individuals seek 
information and interact with information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to their own, self-generated 
information needs.  While these models do recognize that people go to other people as potential 
resource when in pursuit of information, the models fail to recognize that the default behaviour, when 
the <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>resource doesn't have the answer, doesn't have to be an <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>with information 
providing objects, organizations, or <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>  Instead the <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>seeking information may ask 
someone to find the answer for them.</p>

<p> Information seeking that is externally motivated is called an imposed query and this behaviour is 
graphically <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>in the imposed query model (<a href="#ref2">Gross</a>, 1995).  Although 
this behaviour is <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to many, the model, in recognizing this dimension of information-seeking, 
provides a new way of thinking about whom the user is in information proving organizations and 
environments.  It does this by making a distinction between questions that are self-generated 
(internally motivated by personal context) and those that are imposed (thought up by one <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>then 
given to someone else to resolve).  Based on professional observation, the imposed query reifies the 
experience of information professionals and users who participate in imposed information seeking as 
part of formal and informal relationships with others in a variety of <span>contexts</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> and with varying levels 
of success.  Imposed queries are passed from teachers to <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> from employers to employees, 
may be processed through various types of information gatekeepers, and are also transacted by 
individuals on behalf of friends and family members. Imposed information seeking is a behaviour that 
people engage in and recognize, but which has only recently been isolated for study.  The 
development of the imposed query model was the first step in making this process explicit and initial 
research that isolates and begins to quantify and explore this behaviour in information providing 
environments is now available.</p>

<p>One effect of this model is that it sets up a dichotomy of question type that distinguishes self-
generated questions from imposed ones, understanding them as <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>but related entities.  Because 
this area of study is new, research on the imposed query is <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>descriptive and exploratory in 
nature. However it has already been shown that the imposed query has implications for the 
<span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and evaluation of <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>services (<a href="#ref3">Gross</a>, 1998, 1999a, 
2000a). Still, other questions remain concerning what impact recognition of imposed information 
seeking will have on the development of policies, programs, services, and <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>in information 
providing organizations, as well as on understanding the impacts and benefits of libraries to their 
defined service areas.</p>  

<p>Another effect of the model has been the need to rethink the definition of <i>user</i> and to try 
to identify who the imposers and agents in imposed information seeking are, what circumstances and 
relationships motivate their behaviour, and how user behaviour <span>differs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>based on question type.  Do 
users do the same things and construct meaning the same way when researching self-generated 
questions and imposed ones?</p>

<p>This paper synthesizes <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>from two investigations into imposed information-seeking 
behaviour that <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>on different library environments and populations.  These studies also use 
different methodologies to begin to get a sense of how common imposed information seeking is in 
these environments and to identify who is likely to take on the role of imposer or agent in these 
libraries and user groups.</p>  

<br>
<h2>The Imposed Query: Common behaviour?</h2>

<p>The imposed query model speaks of a process that many find <span>familiar</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>  Examples of imposed 
queries include many formal and informal situations and relationships that people experience in their 
everyday lives.  One example of the imposed query is the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>assignment.  It is easy to 
conceptualize the teacher as imposer and the student as the agent, asked to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to a question he or 
she did not think up, but is responsible for.  This also happens in the working world.  For example, 
administrative assistants, researchers, and law clerks routine collect information for someone else.  In 
the personal realm this behaviour also has many dimensions.  Family members and friends find 
information for each other for a variety of reasons.  Some insight into this behaviour is available in the 
literature of library and information science.  It can be found in the gate keeper studies such as those 
reported by <a href="#ref6">Allen</a> (1979) and <a href="#ref7">Metoyer-Duran</a> (1993), <a href="#ref8">Chu's</a> (1995) work with immigrant <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>as cultural mediators for their non-English <span>speaking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>parents, and <a href="#ref9">Kuhlthau's </a>(1993) work based on the research process of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>is likely the most in-depth study available of how imposed queries are processed by agents responding to assigned research projects.  These studies do not explicitly <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>with the fact that the behaviour they describe surrounds imposed information seeking, but this is not unusual.  The dichotomy of question type has only recently been posed.  It is unfortunate however that many studies have <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>question type in their <span>design</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>  It is possible that our understanding of the importance of question type could have been edified but much research that has been based on questions, but paid little <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to where those questions came from.</p>

<p>Once a <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>has been <span>observed</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> a useful first question to ask is, how <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>does it 
occur?  While the question of frequency is not necessary to make something interesting, it has many 
<span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>advantages in terms of managing the organizations or understanding the <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>within 
which the <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>can be <span>observed</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>  For instance, if a behaviour is not very common it may not 
make sense to spend a great <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of effort or time responding to it from an organizational <span>perspective</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>  
On the other hand, if the clientele of an organization are found to have a high level of a characteristic 
not previously <span>observed</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> it is possible that the policies, procedures, services, and products of the 
organization would do well to take it into account.</p>

<p>The first study to look explicitly at imposed queries took place in elementary <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>library media 
centres serving <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>ages four through 12 (<a href="#ref10">Gross</a>, 1999b, 2000b).  This 
<span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>used both quantitative and <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>methods.  In the quantitative portion a prevalence 
study of circulation transactions was performed in order to determine the level of occurrence of 
imposed queries in the three elementary <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>being studied.  The <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>portion of the study 
involved in-depth interviews with <span>children</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> teachers, and the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>library media specialist at one 
<span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and focused on understanding the life cycle of imposed queries in that <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>  Because 
the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>mission of the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>library media centre is to support curriculum, it seemed a likely 
<span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>in which to see if it is possible to isolate and count imposed queries.</p>

<p>The results of this study were high provocative.  In the three <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>studied the prevalence rate 
for imposed queries fell in the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of 32 to 43 percent of circulation transactions.  Further it appears 
that the number of imposed versus self-generated questions that elementary <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>children check 
materials out of the library for is related to their age.  The youngest <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span><span>checked</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>materials out 
almost entirely in <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to their self-generated needs.  In fact the occurrence rate for self-generated 
queries for these <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>ranged from 92 to 100 percent of their total queries.  As <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>mature, 
more and more of the materials they check out are in service to imposed queries and fewer and fewer 
of them are in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to self-generated needs.  At the upper level self-generated transactions 
accounted for only 50 to 62.5 percent of student circulation transactions.  This trend toward more 
imposed library use as <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>develop makes sense on many levels.  For instance, over this <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
<span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>gradually acquire <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and other skills that make imposed questions more possible.  One 
of the questions brought up by this study however is, what happens to <span>children</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>s library use after the 
sixth grade?  There is some indication from this study that the number of imposed queries continues 
to grow during the middle and high <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>years and that during this time self-generated use of the 
library continues to decline.  <span>Related</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to this question is the impact of increased imposition on child 
and adolescent views of the library and their ability to develop and <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>a love of <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>into 
adulthood?</p>

<p>The second study to look at imposed queries in an information providing <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>was 
incorporated into a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>undertaken in thirteen public libraries in California <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to evaluate 
<span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>service provided to adults (<a href="#ref12">Gross & Saxton</a>, unpublished 
manuscript).  The need to include imposed queries in the evaluation of information programs and 
services has been suggested by <a href="#ref3">Gross</a> (1998), however this <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>may 
be the first to <span>formally</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>incorporate question type into its data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>measure.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>full discussion of 
this <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and the aggregate results are reported by <a href="#ref13">Saxton and Richardson</a> 
(in press).  The analysis of the same data, based on question type is proceeding in stages and is 
<span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to be disseminated in this and other venues.</p>

<p>In all, 1704 adult users transacting questions with <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>librarians were invited to participate 
in this <span>survey</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> Unfortunately, the participation of an additional 677 users could not be solicited as 
minors transacted them and minors were not con0ered eligible to participate in the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>study.  Also 
excluded were 1,139 <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>transactions conducted over the telephone.</p>

<p>The <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>consisted of a written questionnaire that asks users who they are collecting 
information for (self, spouse, child, boss, instructor) or, if these categories are not appropriate, to 
specify the identity of the imposer in an area marked <i>other.</i>  Of those solicited, 1107 users 
completed questionnaires resulting in a <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>rate of 64.9 percent for this <span>survey</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>  Of the users 
who responded, one percent indicated that they did not understand the question, 74 percent said they 
were pursuing their own information needs, and 25 percent, a full quarter of those surveyed, reported 
that they were seeking information for someone else.</p>
<br>
<h2>Who Are Agents and Imposers?</h2>

<p>Each <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>revealed its own set of imposers and agent users, all of whom made sense in 
terms of who these information providing environments are <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to serve.  However, in the 
<span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>library media centre and the public library, looking at user behaviour through the dichotomous 
lens of the imposed query brought new insights about who the user <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>is, what relationships 
bring agent users to the library, and a closer understanding of who the agent users are.</p>
<br>
<h3>Imposed Queries: School Library Media centres and Children</h3>

<p>In the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>library media centre the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>imposer is the classroom teacher.  This makes 
sense, since classroom and homework assignments are traditionally <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to the educative process.  
Less <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>was <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>that parents, <span>children</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> and the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>library media specialist also played 
the part of imposer in the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>environment in ways that affect what happens in both the classroom 
and the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>library media centre.  Parents were imposers working at times through the teacher and 
at times through their <span>children</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> mainly in attempting to ensure that their <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>did or did not have 
certain <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>experiences.  The <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>were shown to impose questions on parents, 
siblings, and classmates and initiate impositions both in and out of <span>school</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>  Child impositions on 
parents were first <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>during the pilot for this study and this behaviour is termed the double 
imposed query (<a href="#ref14">Gross</a>, 1997).  While double imposed queries <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>in other 
<span>contexts</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> one common example of a double imposed query is when the parent transacts for the child 
in service to a <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>assignment.</p>

<p>One very interesting <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>is the discovery that certain <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>actively seek out the role of 
agent and are recognized by classmates as a resource when they need help with either class related or 
personal information needs.  These <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>appear to have expertise in a subject, or a special skill 
that others have not yet developed, or access to some database of knowledge (such as an <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>set 
of baseball cards) that others do not share.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>related <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>indicates that teachers <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to these 
<span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>in a variety of ways in the classroom.  Some teachers praise and reinforce the behaviour; 
others see it as disruptive and discourage it (<a href="#ref11">Gross</a>, 2000b).</p>
<br>
<h3>Imposed Queries: Public Libraries and Adults</h3>

<p>The second study reported here focused on adult users of the public library.  As in the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
library media centre study, the agents and imposers identified in this population and <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
make sense in terms of previous work on public library users.  However, examining these <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
library users in terms of their imposed information seeking behaviour provides a more in depth 
understanding of how public library service extends beyond the people who come in the door to 
many the librarian may never see.</p>

<p>In all, 14 categories of imposers were identified as motivating agent users to visit the adult 
<span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>desk (<a href="#ref12">Gross & Saxton</a>, unpublished manuscript).  These ranged 
from formal relationships like employer, instructor, or client to informal, personal ones like friend, 
spouse, or child.  Agent users also came to the library on behalf of their family, as well as on behalf 
of social groups they belonged to like <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>clubs, church groups, neighborhood associations and 
the like.  Of all the categories identified, four <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to be most significant, together representing 79 
percent of the imposed queries reported in this <span>survey</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>  These were Employer (12 percent), Instructor 
(16 percent), Spouse (16 percent), and Children (35 percent).</p>

<p>The employer category represents agent users that are in the library in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to a work 
assignment.  One of the most provocative things about this category is that it takes what is <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to 
as <i>business use</i> and differentiates between employee use on behalf of employers and other 
<span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of use, such as that of the small <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>owner or personal investor whose <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>library 
use is seen as self-generated.  Employee use of the library, at 12 percent of imposed <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
questions, was smaller than <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>as <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>use is con0ered by some to be one of the most 
significant uses of the public library (<a href="#ref15">Marchant</a>, 1994; <a href="#ref16">Kim 
& Little</a>, 1987).  It is not possible with the data collected for this study to compare self-generated 
and imposed <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>use, but this is an area <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>further study to fully understand what <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
use of the library means and how to best serve these users.  For instance, are libraries servings 
organizations or individuals with their investment in <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>resources?</p>

<p>The instructor category represents agent users in the library to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to a class assignment 
either because they are working toward a <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>or certification or because they are <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>classes as 
part of <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>life-long learning.  Unfortunately, because minors could not be included in this 
study, 677 users at the adult <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>desk could not be <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>surveys.  However, there is some 
indication that the majority of library use by older <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and adolescents are in service to <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
assignments (<a href="#ref10">Gross</a>, 1999b).  It is likely that if these minors could have been 
included in this study, the total percentage of imposed queries and the percent of queries in the 
instructor category of imposition would have been <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and that this impact would be greatest in 
terms of the percent of impositions reported as imposed by instructors.  For instance, if one <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of 
the 677 transactions were imposed by instructors, instructor as an imposer category would have 
accounted for 54 percent of imposed transactions (<a href="#ref12"> Gross & Saxton</a>, 
unpublished manuscript).  Since minors were excluded from this study, this imposer category 
accounted for 16 percent of the reported imposed <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>questions.  Use of adult services by 
minors is an area that has received <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span><span>attention</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> but which is <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>exploring in terms of thinking 
through what adult services in libraries really means.  Looking at who the user really is in this case 
may mean not only recognizing imposition, but also recognizing that the user group in the adult room 
is not homogenous, particularly in terms of its most defining characteristic, age.</p>

<p>Spouse is another important category of imposer, responsible in this study for 16 percent of the 
imposed <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>questions reported.  One of the limitations of this study is that it didn't ask for 
gender data from respondents.  Therefore it <span>isn't</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>known whether the spouses in the library were 
wives or husbands or what mix of the two.  From the time of the public library inquiry (<a 
href="#ref17">Berelson</a>, 1949) to current study of the public library by <a 
href="#ref18">McClure and Bertot</a> (1998), women have been acknowledged as library users.  
In another study it would be interesting to look at both agents in the library for spouses as well as the 
whole self-generated versus imposed use question from the point of view of gender.  What portion of 
the high level of library use attributed to women is <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>in service to other's information needs and 
what portion is self-generated use?  What might these <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>mean in terms of the impacts and 
benefits of libraries on communities?</p>  

<p>The category of library use motivated by child imposers is especially interesting.  Not only was it 
the single largest category of imposed use (35 percent), but it also has implications for additional 
ways that libraries might need to think about service to minors.  In a 1995 Government <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>in the 
United States it was reported that 60 percent of public library users are youth ages 18 and under (<a 
href="#ref19">Heavi0e</a>, 1995).  We know that like women, <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>are heavy public library 
users, but if their impositions on adults were also to be con0ered, the proportion of library use 
attributed to them may <span>prove</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to be under reported.  Further, in scenarios where adults are agent users 
for <span>children</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> the library may be able to serve them better through partnership relationships with local 
<span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and other organizations that share the library's interest in serving <span>children</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>s information 
needs.</p>

<h2>Shared Information Seeking: <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>New Construct</h2>

<p>As stated above, the imposed query model is the result of professional observation and seeks to 
<span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>a process that is <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to many.  Research done on this model is <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>descriptive 
and has been to some extent inductive in nature.  Another result of the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>library media centre 
study is that several variations of the imposed query model were revealed.  These include the double 
imposed query discussed above, a new realization about the nature of teacher questions in the 
classroom context, and observation of <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>who <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>the role of agent without being prompted 
by an imposer.</p>  

<p>In the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>library media centre the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>imposer is the classroom teacher.  This makes 
sense, since classroom and homework assignments are traditionally <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to the educative process, 
but is <span>complicated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>by the fact that the teachers themselves develop questions within a curricular 
<span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>imposed on them by the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and to varying extent the governmental <span>bodies</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>that 
oversee and accredit learning institutions.  In addition, teacher questions are different from other 
imposed queries because teachers do not consume the information they receive in return, if fact they 
tend to know the answer to the question before they ask for it.  Instead of information relevant to their 
own personal context, what they are often looking for is a <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>that they can match to a 
predetermined answer in order to evaluate a student's progress and mastery of the subject under 
study.  While more work is needed to fully understand the nature of teacher queries and teacher 
impositions, a variations of the imposed query model evolved from this understanding that shows 
that their can be multiple imposers influencing and directing imposition.  This <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>is called 
<i>multiple imposers.</i></p> 

<p>A <span>reasonable</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and necessary correlate to this new <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>is the multiple agent imposed query, 
which points out that even as agents may be responding to multiple imposers in their <span>search</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> either 
through a single imposer like a teacher or in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to a group request like gathering data for a 
committee, imposers may also send more than one agent out on the same quest.  One example of this 
is the fact that teacher can give the same question to the whole class.</p>

<p>Perhaps most interesting was the observation in the elementary <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>environment that agents 
can be self-selecting, that is, they may take on the agent role in anticipation of someone else's needs 
or because they enjoy it and that in these instances there is no <i>real</i> imposer generating their 
information seeking behaviour in an overt or explicit sense.  For instance, when a child understands a 
classmate's needs vis--vis an assignment and comes across a good resource for their friend's project 
in the course of their own <span>search</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> they may retrieve it for their friend without being asked.  In an 
early study this behaviour is <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to as the <i>gift query.</i></p>

<p>In such instances the idea of imposition appears less <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to the motivations behind the 
behaviour.  Further, as new variations are found and human information seeking better <span>understood</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> it 
is likely that the imposed query itself will <span>prove</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to be best categorized within a <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>construct that is 
currently being conceptualized as shared information seeking behaviour.</p>
<br>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>While the presence of imposed queries is <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to information providing professionals, very 
little is known about imposed queries in a formal way.  The two investigations reported here are 
significant because they provide a first assessment of the importance of this type of information 
seeking in two different information providing <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and in two different user populations.  These 
studies provide benchmarks for assessing the frequency of this information seeking behaviour in 
information providing organizations and offer an opportunity to view how this behaviour may vary by 
organization and user group.  Without an understanding of the extent to which this behaviour is 
engaged in by users and the <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and interpersonal <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>this behaviour serves, it will not be 
possible to evaluate the relative need or importance of responding to it.  This data has implications for 
organizational policy decisions as well as for the development of information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and services 
and their evaluation.  These investigations provide a point of <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>for similar studies, which 
are needed, in a variety of information providing <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>  These studies are also important for the 
data they yield about who the players in the imposed query life cycle are and how this information-
seeking behaviour is generated.  Efforts to better understand users and user needs in a developmental 
as well as contextual sense must recognize this behavioural dimension in order to build models that are 
holistic and truly representational of <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>users in real <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>  This paper reports key <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
from the first objective studies of imposed information seeking that have been performed so far.  This 
work however, is far from done.  The implications of the imposed query model have been shown to 
affect the <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and evaluation of library programs and services and many other issues remain 
(<a href="#ref3">Gross</a>, 1998, 1999a, 2000a).</p>  

<p>In terms of constructivist <span>approaches</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> the work of <a href="#ref9">Kuhlthau</a> (1993) is 
extremely instructive toward our understanding of one category of imposed query, the research 
assignment, and provides helpful insight into the affective experience of agents in the context of 
schooling.  Other studies like hers are needed for other <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of user and <span>contexts</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> but also with 
users transacting self-generated queries, to more fully understand how these <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of inquiry 
compare.</p>  

<p>Con0eration of the agent user's process also asks for an assessment of how users go about and 
are able to determine relevance and construct meaning for others.  There are only three studies that 
relate to this concept of <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>relevance judgements, but these do not differentiate between self-
generated and imposed questions in their <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#ref20">Barhydt</a>, 1967; <a 
href="#ref21">Janes</a>, 1994; <a href="#ref22">Janes & McKinney</a>, 1992).  Constructs 
such as uncertainty in information seeking, library anxiety, and the challenge to accept both the 
objective and subjective aspects of information are <span>inherent</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>in this <span>search</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>  It will be interesting to 
apply a variety of methodologies in the further descriptive and exploratory work that is waiting to be 
done.  In particular the sense-making methodology developed by <a href="#ref23">Dervin</a> 
(1992) promises to provide interesting insights into how individuals <i>make sense</i> for others in 
a variety of situations.</p>

<p>The imposed query model and the idea of shared information seeking clearly both challenge 
traditional ideas of who the user is and what the common strategy of going to someone else for 
information may really entail.  Beginning from a <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>that includes what people do for each 
other in gathering information promises to elucidate how nformation providing <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and 
organizations can best <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to the needs of agent users and through them to the end-users 
organizations may never <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>see.</p>

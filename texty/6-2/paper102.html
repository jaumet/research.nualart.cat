<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>With the growing emphasis on qualitative research in studies of information
behaviour, any relationship between information behaviour analysis and
the structured approach to information requirements analysis of conventional
systems analysis seems remote. Information behaviour research is concerned
with a deeper understanding of information needs and use, through sense
making as proposed by Dervin (1986) or, for example, features, as proposed
by <a href="#ref2">Ellis</a> (1989).A later integration by <a href="#ref5">Wilson</a> (1999) of the research in the field proposes a problem solving model which considers uncertainty,
though in a slightly different manner from the phenomenological viewpoint
of <a href="#ref2">Kulhthau&quot;s</a> view of uncertainty (1991). Conventional systems analysis
of the hard structured type (for example SSADM, Structured Systems Analysis
and Design Methodology) approaches information requirements analysis with
the aim of providing three views of the data. There is a formal role for
the &quot;user&quot; in SSADM, but this &quot;user involvement&quot; may in fact be limited.
Structured methodologies can be criticised for their failure to involve
the &quot;user&quot;, or fully comprehend their possible role. Inevitably, possibly
the &quot;user&quot; role is often that of a nominal user representative. It might
appear that these apparently very different schools of thought have very
little to learn from each other in the methods that are used to investigate,
analyse and &quot;display&quot; (<a href="#ref3">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</a>) the data collected in
their investigations of user behaviour. New developments in object oriented
analysis methods have similarities to the methods that might be used to
investigate information needs and use in information behaviour studies.
For example, object oriented techniques such as use case analysis and the
development of use case scenarios are similar to the &quot;critical incidents&quot;
and vignettes used in studies of information behaviour (<a href="#ref4">Urquhart &amp;
Hepworth, 1995</a>) (<a href="#ref2">Davies <i>et al</i>, 1997</a>) (<a href="#ref4">Urquhart, 1999</a>). The underlying philosophy is similar though the physical manifestation may be different. For those using the techniques there may be opportunities to learn from the other
school of thought, particularly in the way the analysis of the data can
be displayed - sometimes a difficulty for qualitative researchers when
attempting to explain their analysis convincingly to those who are more
attracted to quick visual overview rather than reading a long textual account.
The quality of qualitative research is often judged on the extent to which
the results are credible. Enough raw data should be provided to give
that evidence but the number of words produced in most qualitative research
means that data should be condensed in a way which makes sense to
those reading the research reports. Charts and diagrams often help to focus
a reader on the main themes which emerge from the data.</p>
<br>
<h2>Information systems and human activity systems</h2>

<p>Object oriented analysis aims to overcome some of the problems of the structured
methodologies (such as SSADM), which can become a rigid straitjacket on
systems development. Efforts to reduce problems and redesign often appear
to have the effect of discouraging the re-investigation of changing user
needs. Soft systems methodology, as developed by <a href="#ref1">Checkland</a> (1981) provides
a general approach to the real, and messy problems of management in many
organisations. <a href="#ref1">Checkland &amp; Holwell</a> (1998) argue that information systems
are more than &quot;data manipulation&quot; systems and that the study of the human
activity systems is vital to an understanding of what an effective information
system might look like.</p>


<p>For systems developers, communication between analyst and the system users
is important and &quot;sharing a language&quot; (<a href="#ref1">Crowe <i>et al.</i>, 1996</a>) more than just a common understanding of the meaning of technical terms within the organisational
domain. There are subtleties of meaning and interpretations of situations
which need to be considered, and there are likely to be many differences
between the &quot;formal rules&quot;, and what people actually do, and between what
they think they are expected to do, and what they would prefer to do. A
study (<a href="#ref2">Davies <i>et al.</i>, 1992</a>) of an academic library illustrated the tensions
that governed communication. Information systems designers who ignore these
disparities do so at their peril.</p>

&nbsp;
<h2>Development of use case scenarios and CRC cards</h2>

<p>Understanding the &quot;stories&quot; that are told within the human activity systems is thus an important part of systems analysis though the extent to which this analysts
formally document this varies. Often the possible &quot;scenarios&quot; are treated
informally rather than formally as more effort is put into formal data
analysis.</p>


<p>One approach to object oriented analysis uses the concepts of roles and interactions. Object Requirements Capture and Analysis, ORCA, (<a href="#ref3">McLean <i>et al.</i>. 1994</a>) is
based on much the same premise as <a href="#ref1">Checkland&quot;s</a> Soft Systems Methodology
(1981) in that analysis should not be based on a statement of initial requirements.
The specifications require an understanding of the Old World, identification
of problems and their causes, before proceeding to proposing justifiable
changes for a New World.</p>

<p><a href="#ref2">Jacobson</a> (1992) developed a more formal approach to scenarios with his Objectory
method for object oriented technology. In this, the &quot;use case&quot; is introduced
as a more formal method for requirements capture and initial planning.
Use cases are usually associated with use case diagrams, and use case scenarios
(and almost inevitably there are some variations in the ways these terms
are interpreted and applied in practice). Fundamentally, they provide a
way of depicting and structuring the interaction of a real world Actor
(person, organisation or external system) with the application being studied.
The Actors are users of the system, and they have goals, or what could
be viewed as &quot;things that must be done&quot;. For a retail system the goals
or use cases concern the &quot;ordering of goods&quot;, &quot;delivery of goods&quot; and &quot;payment
for goods&quot;. The scenarios can be divided into the success scenarios, when
all goes according to plan, and the extensions deal with use cases where
there is a problem. The company may be out of stock, or the customer may
wish to return the goods, or the payment method may be different. Sometimes
it is important to distinguish between system interactions and actual user
goals, and deal with goals first, as suggested by <a href="#ref2">Fowler</a> (1997). For information
service users the goal may be to obtain a document: the system interaction
may concern the inter-library loan procedures. There should be a sequence
of interactions in a compound system interaction (and requesting an inter-library
loan would be a compound interaction) and that sequence would be the basis
of a scenario. For <a href="#ref1">Cockburn</a> (1997) the key feature of a scenario is the
absence of alternatives, and this definition of a scenario appears to relate
closely to the Object Behaviour Analysis &quot;script&quot; as described by <a href="#ref3">Rubin
&amp; Goldberg</a> (1992).</p>

<p>One similar structured approach to user involvement in the process of object-oriented development is the use of CRC cards - Class, Responsibility and Collaboration cards. The technique uses small teams, including users who are &quot;domain
experts&quot;, with the aim of discovering the objects, the classes that the
system comprises, their responsibilities (what they do) and their collaboration,
how they interact with other objects in the system. The technique is aimed
at a better, deeper understanding of the problem situation so that the
information system developed provides a proper solution. Brainstorming
is used to derive provisional classes and behaviour and role-playing is
then used to work through some scenarios, &quot;living the system&quot; according
to <a href="#ref1">Bellin &amp; Simone</a> (1997). The use case methods have been developed
in various other ways, e.g. task scripts, by <a href="#ref2">Graham</a> (1996), textual use
case specifications in natural language as formulated by <a href="#ref3">Rolland &amp;
Ben Achour</a> (1998) and flowgraphs to illustrate control flow semantics,
proposed by <a href="#ref4">Van den Berg &amp; Simon</a> (1999).</p>

<p>What all these ideas on object oriented technology share is an emphasis on the
storyline - seeing the information system in terms of the events and interactions,
and the sequences which tell a meaningful story to the system users. There
is an emphasis also on identifying, and discovering what happens, or should
happen when co-operations are faulty or the use cases are &quot;extended&quot; or
become &quot;abuse cases&quot;.</p>

<br>
<h2>Scripts and stereotypes in information retrieval</h2>

<p>There is an emphasis on object oriented analysis on what <a href="#ref4">Schank &amp; Abelson</a>
(1977) term &quot;scripts&quot;, usual patterns of interaction, and <a href="#ref2">Graham</a> (1996)
has developed the idea of task scripts (for completion of goals) and side
scripts (the stereotypical exceptions). Information retrieval research
has also used the &quot;script&quot; concept in development of the user interface.
In the model of information retrieval design proposed by <a href="#ref1">Belkin <i>et al.</a></i> (1995)scripts are proposed as prototypical interactions. The scripts are construed
as a pattern of moves, or &quot;abstract&quot; dialogues, the purpose of this research
being the production of a better interactive information retrieval system
which will respond appropriately to the stage the user is at in the search.
There are four proposed dimensions to any information seeking strategy:
method of interaction (scanning/searching), goal of interaction (learning/selecting),
mode of retrieval (recognition/specification) and resource considered (information/meta-information). Information seeking strategies are then represented as example scripts, a series of moves required to achieve desired results, and for each strategy there will be a arrangement of goals which organise the set of moves. The problem, of course, is to predict the likely combination of scripts which
will correspond to the switches made by real users from one information
seeking strategy to another.</p>

<h2>Potential and actual information system use</h2>

<p>Much of information systems analysis in organisations is based on the premise
that users will routinely be using the information system in their work,
and that these systems will be &quot;operative&quot; rather than &quot;supportive&quot; as
defined by <a href="#ref3">Malmsjo</a> (1999). Many information systems of interest to library
and information science professionals are &quot;supportive&quot; for users rather
then &quot;operative&quot; and this distinction affects the approaches that have
to be taken to understanding user behaviour. We choose whether or not to
use such &quot;supportive&quot; systems and often we choose whether or not to make
use of the search results obtained, for example. Actual system use may
thus be a small proportion of potential use, and the emphasis in information
behaviour research may be on the patterns of information need and use and
the perceived preferences for certain information sources as opposed to
others. Similarly, we may obtain information, in the form of the output
of a database search, but the actual impact or use in practice may be hard
to assess, as the actual use may be some time in the future.</p>

<h3>Assessing patterns of actual use of information retrieved</h3>

<p>Mapping possible patterns of use is difficult with so many variables affecting
use or potential use. <a href="#ref4">Smithson</a> (1989) examined the contribution of cited
references in students&quot; dissertations of an online search found that a
small (and individually variable) percentage of documents retrieved actually
contributed to the students&quot; dissertations. Some of the problems concerned
the users&quot; inability to find the documents to make a final judgment. <a href="#ref5">Wang</a>
(1996) obtained similar findings in a study of research students and faculty
working on a research project, and suggests that subtle changes in information
needs while working on a project can be mapped by changes in cognitive
structures. Needs and estimations of relevance alter in some way and the
success of a search, whether done by an intermediary or by the user, will
be hard to judge in terms of the contribution made to a list of references.
On the other hand, such objective evidence of effective system use (or
ineffective system use) may be an indicator of the success (or not) of
a training programme, and more meaningful when training is delivered informally,
rather than in formal classroom settings. In that case it may be necessary
to track trends in time and consider the behaviour of a cohort, rather
than the behaviour of individuals within a cohort. One aim of the GIVTS
project (1999) was the evaluation of the effectiveness of Internet training
on evidence-based sources through analysis of the references cited in audit
project reports, which form part of the summative assessment required for
general (family) practitioner trainees in the UK. It proved impossible
to evaluate the training itself, but investigation of the data provided
(titles of projects plus references) did show variations in the emphasis
placed on quality sources of information. There are many factors involved
- the formulation of questions around the clinical problem topic, the emphasis
placed on the need for a systematic review of the literature, accessibility
of databases, development of an appropriate search strategy, skills for
searching, and critical appraisal skills. It is somewhat paradoxical that
systems which are &quot;supportive&quot; may be anything but supportive in practice
for the inexperienced and infrequent user. If the system is supportive,
and all the external conditions are right, then the user can negotiate
an effective route for information seeking, assessment and use. The problem
is that of co-ordination and <a href="#ref4">Spink</a> (2000) emphasises the importance of
the information feedback loop as the basis of human information co-ordinating
behaviour.</p>


<p>Studying feedback implies that studies of information behaviour should include longitudinal studies, such as the &quot;Uncertainty&quot; project (<a href="#ref5">Wilson, 1999</a>).The problem for
longitudinal studies is the time required, and, related to that, the risks
of a high drop-out rate. For example, of 34 video-recorded (with concomitant
field observations) users of OPAC machines in one study, only four of the
subjects for the recorded cases took part in the longitudinal study (<a href="#ref5">Zeitlyn
<i>et al.</i>, 1999</a>).</p>

<br>
<h2>Identifying general patterns of information use</h2>

<p>Identifying the longitudinal development of information seeking behaviour is not, apparently, an easy task, though there have been some studies which track the behaviour of an individual (e.g. a case study by <a href="#ref3">Kuhlthau</a> (1997) of an individual,
starting from secondary school, through university and to work as a securities
analyst). Those developing and funding information services would like
to predict with more accuracy the likely take-up of new services, the barriers
which might have to be overcome to make the service truly supportive and
the opportunities which the users perceive, and learn to perceive, from
their perspective, of the services. From the marketing point of view, information
managers need to assess the likely segments of the market for services.</p>


<p>In view of the difficulty of studying information behaviour over a long period
of time, or what might be termed the whole story, other techniques have
been used to capture brief episodes in the story. This section discusses
some examples of these techniques and their applications, showing some
similarities between the general philosophy of this approach and the use
case scenario ideas of object oriented analysis.</p>

<h3>Critical incident technique</h3>

<p>One technique which may be used to help identify patterns of use or potential
use, is the critical incident technique, which examines a brief, but memorable
information seeking episode. It is therefore useful for examination of
the occasional, or at any rate non-compulsory, use of &quot;supportive&quot; information
systems. Often the incident is explored through an interview, but it is
possible to use a questionnaire format. In the Value project (<a href="#ref4">Urquhart
&amp; Hepworth, 1995</a>) the technique was used to examine the patterns of
information seeking behaviour among groups of doctors. A critical incident
questionnaire was sent once a week for four weeks to the sample (just under
300 medical staff (hospital staff and general practitioners) at 11 sites)
asking, for one incident in the previous week, the purposes for which information
was sought, the sources used, and the degree of success obtained. A similar
technique was used in the EVINCE project (<a href="#ref2">Davies <i>et al.</i>, 1997</a>) to analyse
the patterns of information behaviour among nursing, midwifery and health
visiting staff. The type of questions which could be answered through this
application of the critical incident technique were:</p>

<p>What are the purposes associated with use of colleagues (informal sources of
information)?</p>

<p>Results for medical staff indicated clearly that personal education and updating
was often associated with the need for information on a rare condition
or specific patient problem. Nursing staff appeared to use colleagues as
information sources more than the doctors did, with informal updating linked
in this case more usually to drug therapy queries. The nurses&quot; pattern
was more complex than that of the doctors, reflecting their needs for information
for teaching and mentoring colleagues, patient education and patient care
administration.</p>

<p>The results could thus be analysed to show the patterns of purposes associated with particular sources of information, and, similarly the patterns of sources
associated with particular purposes of information need. Both surveys demonstrated
convincingly that the library use was closely associated with formal and
informal continuing education needs, and research, rather than patient
care problems on their own. For doctors, use of a database such as MEDLINE
was primarily associated with personal research needs, while for nurses
computer based resources such as the CINAHL database was primarily for
formal course work.</p>

<p>The critical incident technique may also be used to profile groups of users,
as was possible with the Value project results. For EVINCE, various groupings
were attempted but there were few significant differences between the groups,
suggesting either that the sample sizes were too small to show an effect
(possible) or that differences in information behaviour among nursing staff
are likely to be at the individual level, not at group level. One could
not therefore predict the likely patterns of information behaviour on the
basis of the assigned task role and place of work (hospital versus community,
for example).</p>

<p>Critical incidents, to some extent, represent information use &quot;stories&quot; which are
complete or near complete. Replication of the techniques in other setting
provides a means of tracking changes in information behaviour of the groups
in general. <a href="#ref1">Bradshaw</a> (1997), for example, adapted the Value and EVINCE
methodology for a study of networked CD-ROM services in one hospital setting,
and extended the methodology to cover social workers, and clinical psychologists.
The findings suggested, for example, that networking did affect the patterns
of use, but that the motivation for use (education (course work for nurses)
and research) remained similar to the Value and EVINCE results.</p>

<h3>Vignettes</h3>

<p>Vignettes are short scenarios presented to subjects, who are then asked to describe their possible actions in those circumstances (or else to describe how
they think others would react in the circumstances). Vignettes have been
used to prompt information users into revealing their information seeking
strategies and choice of information sources (<a href="#ref4">Urquhart, 1999</a>), when direct
questioning might be less productive. <a href="#ref4">Van de Wijngaert</a> (1999) has used
a similar technique, policy capture analysis, to examine media choices
among students. The aim of vignettes used in this way is to present a realistic
situation with which the subjects can identify. Similar aims appear to
have led to the inclusion of a simulated work task situation as one of
the sub-components investigated for an interactive information retrieval
framework by <a href="#ref1">Borlund</a> (2000). The effectiveness of the simulated work task
situation was compared with the simple indicative request and the subjects&quot;
own information needs. Results suggest that the simulated work task situation
produces the same behaviour as the real information needs, although subjects
spent longer on their own needs. In comparing the simulated work task situations
with the indicative requests, a more mixed picture emerges, and this reflects
the observations that some EVINCE vignettes worked better than others,
generally when the subjects had some experience of the situation, or the
topic was of universal interest (<a href="#ref4">Urquhart, 1999</a>), a finding which Borlund
confirmed for their evaluation setting.</p>

<br>
<h3>Vignettes in data analysis and presentation</h3>

<p>Vignettes may also be used to present data analysis, an example in the information
studies field being the narrative &quot;week in the life of&quot; a social services
department in Project INISS (<a href="#ref5">Wilson &amp; Streatfield, 1980</a>).The aim is
to condense the mass of textual information into a meaningful display which
should fulfil several functions, but notably one of allowing the reader
an insight into how the data was analysed in a particular research context.
Vignettes may be used iteratively to help the researcher and subject agree
on a common understanding of the situation (e.g., <a href="#ref2">Greenhalgh <i>et al.</i>, 1998</a>)
and for use cases in systems development that common understanding is the
aim. To develop an information system, however, the interest is not simply
in the &quot;average&quot; or &quot;representative behaviour as might be expressed in
the primary of &quot;happy day&quot; scenario but also in the secondary or alternative
scenarios which deal with the exceptions to the primary scenario. Use case
diagrams have rules for how to display the extensions to the primary use
case, and in some complex conditions it may be better to draw the secondary
scenario separately (see <a href="#ref3">Schneider &amp; Winters, 1998</a>, for example).</p>

<br>
<h2>Applications of scenarios in information behaviour studies</h2>

<p>Formal scenario writing, with the amount of detail required to document the flow
of events, is possibly not a technique that can be used in its entirety
in studies of information behaviour but there are ideas that might be borrowed
and extended in a different way. Documenting and displaying information
seeking pathways in use case type diagrams, showing optional sequences
of events, can help debate these issues. Too often users&quot; information seeking
problems are seen solely in terms of &quot;access to resources&quot; but users&quot; reasons
for seeking new information (or not), and their estimation of the benefits
to be obtained are often far more complex (<a href="#ref4">Urquhart, 1999</a>). Where there
are choices to be made, with a plethora of electronic information sources
available, influencing events and optional sequences can be mapped using
use case diagram ideas, and some of the search strategies used by students
in the JUSTEIS project, First Cycle (2000, Section 6.6)</p>


<p>The figures (Figures 1, 2, 3) illustrate some of the alternative and supplementary
routes chosen by students when their search route demands that. In Figure
1 &quot;update using NASA web site&quot; is a regular search scenario which supplements
the primary scenario of finding course notes on the Web to complete a laboratory
report. The student also uses the library for background reading and books,
to obtain alternative references that may be unique (that other students
would not obtain).</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p102fig1.gif" width="560" height="312" border="0" alt=""></div> 
<div align="center">Figure 1: Finding course notes scenario</div>

<p>Figure 2 illustrates that the process of searching for
recent journal reference, using BIDS ISI was prompted by an IT course given
to the student on BIDS. The student scans, and reviews the results of the
search, and if the selected journals are not available, repeats the search
by scanning using different keywords. Occasionally a search of electronic
journals (full-text) contributes to the review stage.</p> 

<div align="center"><img src="p102fig2.gif" width="564" height="412" border="0" alt=""></div> 
<div align="center">Figure 2: Searching for recent journal references for laboratory write-up</div>

<p>In Figure 3, the failure of a link led the student to revert to emailing personal contacts.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p102fig3.gif" width="511" height="323" border="0" alt=""></div> 
<div align="center">Figure 3: Locating information on a sports team</div>

<p>These Figures represent preliminary work on the data display, and would
be refined in the light of further data analysis and discussion.&nbsp;
Such diagrams can be used to illustrate graphically to those involved in
training in use of electronic information services just what students do
in the process of searching, the ways in which they might revise their
searching strategies (JUSTEIS 2000, Section 6.2.3),&nbsp; and the way in
which advice from academic staff and LIS staff is sought, and acted on,
in the process of the search.&nbsp; Diagrams which show by the &quot;extend&quot;
notation which other 'scripts' are used in the searching process help to
make sense of a vast mass of textual data from interview transcripts.&nbsp;
Such real-life examples provide a valuable feedback into training needs
analysis for library and information services, as well as showing graphically
the actual search strategies that students adopt.&nbsp; It is a more informative
way of representing findings than merely reporting the relative popularity
of various sources.&nbsp; There are some limitations, of course, in that
some students' searching strategies are (apparently) rather muddled and
constraints on their time limit the alternative routes they are willing
to try.&nbsp; Even so, the strategies are worthy of some more formal analysis.</p>

<br>
<h2>CRC cards and focus groups</h2>

<p>Focus groups are now frequently used in LIS research, often with the aim of encouraging participation and stimulating thought to providing unexpected insights
and contributions that might be less easy to obtain in a one-to-one interview
(<a href="#ref2">Goulding, 1997</a>). One assumption of focus groups is that the group effect
will produce more details about information behaviour than might be obtained
from one-to-one interviewing. Similarly, the brainstorming used in the
CRC card technique is used on the basis of the benefits of group problem
solving. It is debatable whether brainstorming does in fact produce more
ideas about a problem than might be obtained from the group working individually
(<a href="#ref1">Buchanan &amp; Huczynski, 1997</a>) but for the purposes of information needs
or information requirements discussions, CRC cards or focus groups may
encourage a shared understanding of the concepts, the events and procedures
that may be involved in an information system or situation. Using a modified
CRC card technique may help, for example, in structuring focus group data
to illustrate the responsibilities and roles of the stakeholders in an
information seeking situation. The CRC technique is aimed, of course, at
system development and therefore make use of documentation that states
system requirements, reports generated, as well as interviews with users.
The main function of CRC technique is to examine the system behaviour and
ensure that the developers do discover and define the right classes required
for software development. The technique makes extensive use of brainstorming
and role play.&nbsp; One aim of the role play is to find the false assumptions,
the bits of the system that do not work together in quite the way some
people might assume. At this stage of the JUSTEIS (2000) work one can only
make speculate what the results of the second cycle will add to the first
cycle findings, but there are indications from the data that there is some
degree of mismatch between expectations of patterns of service use and
actual use of information services.&nbsp; The structured role play that
CRC involves could be adapted to the training situation, so that focus
groups could first investigate the situation generally, and then in a second
round of focus groups analyse exactly what might be happening (or not happening)
through structured role play.</p>

<br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Techniques such as the critical incident technique and vignettes are used at various
stages in the data collection and analysis of information behaviour. Such
techniques share, to a greater or lesser extent, the idea of a &quot;story&quot;
or &quot;sense-making&quot; storyline, which is useful in either eliciting details
about information behaviour from users or displaying data meaningfully.
Asking users for details of their experience in an information seeking
incident, or presenting them with a realistic scenario, seems more likely
to elicit a more valid interpretation of information behaviour than might
be obtained from transaction logging or asking about frequency of information
source use. Similarly, analysing observational data using the vignette
provides a meaningful method of data display which can be discussed with
users and then refined if necessary.</p>


<p>More recent developments in information requirements analysis in software development in object oriented technology are working on parallel lines, though there
is little sign of any cross-fertilisation between ideas and techniques
used by researchers working in information behaviour and and those used
by systems analysts. This paper has shown the similarities in the approaches,
despite the differing provenance (software engineering and information
science). The CRC card techniques, and the use case diagram techniques
used in object oriented analysis may be useful in helping to structure
and present data in information behaviour studies, and may help communication
with the research subjects. Such structured techniques from the field of
systems analysis might help overcome some of the problems of data display
for qualitative research in information seeking and use.</p>

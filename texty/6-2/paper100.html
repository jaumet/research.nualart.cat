<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> Many models are available that represent the information seeking process (<a 
href="#ref1">Wilson</a>, 1999).  The majority of these models assume that individuals seek 
information and interact with information systems in response to their own, self-generated 
information needs.  While these models do recognize that people go to other people as potential 
resource when in pursuit of information, the models fail to recognize that the default behaviour, when 
the person resource doesn't have the answer, doesn't have to be an interaction with information 
providing objects, organizations, or systems.  Instead the person seeking information may ask 
someone to find the answer for them.</p>

<p> Information seeking that is externally motivated is called an imposed query and this behaviour is 
graphically represented in the imposed query model (<a href="#ref2">Gross</a>, 1995).  Although 
this behaviour is familiar to many, the model, in recognizing this dimension of information-seeking, 
provides a new way of thinking about whom the user is in information proving organizations and 
environments.  It does this by making a distinction between questions that are self-generated 
(internally motivated by personal context) and those that are imposed (thought up by one person then 
given to someone else to resolve).  Based on professional observation, the imposed query reifies the 
experience of information professionals and users who participate in imposed information seeking as 
part of formal and informal relationships with others in a variety of contexts, and with varying levels 
of success.  Imposed queries are passed from teachers to students, from employers to employees, 
may be processed through various types of information gatekeepers, and are also transacted by 
individuals on behalf of friends and family members. Imposed information seeking is a behaviour that 
people engage in and recognize, but which has only recently been isolated for study.  The 
development of the imposed query model was the first step in making this process explicit and initial 
research that isolates and begins to quantify and explore this behaviour in information providing 
environments is now available.</p>

<p>One effect of this model is that it sets up a dichotomy of question type that distinguishes self-
generated questions from imposed ones, understanding them as separate but related entities.  Because 
this area of study is new, research on the imposed query is necessarily descriptive and exploratory in 
nature. However it has already been shown that the imposed query has implications for the 
performance and evaluation of reference services (<a href="#ref3">Gross</a>, 1998, 1999a, 
2000a). Still, other questions remain concerning what impact recognition of imposed information 
seeking will have on the development of policies, programs, services, and systems in information 
providing organizations, as well as on understanding the impacts and benefits of libraries to their 
defined service areas.</p>  

<p>Another effect of the model has been the need to rethink the definition of <i>user</i> and to try 
to identify who the imposers and agents in imposed information seeking are, what circumstances and 
relationships motivate their behaviour, and how user behaviour differs based on question type.  Do 
users do the same things and construct meaning the same way when researching self-generated 
questions and imposed ones?</p>

<p>This paper synthesizes findings from two investigations into imposed information-seeking 
behaviour that focus on different library environments and populations.  These studies also use 
different methodologies to begin to get a sense of how common imposed information seeking is in 
these environments and to identify who is likely to take on the role of imposer or agent in these 
libraries and user groups.</p>  

<br>
<h2>The Imposed Query: Common behaviour?</h2>

<p>The imposed query model speaks of a process that many find familiar.  Examples of imposed 
queries include many formal and informal situations and relationships that people experience in their 
everyday lives.  One example of the imposed query is the school assignment.  It is easy to 
conceptualize the teacher as imposer and the student as the agent, asked to respond to a question he or 
she did not think up, but is responsible for.  This also happens in the working world.  For example, 
administrative assistants, researchers, and law clerks routine collect information for someone else.  In 
the personal realm this behaviour also has many dimensions.  Family members and friends find 
information for each other for a variety of reasons.  Some insight into this behaviour is available in the 
literature of library and information science.  It can be found in the gate keeper studies such as those 
reported by <a href="#ref6">Allen</a> (1979) and <a href="#ref7">Metoyer-Duran</a> (1993), <a href="#ref8">Chu's</a> (1995) work with immigrant children as cultural mediators for their non-English speaking parents, and <a href="#ref9">Kuhlthau's </a>(1993) work based on the research process of students is likely the most in-depth study available of how imposed queries are processed by agents responding to assigned research projects.  These studies do not explicitly deal with the fact that the behaviour they describe surrounds imposed information seeking, but this is not unusual.  The dichotomy of question type has only recently been posed.  It is unfortunate however that many studies have failed to consider question type in their design.  It is possible that our understanding of the importance of question type could have been edified but much research that has been based on questions, but paid little attention to where those questions came from.</p>

<p>Once a phenomenon has been observed, a useful first question to ask is, how frequently does it 
occur?  While the question of frequency is not necessary to make something interesting, it has many 
practical advantages in terms of managing the organizations or understanding the contexts within 
which the phenomenon can be observed.  For instance, if a behaviour is not very common it may not 
make sense to spend a great deal of effort or time responding to it from an organizational perspective.  
On the other hand, if the clientele of an organization are found to have a high level of a characteristic 
not previously observed, it is possible that the policies, procedures, services, and products of the 
organization would do well to take it into account.</p>

<p>The first study to look explicitly at imposed queries took place in elementary school library media 
centres serving children ages four through 12 (<a href="#ref10">Gross</a>, 1999b, 2000b).  This 
investigation used both quantitative and qualitative methods.  In the quantitative portion a prevalence 
study of circulation transactions was performed in order to determine the level of occurrence of 
imposed queries in the three elementary schools being studied.  The qualitative portion of the study 
involved in-depth interviews with children, teachers, and the school library media specialist at one 
school and focused on understanding the life cycle of imposed queries in that environment.  Because 
the primary mission of the school library media centre is to support curriculum, it seemed a likely 
environment in which to see if it is possible to isolate and count imposed queries.</p>

<p>The results of this study were high provocative.  In the three schools studied the prevalence rate 
for imposed queries fell in the range of 32 to 43 percent of circulation transactions.  Further it appears 
that the number of imposed versus self-generated questions that elementary school children check 
materials out of the library for is related to their age.  The youngest children checked materials out 
almost entirely in respond to their self-generated needs.  In fact the occurrence rate for self-generated 
queries for these children ranged from 92 to 100 percent of their total queries.  As children mature, 
more and more of the materials they check out are in service to imposed queries and fewer and fewer 
of them are in response to self-generated needs.  At the upper level self-generated transactions 
accounted for only 50 to 62.5 percent of student circulation transactions.  This trend toward more 
imposed library use as children develop makes sense on many levels.  For instance, over this period 
children gradually acquire reading and other skills that make imposed questions more possible.  One 
of the questions brought up by this study however is, what happens to children's library use after the 
sixth grade?  There is some indication from this study that the number of imposed queries continues 
to grow during the middle and high school years and that during this time self-generated use of the 
library continues to decline.  Related to this question is the impact of increased imposition on child 
and adolescent views of the library and their ability to develop and maintain a love of reading into 
adulthood?</p>

<p>The second study to look at imposed queries in an information providing environment was 
incorporated into a survey undertaken in thirteen public libraries in California designed to evaluate 
reference service provided to adults (<a href="#ref12">Gross & Saxton</a>, unpublished 
manuscript).  The need to include imposed queries in the evaluation of information programs and 
services has been suggested by <a href="#ref3">Gross</a> (1998), however this investigation may 
be the first to formally incorporate question type into its data collection measure.  A full discussion of 
this survey and the aggregate results are reported by <a href="#ref13">Saxton and Richardson</a> 
(in press).  The analysis of the same data, based on question type is proceeding in stages and is 
beginning to be disseminated in this and other venues.</p>

<p>In all, 1704 adult users transacting questions with reference librarians were invited to participate 
in this survey. Unfortunately, the participation of an additional 677 users could not be solicited as 
minors transacted them and minors were not considered eligible to participate in the main study.  Also 
excluded were 1,139 reference transactions conducted over the telephone.</p>

<p>The survey consisted of a written questionnaire that asks users who they are collecting 
information for (self, spouse, child, boss, instructor) or, if these categories are not appropriate, to 
specify the identity of the imposer in an area marked <i>other.</i>  Of those solicited, 1107 users 
completed questionnaires resulting in a response rate of 64.9 percent for this survey.  Of the users 
who responded, one percent indicated that they did not understand the question, 74 percent said they 
were pursuing their own information needs, and 25 percent, a full quarter of those surveyed, reported 
that they were seeking information for someone else.</p>
<br>
<h2>Who Are Agents and Imposers?</h2>

<p>Each environment revealed its own set of imposers and agent users, all of whom made sense in 
terms of who these information providing environments are designed to serve.  However, in the 
school library media centre and the public library, looking at user behaviour through the dichotomous 
lens of the imposed query brought new insights about who the user actually is, what relationships 
bring agent users to the library, and a closer understanding of who the agent users are.</p>
<br>
<h3>Imposed Queries: School Library Media centres and Children</h3>

<p>In the school library media centre the primary imposer is the classroom teacher.  This makes 
sense, since classroom and homework assignments are traditionally central to the educative process.  
Less expected was finding that parents, children, and the school library media specialist also played 
the part of imposer in the school environment in ways that affect what happens in both the classroom 
and the school library media centre.  Parents were imposers working at times through the teacher and 
at times through their children, mainly in attempting to ensure that their children did or did not have 
certain kinds of reading experiences.  The children were shown to impose questions on parents, 
siblings, and classmates and initiate impositions both in and out of school.  Child impositions on 
parents were first observed during the pilot for this study and this behaviour is termed the double 
imposed query (<a href="#ref14">Gross</a>, 1997).  While double imposed queries occur in other 
contexts, one common example of a double imposed query is when the parent transacts for the child 
in service to a school assignment.</p>

<p>One very interesting finding is the discovery that certain children actively seek out the role of 
agent and are recognized by classmates as a resource when they need help with either class related or 
personal information needs.  These children appear to have expertise in a subject, or a special skill 
that others have not yet developed, or access to some database of knowledge (such as an extensive set 
of baseball cards) that others do not share.  A related finding indicates that teachers respond to these 
children in a variety of ways in the classroom.  Some teachers praise and reinforce the behaviour; 
others see it as disruptive and discourage it (<a href="#ref11">Gross</a>, 2000b).</p>
<br>
<h3>Imposed Queries: Public Libraries and Adults</h3>

<p>The second study reported here focused on adult users of the public library.  As in the school 
library media centre study, the agents and imposers identified in this population and environment 
make sense in terms of previous work on public library users.  However, examining these typical 
library users in terms of their imposed information seeking behaviour provides a more in depth 
understanding of how public library service extends beyond the people who come in the door to 
many the librarian may never see.</p>

<p>In all, 14 categories of imposers were identified as motivating agent users to visit the adult 
reference desk (<a href="#ref12">Gross & Saxton</a>, unpublished manuscript).  These ranged 
from formal relationships like employer, instructor, or client to informal, personal ones like friend, 
spouse, or child.  Agent users also came to the library on behalf of their family, as well as on behalf 
of social groups they belonged to like reading clubs, church groups, neighborhood associations and 
the like.  Of all the categories identified, four proved to be most significant, together representing 79 
percent of the imposed queries reported in this survey.  These were Employer (12 percent), Instructor 
(16 percent), Spouse (16 percent), and Children (35 percent).</p>

<p>The employer category represents agent users that are in the library in response to a work 
assignment.  One of the most provocative things about this category is that it takes what is referred to 
as <i>business use</i> and differentiates between employee use on behalf of employers and other 
kinds of use, such as that of the small business owner or personal investor whose business library 
use is seen as self-generated.  Employee use of the library, at 12 percent of imposed reference 
questions, was smaller than expected as business use is considered by some to be one of the most 
significant uses of the public library (<a href="#ref15">Marchant</a>, 1994; <a href="#ref16">Kim 
& Little</a>, 1987).  It is not possible with the data collected for this study to compare self-generated 
and imposed business use, but this is an area worth further study to fully understand what business 
use of the library means and how to best serve these users.  For instance, are libraries servings 
organizations or individuals with their investment in business resources?</p>

<p>The instructor category represents agent users in the library to respond to a class assignment 
either because they are working toward a degree or certification or because they are taking classes as 
part of continued life-long learning.  Unfortunately, because minors could not be included in this 
study, 677 users at the adult reference desk could not be offered surveys.  However, there is some 
indication that the majority of library use by older children and adolescents are in service to school 
assignments (<a href="#ref10">Gross</a>, 1999b).  It is likely that if these minors could have been 
included in this study, the total percentage of imposed queries and the percent of queries in the 
instructor category of imposition would have been larger and that this impact would be greatest in 
terms of the percent of impositions reported as imposed by instructors.  For instance, if one third of 
the 677 transactions were imposed by instructors, instructor as an imposer category would have 
accounted for 54 percent of imposed transactions (<a href="#ref12"> Gross & Saxton</a>, 
unpublished manuscript).  Since minors were excluded from this study, this imposer category 
accounted for 16 percent of the reported imposed reference questions.  Use of adult services by 
minors is an area that has received limited attention, but which is worth exploring in terms of thinking 
through what adult services in libraries really means.  Looking at who the user really is in this case 
may mean not only recognizing imposition, but also recognizing that the user group in the adult room 
is not homogenous, particularly in terms of its most defining characteristic, age.</p>

<p>Spouse is another important category of imposer, responsible in this study for 16 percent of the 
imposed reference questions reported.  One of the limitations of this study is that it didn't ask for 
gender data from respondents.  Therefore it isn't known whether the spouses in the library were 
wives or husbands or what mix of the two.  From the time of the public library inquiry (<a 
href="#ref17">Berelson</a>, 1949) to current study of the public library by <a 
href="#ref18">McClure and Bertot</a> (1998), women have been acknowledged as library users.  
In another study it would be interesting to look at both agents in the library for spouses as well as the 
whole self-generated versus imposed use question from the point of view of gender.  What portion of 
the high level of library use attributed to women is actually in service to other's information needs and 
what portion is self-generated use?  What might these findings mean in terms of the impacts and 
benefits of libraries on communities?</p>  

<p>The category of library use motivated by child imposers is especially interesting.  Not only was it 
the single largest category of imposed use (35 percent), but it also has implications for additional 
ways that libraries might need to think about service to minors.  In a 1995 Government survey in the 
United States it was reported that 60 percent of public library users are youth ages 18 and under (<a 
href="#ref19">Heaviside</a>, 1995).  We know that like women, children are heavy public library 
users, but if their impositions on adults were also to be considered, the proportion of library use 
attributed to them may prove to be under reported.  Further, in scenarios where adults are agent users 
for children, the library may be able to serve them better through partnership relationships with local 
schools and other organizations that share the library's interest in serving children's information 
needs.</p> 
<br>
<h2>Shared Information Seeking: A New Construct</h2>

<p>As stated above, the imposed query model is the result of professional observation and seeks to 
represent a process that is familiar to many.  Research done on this model is necessarily descriptive 
and has been to some extent inductive in nature.  Another result of the school library media centre 
study is that several variations of the imposed query model were revealed.  These include the double 
imposed query discussed above, a new realization about the nature of teacher questions in the 
classroom context, and observation of children who assume the role of agent without being prompted 
by an imposer.</p>  

<p>In the school library media centre the primary imposer is the classroom teacher.  This makes 
sense, since classroom and homework assignments are traditionally central to the educative process, 
but is complicated by the fact that the teachers themselves develop questions within a curricular 
framework imposed on them by the school and to varying extent the governmental bodies that 
oversee and accredit learning institutions.  In addition, teacher questions are different from other 
imposed queries because teachers do not consume the information they receive in return, if fact they 
tend to know the answer to the question before they ask for it.  Instead of information relevant to their 
own personal context, what they are often looking for is a response that they can match to a 
predetermined answer in order to evaluate a student's progress and mastery of the subject under 
study.  While more work is needed to fully understand the nature of teacher queries and teacher 
impositions, a variations of the imposed query model evolved from this understanding that shows 
that their can be multiple imposers influencing and directing imposition.  This variation is called 
<i>multiple imposers.</i></p> 

<p>A reasonable and necessary correlate to this new variation is the multiple agent imposed query, 
which points out that even as agents may be responding to multiple imposers in their search, either 
through a single imposer like a teacher or in response to a group request like gathering data for a 
committee, imposers may also send more than one agent out on the same quest.  One example of this 
is the fact that teacher can give the same question to the whole class.</p>

<p>Perhaps most interesting was the observation in the elementary school environment that agents 
can be self-selecting, that is, they may take on the agent role in anticipation of someone else's needs 
or because they enjoy it and that in these instances there is no <i>real</i> imposer generating their 
information seeking behaviour in an overt or explicit sense.  For instance, when a child understands a 
classmate's needs vis-ˆ-vis an assignment and comes across a good resource for their friend's project 
in the course of their own search, they may retrieve it for their friend without being asked.  In an 
early study this behaviour is referred to as the <i>gift query.</i></p>

<p>In such instances the idea of imposition appears less central to the motivations behind the 
behaviour.  Further, as new variations are found and human information seeking better understood, it 
is likely that the imposed query itself will prove to be best categorized within a larger construct that is 
currently being conceptualized as shared information seeking behaviour.</p>
<br>
<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>While the presence of imposed queries is familiar to information providing professionals, very 
little is known about imposed queries in a formal way.  The two investigations reported here are 
significant because they provide a first assessment of the importance of this type of information 
seeking in two different information providing contexts and in two different user populations.  These 
studies provide benchmarks for assessing the frequency of this information seeking behaviour in 
information providing organizations and offer an opportunity to view how this behaviour may vary by 
organization and user group.  Without an understanding of the extent to which this behaviour is 
engaged in by users and the contexts and interpersonal roles this behaviour serves, it will not be 
possible to evaluate the relative need or importance of responding to it.  This data has implications for 
organizational policy decisions as well as for the development of information systems and services 
and their evaluation.  These investigations provide a point of comparison for similar studies, which 
are needed, in a variety of information providing contexts.  These studies are also important for the 
data they yield about who the players in the imposed query life cycle are and how this information-
seeking behaviour is generated.  Efforts to better understand users and user needs in a developmental 
as well as contextual sense must recognize this behavioural dimension in order to build models that are 
holistic and truly representational of actual users in real contexts.  This paper reports key findings 
from the first objective studies of imposed information seeking that have been performed so far.  This 
work however, is far from done.  The implications of the imposed query model have been shown to 
affect the performance and evaluation of library programs and services and many other issues remain 
(<a href="#ref3">Gross</a>, 1998, 1999a, 2000a).</p>  

<p>In terms of constructivist approaches, the work of <a href="#ref9">Kuhlthau</a> (1993) is 
extremely instructive toward our understanding of one category of imposed query, the research 
assignment, and provides helpful insight into the affective experience of agents in the context of 
schooling.  Other studies like hers are needed for other classes of user and contexts, but also with 
users transacting self-generated queries, to more fully understand how these modes of inquiry 
compare.</p>  

<p>Consideration of the agent user's process also asks for an assessment of how users go about and 
are able to determine relevance and construct meaning for others.  There are only three studies that 
relate to this concept of secondary relevance judgements, but these do not differentiate between self-
generated and imposed questions in their design (<a href="#ref20">Barhydt</a>, 1967; <a 
href="#ref21">Janes</a>, 1994; <a href="#ref22">Janes & McKinney</a>, 1992).  Constructs 
such as uncertainty in information seeking, library anxiety, and the challenge to accept both the 
objective and subjective aspects of information are inherent in this search.  It will be interesting to 
apply a variety of methodologies in the further descriptive and exploratory work that is waiting to be 
done.  In particular the sense-making methodology developed by <a href="#ref23">Dervin</a> 
(1992) promises to provide interesting insights into how individuals <i>make sense</i> for others in 
a variety of situations.</p>

<p>The imposed query model and the idea of shared information seeking clearly both challenge 
traditional ideas of who the user is and what the common strategy of going to someone else for 
information may really entail.  Beginning from a perspective that includes what people do for each 
other in gathering information promises to elucidate how nformation providing systems and 
organizations can best respond to the needs of agent users and through them to the end-users 
organizations may never actually see.</p>

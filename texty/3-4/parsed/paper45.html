<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The <span>passion</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>with which disputes are pursued within a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>can sometimes only be matched by the indifference with which they are viewed from <span>out0e</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> For instance, Conan Doyle created a fictional
character whose immersion in criminal milieux rendered him indifferent to the preoccupations of significant <span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>Victorian society:</p>

<blockquote>
'I didn't think there was a soul in England who didn't know Godfrey Staunton, the crack three-quarter, Cambridge, Blackheath, and five Internationals.  Good Lord!  Mr. <span>Holmes</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> where <i>have</i> you lived?'
<br><br>
<span>Holmes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>laughed at the young giant's naive astonishment.
<br><br>
'You live in a different world to me, Mr. Overton, a sweeter and
healthier one.'  (<a href="#cona">Conan Doyle 1980</a>: 389)</blockquote>

<p>At a further extreme, there can be a simple <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of awareness of issues in the enveloping society.  Approaching closer to the <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span><span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of this article, Samuel Johnson commented on the bitterness with which scholarly disputes were pursued despite their <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>implications for communal welfare:</p>

<blockquote>'It is not easy to discover from what <span>cause</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>the acrimony of the scholiast can <span>naturally</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>proceed.  The subjects to be discussed by him are of very small importance; they involve neither property nor liberty; nor favour the interest of sect or party. ...  But ... there is often found ... a <span>spontaneous</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>strain of invective and contempt, more eager and venomous than is vented by the most
furious controvertist in politics against those whom he is hired to defame.' (<a href="#john">Johnson 1984</a>: 448)</blockquote>

<p>Such might be the fate of the Research Assessment Exercise 1996 (RAE), of acute interest within academia but perceived as marginally relevant or simply not known in a broader public context.  </p>

<p>The initial reception of the RAE (from December 1996 to end May
1997) in widely publicly circulated media can be studied to investigate
whether this pattern of intra-communal <span>passion</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and wider public
indifference is revealed and in order to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>on the process
of research assessment.   <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>distinction between types of media
and the communities to which they are primarily addressed can
be made which corresponds to the contrast of intra-communal interest
and extra-communal indifference.  Esoteric media and communities,
located centrally within the milieu of university <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and
research, can be <span>distinguished</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>from exoteric media and communities
in the wider public <span>domain</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>A further significant distinction can be made between dissemination
and diffusion.  Dissemination would refer to the processes of
transmission of the message or <span>expression</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(which can be a physical
product such as a journal or monograph or a <span>sequence</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of electronic
signals) from sender to receiver.  Diffusion would cover the processes
of understanding, including adoption, modification or rejection
by scholarly or other communities.  Dissemination is an essential
precondition for diffusion but should not be identified with it.
 Diffusion could be <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to be more complex and less amenable
to centralised control than dissemination.   Aspects of diffusion,
such as the level of understanding or the extent of rejection
or adoption by receiving communities, may change over time.  Development
over time will therefore also form an important dimension for
this study.</p>

<p>This study briefly <span>discusses</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>the dissemination of the RAE results
in December 1996 and then concentrates on their diffusion over
time through significant exoteric and esoteric media during the
<span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to end May 1997.  The exoteric media covered are principally
the national and regional newspapers.  Esoteric media studied
are primarily those shared across university and research communities
(principally <i>The Times Higher Education Supplement </i>(here
<span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to by its short title, <i>The Times Higher</i>)).
 The educational supplements published with national newspapers
can be regarded as esoteric elements placed within exoteric <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>
 <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>further level of granularity within esoteric media and communities
would be intra-disciplinary communication and some <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>is
given to the journal literature of library and information studies.
 The <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>throughout is dual: both on the processes
of dissemination and diffusion and on the topics discussed.</p>

<p>Data for the study was <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>by relatively informal and more
formal methods.  Relevant media were scanned at critical dates,
although not all newspapers, particularly regional newspapers,
were <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>seen.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>retrospective literature <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>was conducted
through the UKNEWS and SCITECH groups made available by FT Profile
(Note 1.), using a query equivalent to 'research assessment exercise
OR (rae AND research)' across the full text of records.  The files
in these groups, with the notable exception of <i>The Financial
Times</i>, receive <span>limited</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> although increasing, assigned indexing
and no assigned <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>directly descriptive of the RAE was found.
 Comparison of results obtained by relatively informal and more
formal methods suggested that the formal retrieval results were
relatively, although not entirely, comprehensive and that there
was a <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of complementarity between the methods used.  The
<span>principal</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>anticipated fora for discussion were, then, covered
by the processes of retrieval.  Radio and television broadcasting,
for which there are more <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>facilities for retrieval and
more restricted possibilities for obtaining items after their
time of dissemination, were not covered by the formal literature
<span>search</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> although concurrent <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>indicated <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>discussion
of the RAE.</p>

<h2>Empirical study</h2>

<h3>Dissemination</h3>

<p>The initial public dissemination of the RAE shows evidence of careful <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>coordination and control.  The results were made available through the Higher Education Funding Council for England's
(HEFCE) website (<a name="join">Joint Funding Councils of the United Kingdom</a> 1996) from 11am Thursday 19 December 1996.  National newspapers (<i>Guardian</i> <a href="#guar">20 December 1996</a>; <i>Independent</i> <a href="#inde">20 December 1996 </a>; <i>Times</i> <a href="#time">20 December 1996</a>; <i>Times Education</i> <a href="#timed">20 December 1996</a> </a>) reported on these results, without <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>giving a full listing but presenting <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>derived from the results, in their editions of Friday 20 December.  <i>The Times Higher</i> for that <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>gave a full listing together with fuller comparative <span>tables</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and graphics (<i><a href="#timh">Times Higher</i> 20 December 1996a </a>).  Both <i>The Guardian</i> (<a href="#guar">20 December 1996</a>) and <i>The Times Higher</i> (<a href="#timh">20 December 1996b</a>) also refer the reader from their to printed versions to fuller data sets available on their institutional websites.  Electronic media were, then, critical to the initial process of dissemination - the HEFCE website reportedly received 330 hits on Christmas Day (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh">10 January 1997a </a>) - and have remained readily available over time.  Printed media were <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in rapidity of dissemination and in wide
publicly availability over time, although they can be deliberately retrieved.  For processes of diffusion, particularly the development of understanding through public discussion, printed media reassumed
their historically dominant role.</p>

<h3>Diffusion</h3>

<h4>Exoteric media</h4>

<p>Diffusion of information about the RAE into exoteric media has been stratified.  Data and <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>reach such papers as <i>The Guardian</i> (<a href="#guar">20 December 1996</a>), <i>The Times</i> (<a href="#time">20 December 1996 </a>), <i>The Independent</i> (<a href="#inde">20 December 1996</a>), <i>The Observer</i> (<a href="#obse">22 December 1996</a>; <a href="#obse">29 December 1996</a>; <a href="#obse">5 January 1997</a>; <a href="#obse">12 January 1997 </a>) and <i>The Sunday Times</i> (<a href="#sund">30 March 1997</a>), but no trace
was discovered in the <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>circulation daily and Sunday newspapers.  The <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>tend to be deliberately explicatory, carefully contextualising the RAE and giving <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>before grades.
 Regionalism and nationalism emerge as highly significant <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to which the RAE results are assimilated, most explicitly in newspapers from Scotland and Northern Ireland.  The number of articles dealing with the RAE declines sharply over time from December 1996, reflecting the press's known strong preference for currency, although institutional disputes can still <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span><span>attention</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The nature of the diffusion of the RAE into exoteric media can
be read to imply a <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>public awareness of the economic or
social value of learning.  The initial reception <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to present
a set of institutions <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>for prestige and funds, without
giving <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to the use rather than the exchange value of
their research activities.  <i>The Financial Times</i>, despite
its generally <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span><span>concerns</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> concentrates upon the performance
of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span><span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(<i>Financial Times</i> <a href="#fina">23 December 1996</a>).
 When discussion of the RAE does reach <i>The Economist</i>, it
is presented in terms of the financial rewards for research not
the value of learning (<i>Economist</i> <a href="#econ">1 March 1997</a>) and is not
connected with another, more <span>prominent</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> discussion of the economic
benefits of <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(<i>Economist</i> <a href="#econ">29 March 1997a, b</a>).  Yet
the extent of the diffusion of the RAE into public discourse is
reflected in its repeated citation with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to individual institutions
in evaluations <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to inform student <span>choice</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Members of the esoteric <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>have recognised the significance
of exoteric media for communicating with a wider public and for
political persuasion.  The most notable example of this is an
article in <i>The Observer</i> by the vice-chancellors or equivalent
of four <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>research <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>arguing for a clearly differentiated
elite group of <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(<i>Observer</i> <a href="#obse">22 December 1996</a>).
 The institutions (Warwick University, Cambridge University, The
London School of Economics, and Edinburgh University) were subsequently
labeled the 'fratricidal four' (<i>Guardian Higher</i> <a href="#guarh">14 January
1997a
</a>).  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>pattern of dual publication, with communications adapted
to the different demands of exoteric and esoteric media, is also
discernible.  The local <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of some <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>is reflected
in the space made available in regional newspapers for articles
produced by their members.  At a national level, after the period
of initial reception, the <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of the esoteric <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>tend
to emerge in the exoteric media only when they <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>the difficulties
academics share with other citizens, such as continuity of employment
and of their employing institution.</p>

<p>The literature <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of exoteric media also served to remind
that research is a wide, not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>institutionally <span>supported</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>
endeavour not <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to the restricted set of activities acceptable
for the RAE.  The most engaging example of unintended recall (recalled
by the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>statement `rae AND research') came from  <i>Scotland
on Sunday</i> and embodies both nationalism and the diversity
of research: `Did Englishmen eat each other?  In the 150 anniversary
year of Sir John <span>Franklin</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>s death, Tom Pow con0ers why his failed
endeavour overshadowed the greater achievement of the Orcadian
explorer John Rae'. (<i>Scotland on Sunday</i> <a href="#scot">26 January 1997</a>)
 Con0ering the fratricidal four, Voltaire might have concluded
that they still would if they could ('pour encourager les autres')
- and that Edinburgh had <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>this <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>characteristic.</p>

<h4>Esoteric media</h4>

<p>Discussion of the RAE in shared esoteric media contrasts with
its treatment in exoteric fora.  Rather than being deliberately
explicatory, a <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of prior knowledge of the procedures of
the RAE and its immediate institutional context is assumed.  The
discussion can even become cabalistic in the sense that grades
can be cited apart and begin to detach themselves from the activities
to which they refer.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>further influence on academic discourse
is revealed by <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to the RAE in reviews which have no immediate
connection with it: Isaiah <span>Berlin</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>s work was 'emphatically not
an oeuvre for the Research Assessment Exercise' (<i>Times Higher</i>
31 January 1997d).  An absence of <span>false</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>or unintended recall was
noted and this could be explained by the preliminary filtering
effect of the educational context of discussion.</p>

<p>In esoteric <span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of exoteric media, the topics discussed,
such as the organisation of higher <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> tend to be those
present in other esoteric media.  However, the level of analysis
is higher, rarely straying below an institutional level.  The
<span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>presentation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> although not heavily explicatory, is closer
to the enveloping exoteric <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and seems <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to ensure
intelligibility within wider public fora.</p>

<p>A further level of granularity within esoteric media would be
intra-disciplinary forms of  public communication, predominantly
journal literature.  Informal conversations among members of disciplinary
communities may over time be transformed into journal articles.
 There are traces of this in the shared esoteric literature, in
the form of <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to specific <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>publications (<i>Times
Higher</i> <a href="#timh3">28 February 1997e</a>).  The process of peer review (if
this is applied), editorial <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and production and dissemination
of the journal is likely to ensure that such articles appear at
a later date than <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in shared esoteric media.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>strong
<span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>upon the <span>discipline</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of assessment could also be anticipated
and is apparent from those which have <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(for instance,
with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to accountancy (<a href="#whit">Whittington 1997</a>) and library and
information management (<a href="#law">Law 1997</a>)).  This form of esoteric communication
could be <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to be in the early stages of development and
does not form part of the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>focus of this study, although
it can be assimilated to the model of diffusion proposed here.</p>

<h4>Model of diffusion</h4>

<p>A model for the public diffusion of the RAE can, then, be formalised.
 Two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>types of public communication, exoteric and esoteric,
are <span>distinguished</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>  Further <span>distinctions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>can be made within these
categories, critically between trans-disciplinary, or shared,
and intra-disciplinary esoteric literature.  Each form of discourse
has specific <span>characteristics</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>  If a <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>migrates between or
is simultaneously diffused in exoteric and esoteric discourse,
it will tend to be treated in a manner characteristic of the immediately
enveloping <span>medium</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>  This tendency can be ascribed to the participants
in the public conversation holding a model of communication, although
possibly only informally or partially, similar to that formalised
here: authors may adapt their communication to the <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>forum
of publication and editors, in their gatekeeping role, may filter
out inappropriate communications or modify them towards their
publication's <span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of discourse.  With these dimensions in mind,
of an exoteric: esoteric distinction and of change of over time,
the relevant literature can be reviewed.</p>

<h3>Early development</h3>

<p>Some common themes emerge in both esoteric and exoteric media,
particularly in the early stages of diffusion (to c. end January
1997).  Strategic use of data to press institutional or departmental
cases <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in both, although the level of <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>tends to be
finer in esoteric fora, to the department not the institution.
 Even where the nominal issue is to general issues and procedures,
a contribution can be read with <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to the writer's own
situation: for instance, there is a <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>correspondence between
the numbers of staff and the grades obtained by the departments
in the fictional example of two 2 rated departments, one with
'three researchers of international excellence and three who are
young and full of promise' and the other with 'three complete
woodentops and three worthy hacks squeezing out a little dull
work of national <span>quality</span>' <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh">3 January 1997c</a>)
and the contributor's own department.  While seeking political
influence, scholars may betray political naivet&eacute;: some
even seem to have forgotten Denis Healey's First <span>Law</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of Holes
- when you are in one, stop digging (Healey 1996).  There is an
unsurprising absence of departments proclaiming their undeserved
good fortune.  Common to both esoteric and exoteric fora is an
uncritical misuse of citation data (<i>Guardian</i> <a href="#guar">23 December
1996
</a>) and a strong tendency to see issues in institutional not
structural terms.</p>

<p>The early diffusion of the RAE betrays some of the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of a spoken conversation.  Contributions can be brief and in immediate  <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to other <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(for instance, articles and letters published in one edition of a Sunday newspaper may receive responses in the next (<i>Observer</i> <a href="#obse">22 December 1996</a>; <a href="#obse">29 December 1996</a>;
<a href="#obse">5 January 1997</a>; <a href="#obse">12 January 1997</a>)); indiscreet remarks can be made, without the saving impermanence of informal oral utterance; influence is <span>sought</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> and there is an absence of systematic reflection.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>further stage of development is that of anecdote, which appeals
to the exoteric media's known preference for the personalisation of issues, and is also present in esoteric media.  The recurrent implication of these anecdotes is the RAE has had the undesirable effect of encouraging short <span>term</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> functional research and discouraging ambitious and valuable projects.  Another theme is that of talented individuals in research weak institutional <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>  Although less intemperate than the immediate responses, systematic reflection, for instance as a development of the insights yielded by the <span>episodes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>recounted, is still absent - one is reminded of Doonesbury's defense
of the Marlborough man: anecdotally, you'll live to a 100.</p> 

<h3>Subsequent diffusion</h3>

<p>The character of the public discussion of the RAE changes after
the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of initial reception.  It becomes less intemperate
and more con0ered, although no synthesis or comprehensive understanding
of the RAE and its effects was discovered.  The number of contributions
also declines over time, reaching a low level from the end of
May 1997 onwards.  Themes announced in the early stages of diffusion
are adopted and transformed.  Reflection over time <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>predominantly,
although not exclusively, in the esoteric literature and in esoteric
<span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of exoteric media.  The discussion can usefully be con0ered
under a number of themes.</p>

<h4>Spatial dimensions</h4>

<p>A number of issues connected with the geopolitical distribution
of research <span>arise</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>  More technical con0erations to do with interpretation
of critical terms, particularly of 'international excellence',

literature.  Some <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>argue that the process of peer
evaluation has been too inward-looking, without input from real
foreign referees, and that a weak understanding of international
has therefore emerged (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh">10 January 1997b</a>; <a href="#timh2">21
February 1997a

the known Anglo-American bias of the data to be used (the ISI
indexes) is not mentioned as a methodological reservation (<i>Times
Higher</i> <a href="#timh3">21 February 1997b</a>).  Disciplines, with the notable
exception of philosophy, are not usually conceived as being significantly
geospatially distributed.  Reflection on these <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and
<span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>on the process of research assessment would suggest:
that 'international <i>excellence</i>' has been generally understood
as international <i>participation</i> in scholarly communities,
particularly through journals and conferences; that international
has often been received as Anglo-American or, with a broader <span>reference</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>
as <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>language communication; and that contrasts in understandings

The importance of particular <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to a <span>region</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>is revealed
by the reporting of their research standing in locally produced

for Northern Ireland, are reported, although the <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of
imposed uniformity and partly nominal regional or national autonomy
is not fully remarked or related to the broader political context
(<i>Guardian Higher</i> <a href="#guarh">25 March 1997</a>).  Absent from both exoteric
and esoteric media is any <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to the pleasures of location

<h4>Organisation of universities</h4>

Anecdote can cross the exoteric:esoteric boundary and topics connected with academics as employees emerge in both types of literature.</p>

<p>The article in  <i>The Observer</i> received as arguing for a clearly <span>distinguished</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>elite group of <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>can be regarded as a members of the esoteric <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>deliberately addressing the exoteric <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>  It generates a debate which migrates to the esoteric literature and which gains the closer and deeper <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>characteristic of those fora.  As the discussion develops, its specific origins are disguised or forgotten, a process characteristic of the transmission of ideas (<a href="#kuhn">Kuhn 1970</a>) (con0er also the citation of <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>sources), and it becomes transformed into a recognisable theme of an elite group of <span>universities</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Different aspects to the discussion of an elite group can be <span>distinguished</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> its existence, its possible existence, and the desirability of its existence, although these are not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>clearly differentiated

Arguments against differentiation originate mostly from institutions who would not be included in the proposed elite and tend to elide or play down the strength of the existing <span>distinctions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh">3 January 1997a</a>; <a href="#timh">10 January 1997d</a>).

Some <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>take a more radical stance, arguing that the idea of uniformity among <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>is a fiction which only commands conviction among members of the university system itself (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh">3 January 1997b</a>).  In a departure from the <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>pattern, one member of the <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>non-elite does argue for formal differentiation of the functions of <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and the extent to which they should engage in research (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh">3 January 1997b</a>).  </p>

<p>The consensus of academic sentiment, as indicated by a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>conducted before the RAE results were announced, is against  a formal elite (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh">10 January 1997c</a>) and this could be connected with the <span>numerical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>predominance of the <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>non-elite.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>more subtle <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to calls for an elite, again emerging the from the <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>non-elite, is an advocacy of diversity, coupled with an insistence that a differentiation of functions, for instance between <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and research or regional, national and international <span>roles</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> need not be equated with a hierarchy (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh3">7 February 1997b</a>).  The implied distinction between <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and value may be valuable, particularly for con0ering <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>development, but, in the immediate context
of competitive allocation of resources, does not command full conviction - Aesop's fox was convinced the grapes were sour.</p>

<p>Covert elitism is sometimes detected in the decisions taken on the <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of funds (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh4">18 April 1997a</a>).  Neither the <span>ratios</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>assigned to RAE grades, nor the factors to be applied to subject groups (Band A: high cost <span>laboratory</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>or clinical subjects; Band B: <span>intermediate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>cost subjects with a technical, <span>experimental</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>or practice-based element; and Band C, for all other subjects), were known prior to the announcement of the RAE results.  There was a general understanding, which <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>incorrect, that 5* (Research <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>that equates to attainable levels of international excellence in a majority of sub-areas of activity and attainable levels of national excellence in all others) was reserved for recognition and would not carry extra funding (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh4">18 April 1997a</a>).  The publicly stated reason given by HEFCE for not specifying differentials in advance was to protect the objectivity of the assessment process (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh4">18 April 1997a</a>).  Comments elicited from institutions favoured by funding decisions tend to view them as just whereas those from disadvantaged institutions <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>them as inhibiting <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>developments which would be valuable to the system as a whole (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh4">31 January 1997c</a>).  The acknowledged need for compensatory <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to ensure system <span>stability</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>during transition points to the increased sharpness of the differentials (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh4">28 February 1997a, b, c </a>).  In this context, we are dealing with processes of dissemination and diffusion <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to those following on the RAE results themselves, with the messages giving funding decisions (reported in (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh3">24 January 1997</a>)) and the slower development of understanding of their implications.</p>

<p>Funding decisions are policy <span>instruments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>which descend to the
level of institutions but not to research groups within or across
institutions.  Research Councils form the other component of the
dual system of public research funding operative in the United
Kingdom and their <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of interest is the research group or project
not the institution.  Concerns have been expressed about the lack
of full support for research infrastructure (including library
and information services) <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>by Research Councils (<i>Times
Higher</i> <a href="#timh4">28 March 1997a</a>; <i>Guardian Higher</i> <a href="#guarh">8 April 1997</a>).
 Universities also have autonomy in their internal distribution
of RAE funds.  These factors which might enable research group
or intra-institutional autonomy and <span>limit</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>the reach of RAE funding
differentials as a policy <span>instrument</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>are constrained by the prestige
conferred by high RAE gradings.  Prestige acquires an economic
value by its role in attracting research funding from public,
and from private, agencies (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh3">21 February 1997c</a>).
 It can also influence intra-institutional allocation of funds,
although <span>conflict</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>is still apparent, particularly in connection
with <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>rated research groups within weaker institutional
<span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(<i>Guardian Higher</i> <a href="#guarh">18 February 1997a</a>).  Yet the
overall effect appears analogous to the Matthew effect ('unto
every one that hath shall be given'), known to studies of scholarly
communication in the form of the accumulation of citations by
the already highly cited.</p>

<p>The department represents a significant level of <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>immediately
below that of the institution.  More technical issues, such as
the research grade and staff:student ratio required to avoid intra-institutional
cross-sub0y, are confined to the esoteric literature.  Departments
closed, or threatened with closure, on the <span>grounds</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of low grades
obtained in the RAE are also reported in esoteric <span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of
the exoteric literature (<i>Guardian Higher</i> <a href="#guarh">4 February 1997</a>).
 In one instance, an appeal is made through an exoteric forum
on behalf of a department threatened with closure despite good

<p>A final level of <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>is that of the individual employed by a university.  The idea of the individual or cluster of individuals as the locus of research emerges in the esoteric and exoteric media.  In esoteric media, there is discussion of the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of assessments of individual researchers by assessment panels and internally by <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh4">28 February

It should be noted that this represents a transformation of the <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>assigned to grades: these refer to relative proportions of sub-areas of research (which may be identified with individuals) at levels of international and national excellence not <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to individuals.  Informal conversations <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>that this transformation, which enables finer <span>distinctions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>than international/national (a 7 point scale is in use), has permeated the shared language of academic discourse.  </p>

<p>The transformation of the interpretation of the grades can be <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>from classic perspectives on language.  <span>Wittgenstein</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>urged, <i>'Let the use of words teach you their meaning'</i>, and further <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>that, <i>'For a <b>large</b> class of cases - though not for all - in which we employ the word <b>meaning</b> it can be defined thus; the meaning of a word is its use in the language.' </i> (<a href="#witt">Wittgenstein 1958 </a>: 43 and 220)  From this <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> we should recognise
that original <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>have not fully prescribed the use of grades, although they have been strong influences, and examine the use of grades to discover their meaning in use.  The structuralist <span>principal</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>that meaning is a product of <span>mutual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>differences between items in a system (<a href="#saus">Saussure 1983</a>) would account for the <span>differential</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>interpretation of grades.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>highly specific analogy is provided by Saussure's brief discussion of artificial languages: the creator of an artificial language only controls it so long as it is not in circulation; once in general use it develops according to influences
which have nothing in common with its logical interpretation (Saussure 1983:76).  Influences apparent from the development of the artificial language of the grades are a desire for finer differentiation
than the binary contrast national/international and a tendency towards individualism.  Disciplinary cultures will emerge as a further influence.</p>

<p>In esoteric and exoteric media, particularly in the early stages of diffusion, the individual as the locus of research emerges in anecdotes which take the talented individual trapped in an indifferent or declining context as their theme (one <span>senses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>a transformation of the Christian and romantic motif, present in popular histories of science, of a prophet without honour in his own country).  Reports of research assessments of individuals, characteristically cast in terms of RAE grades, being used to
determine conditions of work, including the <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of duties across research, <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and administration, promotion decisions, salaries paid, and the continuity of employment, emerge first
in esoteric media (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh3">7 February 1997a, c</a>; <a href="#timh4">28 February 1997d </a>; <a href="#timh4">28 March 1997a, b</a>).  The issue of continuity of employment may then be diffused, after some delay, to exoteric media (<i>Herald</i> <a href="#hera">18 April 1997</a>; <i>Sunday Times</i> <a href="#sund">30 March 1997 </a>) and their esoteric <span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(<i>Guardian Higher</i> <a href="#guarh">18 February 1997b </a>; <i>Independent Education</i> <a href="#inde">24 April 1997</a>).  Non-academic employees, and other implications of changes in university funding for local economies, are characteristically neglected.  Hints of a more systematic <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> not <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to anecdote or reports of current events, are <span>contained</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in observations of a convergence with United States patterns of employment for university academic
staff (<i>Sunday Times</i> <a href="#sund">30 March 1997</a>) and of the dangers of reinforcing effects on research differentiations over time, particularly with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to patterns of recruitment of individuals.</p>

<p>In summary, then, although a debate on the organisation of <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>is signally initiated in an exoteric forum, the <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>discussion largely migrates to esoteric fora.  More technical issues are
confined to the esoteric literature while employment issues, which <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span><span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>academics share with other citizens, permeate to the exoteric literature.  The concatenation of effects from national decisions to individual academics, particularly those associated with funding differentials, ensure that traditional scholarly isolation, itself misleading as an image of actuality, has been invaded by effects induced by a competitive external <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h4>Disciplinary issues</h4>

<p>Disciplinary cultures can be discerned as influences on the process of assessment and upon the reception of grades obtained.  For instance, philosophy, particularly <span>analytic</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>philosophy, might insist on strictly logical and numerically precise interpretation of the <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>attached to RAE grades and this is <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>implied in the intemperate protest already noted (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh">3 January 1997c</a>) (and is <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>by informal <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>with members of the philosophy assessment panel).  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>managerial understanding of the value of strategic development over time can be sensed in Warwick Business School's guarded <span>expression</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of regret at not obtaining a 5* (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh">27 December 1996</a>).  From history, the process, although not the broader context, of assessment is examined with <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to narrative detail (<i>Times Higher</i>
<a href="#timh">10 January 1997c</a>).</p>

<p>Contrasts within and between disciplines are asserted to have
had critical effects on the value attached to different forms
of research by assessment panels, in apparently independent <span>contributions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>
 Within philosophy, Anglo-American <span>analytic</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>philosophy (whose
dominance in the process of assessment has been suggested) is
accused of being unsympathetic to continental European philosophy
and of undervaluing <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in this tradition (<i>Times
Higher</i> <a href="#timh4">28 February 1997e</a>).  The different understandings of
a <span>discipline</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>revealed with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to philosophy would be characteristic
of the human and social sciences where contrasting <span>paradigms</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>may
be <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>simultaneously, rather than successively, by different
groups, and, where, to a lesser extent, some members of a paradigm
may disparage work produced in another.  Within the natural sciences,
where successive <span>paradigms</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>are the <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>pattern (<a href="#kuhn">Kuhn 1970</a>),
there are traces of similar conflicts, although groups are marked
by more clearly <span>differentiated</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>labels.  For instance, environmental
sciences <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>that they have been disadvantaged by a failure
of understanding (or strategic group self-protection) by assessors
from the earth sciences (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh">10 January 1997f</a>).
 The extent of understandings shared between the parties involved
seems, then, <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to influence the process of assessment.</p>

<p>A contrast which emerges across a number of disciplines is between
theoretically and practically oriented research, with reports
of a higher value being placed upon theoretical research.  Comments
<span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>that this creates particular <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>for areas of
study allied to professional practice, where, in addition to an
ethos not oriented towards research, a dominant <span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of investigation
may be <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span><span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh">3 January 1997d</a>;
<a href="#timh2">7 February 1997d</a>; <a href="#timh4">7 March 1997a</a>).  It is also perceived as a discriminating
factor between groups of institutions, disadvantaging the new
<span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>which are developing their research activities within
an inherited and continuing <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and possibly local orientation
(<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh2">31 January 1997e</a>).</p>

<p>Contrasts between disciplines point to the social natures of the
processes of communication and negotiation by which RAE gradings
are constructed.  Different panels <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>assessment criteria
in distinctive ways which can plausibly be connected with their
disciplinary culture.  Cultural dissonance between parties can
result in outcomes perceived as unsatisfactory by the disadvantaged
party.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>critical <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of <i>inter</i>-panel contrasts would
be that grades obtained, despite their nominal <span>equivalence</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> do
not refer to commensurate levels of research across disciplines.
 Any further study based upon <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis of grades,
conceived as data, must recognise this, although a standing danger
for such studies is to neglect reservations originally made on
the commensurability of data.  An analogy can be made with citation
analysis, where the specific <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of particular citations
can be <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>when they are manipulated in aggregate form.  Although
grades are not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>fully comparable as indicators of the
level of research, they are made commensurate when they are re-interpreted
for their exchange value, as factors for the allocation of funds.</p>


<h4>Research and teaching</h4>

<p>Conflict between the demands of research and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>is frequently
reported.  This is primarily seen at the level of individual motivation
and the <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of time and energies encouraged by the extrinsic
rewards, such intra-institutional career development and the possibility
of inter-institutional mobility, regarded as primarily associated
with research.  Teaching is seen as a localised activity which
may, and, even then only uncertainly, attract intra-institutional
rewards (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh2">31 January 1997f</a>).  The aggregate
tendency of individual motivations is regarded as encouraging
an institutional <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>on research rather than <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(<i>Times
Higher</i> <a href="#timh4">7 March 1997c</a>; <a href="#timh4">18 April 1997b, c</a>).  Some contributors
recognise this and argue for <span>extrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>rewards for <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>which
would change institutional foci (<i>Guardian Higher</i> <a href="#guarh">22 April
1997
</a>), possibly with systematic differentiations between the degree
of institutional orientation towards <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>or research (<i>Times
Higher</i> <a href="#timh2">17 January 1997c</a>).  <span>Elements</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of strategic positioning,
with arguments for recognition for <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>emerging from institutions
with low research ratings and an inherited <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>on <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>
can be discerned.</p>

<p>The value of the products of  research to the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>process
is seldom discussed.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>significant, if <span>familiar</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> distinction
is made between <span>textbooks</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span><span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to assist <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>and research
published in refereed journals.  The low value attached to textbooks
in the RAE is regretted (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh4">18 April 1997c</a>).  Contributions
reveal, in a rather unreflexive way, the patterns which have been
discerned in the transmission of scientific knowledge; textbooks
are <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to the initial stages of induction into a scientific
community; the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>scientific literature is studied at a later
stage (<a href="#kuhn">Kuhn 1970</a>).  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>more sophisticated understanding of the
processes of diffusion from research to instructional literature
is absent.</p>

<p>In summary, then, the frequency of references to a tension between
research and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>points to the depth and pervasiveness of
the experienced <span>conflict</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>  It is perceived primarily in at the
level of the individual (even where it is claimed that good researchers
tend to be good teachers (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh4">18 April 1997c</a>))
and only secondarily in systemic terms.  Intra-professional issues,
such as career development, are largely confined to the esoteric
literature; the exoteric literature is primarily concerned with
the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> educational experience, although the
motivation of staff towards <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>is acknowledged as one factor
influencing this.</p>

<h4>Culture of accountability</h4>

<p>The RAE could be regarded as part of the contemporary <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>on evaluation and assessment, with numerically manipulable outcomes being preferred.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>few <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>recognise this (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh3">21 February 1997d</a>; <i>Herald</i> <a href="#hera">26 February 1997</a>), although the RAE is not always fully contextualised in this respect.  Where the influence of a culture of accountability is recognised, the unproductive labour involved in reporting and the absence of a holistic view of a university's activities can be regretted (<i>Herald</i> <a href="#hera">26 February 1997</a>).  Increased government control of research is also denounced (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh4">7 March 1997b</a>).</p>

<p>A critical, and widely recognised (<a href="#hefc">HEFCE 1997</a>, paragraph 36), <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>associated with evaluative measures is change in the behaviour of the objects evaluated in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to known or anticipated assessment criteria.  Nominal improvements can <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>without substantive  developments.  Features of research identified which could be regarded as examples of responsive changes include: changes in patterns of publication towards refereed journals and monographs from academic publishers (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh3">28 February 1997e</a>); a <span>reduction</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in communication with other disciplines and a wider public (<i>Guardian</i> <a href="#guar">2 April 1997</a>); a change in academic culture when compared to the 1950s and 1960s (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh3">21 February 1997e </a>); and, perhaps most disturbingly, a redistribution rather than increase in research activity.  When theorised, these are regarded as 'inadvertent effects' (<i>Times Higher</i> <a href="#timh2">17 January 1997d </a>) rather than <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>connected with understandings of accountability.</p>
 
<p>The results of evaluations, when made public, can be adapted to <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>for which they were not originally <span>intended</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>  RAE results appear, together with Teaching <span>Quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>assessments, in articles in the exoteric media <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to inform student <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>(<i>Times </i><a href="#timh2">28 January 1997</a>; <i>Independent</i> <a href="#inde">6 February 1997</a>).  In this respect, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>would seem to be conceived as potential consumers of educational products and are provided with measures to sharpen their capacity for discrimination between products.</p>

<p>Reflection on the RAE from the <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of a culture of accountability suggests some strong, possibly conflicting, tendencies, which may have significant <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>implications.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>continuing stress
upon monitoring and directing the use of public funds and upon the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of research products can be anticipated.  Within this broad context, and particularly from the <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of funding councils, there might be a temptation to change methods and criteria in order to prevent nominal adaptation being pursued at the expense of substantive developments.  Yet the unproductive labour associated with the RAE and the wariness of unintended, and unwelcome, effects <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>resistance to assessment and to changes which would increase its burden.  Finally, the literature betrays a disturbing <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of support for the positive functionality of the RAE.</p>

<h4>Analogy with the organisation of professional football</h4>

<p>An analogy is repeatedly made between the transfer patterns and
league <span>tables</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of professional football and those associated with
the RAE (for instance, <i>Guardian Higher</i> <a href="#guar">7 January 1997</a>,
<a href="#guar">14 January 1997a, b</a>).  The analogy may have an unexplored depth.
 The concept of place was <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to the development of professional
football, so fundamental that is critical role was only fully
noticed when disturbed.  Labour rapidly became mobile and the
<span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of this has recently increased.  The relative importance
of place has been further eroded by the power of entrepreneurial
capital.  <span>History</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>may only remain an influence for maintaining
<span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>when the circumstances which assisted development are renewed.</p>

<p>Analogous developments can be detected in the organisation of
<span>universities</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>  Labour has long been mobile but the relation of
an academic to their institution is increasingly being laid bare
as one of selling the products of intellectual labour.  Place
is still significant although the pleasure of location could be
regarded as a surrogate for salary differentials.  <span>History</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>seems
most significant to those institutions, the new <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of
the 1960s and 1990s, which inherited cultures not fully adapted
to a research <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>  Long duration does not by itself guarantee
high current <span>significance</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The deeper analogies between the organisation of professional
football and the <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of university research are read
from, rather than stated or even implied by, the contributions
which <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>similarities in transfer patterns and league <span>tables</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>
 As such, further exploration is beyond the scope of this article.
 Yet it is disturbing that potentially highly revealing aspects
of an analogy are left below the level of deliberate implication
and does again <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>the rather unreflexive and unsophisticated
character of the public discussion of the RAE.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The approach taken here contrast with other <span>treatments</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of the
research assessment exercises in the information science literature.
 In summary, they have taken the research assessment exercises
as a given and concentrated on adapting <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>techniques,
particularly, although not exclusively (<a href="#hodg">Hodges <i>et al.</i> 1996</a>),
citation analysis (<a href="#oppe">Oppenheim 1995</a>; <a href="#seng">Seng and Willett 1995</a>), to the evaluation of research.  The use of these techniques in assessment
is then advocated as more economic than the procedures which have
been used in the research assessment exercises.</p>

<p>A broader responsibility to inform discussion of the research assessment exercises and their effects from understandings of scholarly communication and of the development of knowledge has not yet been <span>accepted</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>  Some possible <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>can be indicated.  The idea of discourse communities and of scholarly communication as a public conversation (<a href="#wils">Wilson 1983</a>) could help identify the changed interval between public <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>required, particularly in the humanities, by research assessment procedures as a critical development.  The value of a continuous public conversation to the development of eminent researchers could also be explored.  Most critically, the known productivity of margins and transitions could be used to counter calls for an elite of institutions and to point to the dangers of rigidity and stagnation associated with restrictions on entry to scholarly communities.  In some respects, for instance, in their <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>to the processes of peer review, the studies sponsored by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) (<a href="#hefc">HEFCE 1997</a>; <a href="#mcna">McNay 1997</a>) have been more sophisticated and comprehensive in their understanding of scholarly communication than those emanating <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>from information science.</p>

<p>The approach adopted in this article has been informed by understandings
of scholarly, and other, forms of communication.  The rather heterogeneous
voices emerging in the public reception of the RAE have been assimilated
to a model of communication which makes a <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>distinction
between exoteric and esoteric, or extra- and intra-communal, media.
 Forms of communication not <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>studied, such as intra-disciplinary
con0erations of the process of assessment for that <span>discipline</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>
could also be <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>in terms of this model.  In contrast
to the HEFCE sponsored studies, which are inevitably historical
in character (a study (<a href="#mcna">McNay 1997</a>) deals with
the impact of the 1992 Research Assessment Exercise), the data
<span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>by public <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of the RAE is more current.  It
also give the impression of being richer, fuller and more diverse
than that gathered by questionnaires or elicited from <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>groups,
where possible responses are, to some extent, constrained by the
categories brought to the study by researchers.</p>

<p>The analysis and categorisation <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>here may have given an
appearance of systematicity to a diverse set of <span>contributions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>
 Reflection on <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>does identify a fundamental responsibility
for funding councils: to ensure that evaluative methods, while
producing meaningful <span>distinctions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>between <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>assessed, contribute
to the health of the system as a whole.  The tenor of the public
discourse studied here suggests that this responsibility is unlikely
to be assumed by individual institutions.  The individual rational
economic self-interest of  members of a system may not maximise
group or wider communal benefit.  Councils may wish to work towards
ensuring the coincidence of institutional interest and social
benefit.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>fuller understanding of the forces influencing  research
<span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>can assist the construction of policies towards that desirable
end.  The value of this study would be in contributing towards
the development of that understanding.</p>

<p>Finally, it could be suggested that while an institutional context
can encourage an appropriate motivation towards research, it cannot
impose it.  Roland Barthes' exhortation, although addressed to
the young in research, remains inescapable:</p>

<blockquote>The task (of research) must be perceived in desire.  If this perception
does not <span>occur</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span> the work is morose, functional, alienated, impelled
solely by the necessity of passing an examination, of obtaining
a diploma, of insuring a career promotion.  For desire to be insinuated
into my work, that work must be <i>demanded</i> of me not by a
collectivity seeking to guarantee my labor and to gain a return
on the loans it grants me, but by a living <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:111px 37px 111px 37px;position:relative;">.</span>of readers.' (<a href="#bart">Barthes 1986</a>: 69-70)</blockquote>

<p>And, in every new project, we may remain young.</p>

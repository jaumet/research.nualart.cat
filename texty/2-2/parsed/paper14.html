<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As previously reported in Information Research (<a href="#loug95">Loughridge & Greene, 1995</a>)  a study of the management information needs of academic Heads of Department in <span>universities</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>  using a <span>Critical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>Success Factors approach, was conducted in 1994/1995.  This study has now been completed and a report submitted to the British Library Research and <span>Development</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>Department which funded the research (<a href="#gree96">Greene, et al., 1996</a>).  The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span><span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>and recommendations of the study are summarised here.</p>

<p>A <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>of sixteen <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span><span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>was developed, based
principally on age, history, size and the nature and <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>of
academic disciplines <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>within them.  In each of the
selected institutions, the University Librarian (or, in one case,
a Deputy Librarian) and two or, in some cases, three academic
Heads of Department were interviewed, as were a number of senior
administrative staff such as Registrars, Secretaries and Finance
Officers and the Heads or Directors of more specialised units
such as Industrial <span>Development</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>Units.  The academic Heads of Department
were selected on the basis of their department's rating in the
research assessment exercise in 1992 and the mix of undergraduate
and postgraduate <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>within departments. Departments were
also chosen to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>of disciplines currently found
in <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>in order to produce, in a sense, a 'virtual' university.
 In all, 44 Heads of Department, 19 senior administrative staff
and Directors or heads of  specialised <span>units</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span> and 16 Librarians
(15 Heads of library services and 1 Deputy Librarian) were interviewed.</p>

<p>The <span>principal</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>objectives of the study were to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>the
factors which academic Heads of Department con0ered critical
to the achievement of their organisational goals, and the nature
and <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>of management information support provided by central
administrators, libraries and ancillary support services to enable
them to achieve these goals.  Academic Heads were also asked about
their <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>of their <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>in their department and institution,
about developments in institutional management styles and practices
and about their views of mission <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>and strategic plans.</p>

<h2>Results: Academic Heads of Department</h2>

<p>The interviews with the academic Heads of Department suggested
that their role and their <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>of their role varied according
to how long they had been in office, the basis on which they held
office and their <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>within their institution.  In general,
where Heads of Department were elected and of professorial rank,
there was a tendency to see the role as being that of an academic
<i>leader </i>rather than an academic <i>manager</i>.  However,
even amongst those who <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>this view it was clear that the corporate
managerialist culture now prevalent in many <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>required
academic Heads of Department to become much more managerial in
behaviour and outlook than hitherto.  Some, especially in the
older <span>universities</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span> felt that this <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>challenged their perceptions
of how academic departments should be run though most believed
that in a higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>sector increasingly dominated by external
assessment most <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>could no longer be seen as collegial
institutions but as organisations responding to corporate imperatives.</p>
 
<p>While there was little enthusiasm for mission <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>con0erable
interest was shown in <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>strategic plans. Of the total of
12 departmental goals suggested by Heads of Department, teaching
and research, not surprisingly, were the most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>identified
while maximising staff potential and generating income were also
highly placed.  It was also generally <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>that more attention
had to be devoted to management of resources, maintenance and
development of external <span>links</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span> and improved <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>to external
demands, and that more needed to be done to attract <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>and
position departments appropriately. </p> 

<p>Some Heads of Department were at first reluctant to attempt to
identify <span>Critical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>Success Factors (CSF), and in some cases there
was initially a misunderstanding of what was meant by the <span>term</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>
but it was <span>eventually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>possible in all cases to elicit useful and
relevant <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>of CSFs.  Heads of Department clearly felt
that a wide variety of CSFs was needed in order to achieve their
organisational goals.  Among the twenty-four CSFs identified there
was a clear distinction between internal and external factors,
the <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>between these being dependent on four key influential
factors: political and economic <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span> institutional <span>setting</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>
relative position of  the department and departmental culture.
 Of the twenty-four CSFs mentioned ten related to factors 'external'
to departments such as their relationship with various professional
or academic communities and were generally oriented towards research
and income generation while fourteen were more related to 'internal'
goals such as <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>and personnel management.  Successful research-led
departments in older <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>were more likely to be externally
focused than historically largely teaching-oriented departments
and, in the former, Heads of Department were found to place great
<span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>on the maintenance and defence of 'traditional virtues'
such as academic freedom and autonomy from the external environment
within their departments.  In the newer <span>universities</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span> on the other
hand, there was a closer interface between the university centre
and the departments and a generally more managerialist culture.
 However, there was <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>agreement amongst all Heads of
Department interviewed about the importance of external relations,
public relations, course <span>design</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>resources, monitoring
and evaluation procedures and student recruitment.  Relations
between their department and their university seemed to be more
of an issue for Heads of Department in newer <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>than
for their colleagues in older institutions, partly because those
in older <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>tended to have a greater <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>of autonomy
and the newer <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>tend to have a more top-down managerialist
approach to academic staff.  There was also some divergence between
these two groups on the importance attached to academic recruitment,
information support and protection of the distinction between
research and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>time, with research and funding receiving
greater <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>in the older <span>universities</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>  There were also wide
differences on the issues of resource management and staff development
policies, with those in the newer <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>placing greater
stress on these.</p>  

<p>In terms of their management information needs it was clear that
the Heads of Department were all largely dependent upon their
informal <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>of contacts for information.  They did not expect
to receive any management information support from their library;
for them, libraries were <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>an academic support service
for <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>and research and had only a minor role, if any role
at all, in the provision of management information.  They felt
that libraries should not look to offer the <span>sorts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>of information
they required to manage their departments, partly because of the
importance of the informal sources of information already referred
to and partly because such services were already <span>supposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>to be
delivered by other agencies within their <span>universities</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>  The development
of management information services by the library would simply
be a further burden on the library and create a further opportunity
to overload Heads of Department with information.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>substantial
proportion of Heads of Department felt that the management and
financial information support provided by their university was
poor; it was often provided too <span>late</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>to provide the kind
of information they required and, when provided, was often inaccurate
and too intricate or cumbersome to use effectively.  Many felt
that, far from being the recipients of management information,
they were, for most of the time, net suppliers of such information.
 Too little notice was taken of the requirements of those who
used the management information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>already in place.</p> 

<h3>Results: administrative officers and information provision</h3>

<p>Senior administrators clearly do play a role in meeting the management
information needs of academic Heads of Department, though the
nature and extent of such activity is dependent  on individual
administrators' specific <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>within the university and the level
of responsibility delegated to them by senior management.   Some,
such as the Secretaries and Registrars and Finance Officers, obviously
have a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>role to play while others, such as Heads of Student
Services, felt that their role was much less clearly defined and
was more likely to be fulfilled on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Regardless
of their level of involvement with Heads of Department, however,
there was widespread recognition that the information needs of
Heads of Department were not being adequately catered for.  The
senior administrative officers interviewed, particularly the Secretaries
and Registrars, tended to <span>agree</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>with the Heads of Departments'
views regarding the poor <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>and timeliness of management
information provided from the centre, although they felt that
their own role in this respect was primarily to meet the needs
of their institutions' senior management team and external bodies
rather than those of Heads of  Department.  The administrators
felt that Heads of Department were not always best placed to receive
management information and might in some instances be barriers
to dissemination of it; <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>of overloading them even further
it might be better to target specific individuals who appeared
to need the information.  The administrators were also concerned
that effort invested in attempting to supply management information
to Heads of Department might be a waste of valuable resources
since the Heads were not sufficiently expert in management and
financial techniques to take full advantage of any information
developments <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>to them.  The services they provided seemed
to be impaired by the <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>many of them experienced in
trying to identify the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>information needs of Heads of Department.
 One reason for this was that it was difficult to identify and
<span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>on those needs in a consistent and helpful way because Heads
of Department were such a disparate group, with individual interests,
<span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>and priorities.  There was a <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>cultural dissonance
between administrators and Heads of Department, with neither group
sufficiently understanding or appreciating the pressures under
which the other worked.  With strong external pressure for accountability
and the need to manage corporately they did not have the time
or resources to devote to what seemed to them to be essentially
second-order information needs.</p>

<h2>Results: the librarians</h2>

<p>Despite recent developments in information technology, closer
operational convergence with academic computing departments in
some cases and the funding councils' change in <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>from information
technology <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>to information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>and information <span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>
the librarians interviewed did not, on the whole, feel that they
had anything to offer academic Heads of Department in the way
of support for their management role. In the current funding climate,
with resources already stretched to the <span>limit</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span> the majority of
librarians felt that they had neither the expertise nor resources
to meet the information needs of academic Heads of Department
and, if seen to be attempting to provide such additional services,
might leave themselves open to accusations of &quot;looking around
for something to do and having spare resources to do it&quot;.
 Where support was given, it was invariably in an ancillary or
<i>ad hoc</i> format.  In one case, however, where the librarian
had responsibility for both computing and library services, this
entailed the need to ensure that any management information networked
locally was in a form that could be <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>and exploited by
Heads of Department, though this was proving difficult to achieve
because of the perceived managerial naivet&eacute; of the Heads
of Department.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The number and variety of both goals and CSFs identified by Heads
of Department <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>that they have had to accept a con0erably
<span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>portfolio of responsibilities and duties than hitherto.
 While <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>and research were obviously <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>to departmental
activities the Heads of Department also recognised the importance
of <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>to management of resources, maintenance and development
of external <span>links</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>to external demands, attracting students
and repositioning their department in the market-place.</p>  

<p>In attempting to fulfil these disparate duties they were, generally,
not well-served by the management information support services
in their <span>universities</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>  Universities, when planning and implementing
information provision <span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span> need to take into account to
a much greater extent than they presently do the perceived or
anticipated management information needs of academic Heads of
Department.  The Heads of Department themselves need greater opportunities
to familiarise themselves with the issues involved in management
information <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span> particularly with the limitations of such
<span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span> and with what they might realistically expect from a
system <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>to meet the disparate needs of a variety of potential
users.  Heads of Department need to be much more closely involved
in consultation on the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>design of management information
<span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>  </p>

<p>There is a need for <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>to clarify and, if possible,
simplify the structure of their information provision.  Currently,
management information of potential use to academic Heads of Department
may be collected, stored and made available (if not always effectively
distributed) by a variety of <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>within institutions, ranging
from Registrars', Finance Officers' and Management Information
offices through Industrial Liaison Offices, Student Services and
marketing and Public Relations Offices to the library.  There
is often <span>duplication</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>of effort and confusion about the specific
aims and objectives of individual <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>and the relationships
between them and, on the part of Heads of Department, often equally
strong reservations about the <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span> value and effectiveness
of the services they provide.  While the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:54px 18px 54px 18px;position:relative;">.</span>and complexity
of the management information required and available may preclude
the development of a 'one-stop-shop' approach to the satisfaction
of Heads of Departments' management information needs there does
seem scope for better co-ordinated use of existing information
technology to support integrated information services rather than,
as may be the case in some institutions, allowing the technology
to influence or determine the information services provided.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The latest evaluation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) on the health <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in Africa recognises District Health Management Teams (DHMT) are not as efficient and effective at delivering <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>health care as they should be. The <i>"weakness of information support is acknowledged by most member states as a persistent obstacle to vigorous and objective management" </i>(<a href="#ref3">WHO, 1994a</a>).<i> </i>A shift towards decentralisation in many low-income countries has meant that more skills are demanded of <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>health care (PHC) managers including data and information handling at all levels of the health care system (<a href="#ref1">AKF, 1993</a>). Ministries of health (MOH) are changing, from centralised reporting health information <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> to health management information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>(HMIS), with <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>on managers utilising information at the point of <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> The new information management <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>are <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to promote an informational approach to management at the district and operational health service level. Organisations which have an interest in training health service managers also recognise the need for more skills, and the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) initiated the development of a training package for PHC managers known as Primary Health Care Management Advancement Programme (PHC MAP). </p>


<h2>Developing and improving health information systems</h2>

<p>Research and reports on information management for health unit and district managers in low-income countries have focused on several issues including: data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and processing (<a href="#ref1">Foltz, 1993</a>; <a href="#ref2">Mock, <i>et al.</i> 1993</a>; <a href="#ref2">Nabarro, <i>et al.</i> 1988</a>; <a href="#ref2">Van Hartevelt, 1993</a>) information use (<a href="#ref1">Bekui, 1991</a>; <a href="#ref1">Keller, 1991</a>; <a href="#ref2">Smith, <i>et al.</i> 1988</a>; <a href="#ref3">WHO, 1994b</a>; <a href="#ref3">Wilson, <i>et al.</i> 1988</a>); or general organisational and management problems (<a href="#ref1">Campbell, <i>et al.</i> 1996</a>; <a href="#ref1">De-Kadt, 1989</a>; <a href="#ref1">Husein, <i>et al.</i> 1993</a>; <a href="#ref2">Sandiford, <i>et al</i> 1992</a>). Many of these problems <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>a need for information which could inform various aspects of operational managers' policy implementation, monitoring, evaluation and planning role, rather than contribute to profiling morbidity and mortality <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>for national use, which was often the aim of <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>reporting health information <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> Moreover, although not explicitly mentioned, an <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>concept in many papers is the need for information management <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that will promote an informational approach to health unit and district level health management. None of the papers mentioned, however, is a review of the decentralised operational manager's role and appropriate information management <span>strategies</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>Despite the many papers, previously cited, concerning problems in health information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in low-income countries, there are relatively few that analyse the development of a new or revised HMIS for operational management, and describe the process in detail. Information system (IS) developers in Ghana (<a href="#ref1">Campbell, <i>et al.</i> 1996</a>) recognised the scarcity of research describing the process of developing HMIS for operational managers. Their case study covers the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>process and makes useful suggestions on how to resolve important issues arising. However, it does not follow implementation in detail, or draw upon existing research and theory to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>their <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> <a href="#ref2">VanHartevelt</a> (1993) <span>discusses</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>the need for an IM approach when strengthening this information system in Ghana, and suggests the <i>"<span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>is only successful when implemented as part of an information strategy leading towards IM which support the organisations' objectives rather than is [sic] an objective in itself". </i>He is, however, referring to intentions, rather than the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>events.</p>

<p>Although <a href="#ref1">Foltz</a> (1993), illustrating her approach with a Chadian case study, focuses on technology transfer to improve a national reporting system, describes development and makes useful recommendations, this IS is not developed for operational management of health services by workers in health <span>units</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> Its success was not <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in terms of using information for management, the existence of analysed data, or information available, at the point of operational management. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>case study of IS development in Niger (<a href="#ref2">Mock, <i>et al.</i> 1993</a>) describes the change from a centralised reporting system to an HMIS, though MOH <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>management, not district or health unit management, is being facilitated.</p>

<p>The research literature lacks in-depth case studies following IS development for operational management in low-income countries, with the aim of interpreting the process within existing theory. Yet <a href="#ref3">WHO</a> (1994a:10) state: <i>Efforts to strengthen national information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>have often produced little improvement and have sometimes made the problems worse". </i>Furthermore, there is a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of research which aims to understand the process <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>place when externally developed training materials, <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to strengthen health management information <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> are <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to potential users in low-income countries. This paper reports on such a research study, using existing theory and research to deepen our understanding.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>This particular East African country, unidentified because of confidentiality guarantees given to key informants, was chosen for this <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>because AKF were introducing PHC MAP there, and research funding was available. The <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>utilises a <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>approach, which is <i>"multi-method in <span>focus</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>an interpretative, naturalistic approach to its subject matter. This means that <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>researchers study things in their natural settings, attempting to make sense of, or <span>interpret</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> phenomena in terms of the meaning people bring to them" </i>(<a href="#ref1">Denzin and Lincoln, 1994</a>). Following <a href="#ref2">Morse</a> (1994), the research strategy was not based on conscious, prior con0eration of philosophical questions, but on the study purpose, research question, and the skills and resources available. We have assumed her position: <i>"if the question <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>the nature of the <span>phenomenon</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> then the answer is best obtained by using ethnography".</p>
</i>

<p>The ethnographic case study undertaken has used participant observation, interviews, official document examination, written field-notes and diaries. Theme development was aided by NUD.ist <span>software</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> Using <a href="#ref2">Phillips and Pugh</a>'s (1994) <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of relationships between theory and <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>evidence, our approach is exploratory as we use theory, not to guide, but to elucidate and to provide further understanding when analysing <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>data. Although initial data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and analysis were not guided by existing theory, we were <i>"theoretically aware"</i> (<a href="#ref1">Glaser and Strauss, 1967</a>) prior to fieldwork. </p>


<p>Initial discussion is facilitated by asking to what extent the <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>evidence is similar to, or different from a particular theory or <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and what areas the theory does not cover. The ultimate aim is to identify a theoretical <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that describes the relationships within the evidence. Subsequent discussion relates the <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>situation to that found elsewhere.</p>


<p>The theoretical constructs of most value have been the diffusion of innovation <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>described by Rogers (1995), and the idea of an organisation as four forces in dynamic equilibrium, mentioned by Leavitt (1965), and elaborated by Leavitt, Dill and Eyring (1973). They believe change in one part of the organisation (Task, Structure, People or Technology) leads to changes in other parts. </p>


<p>The diffusion of innovation <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>is a problem-solving approach, which can help to identify problems in a specific <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and specify a solution, or identify in advance issues that may inhibit or facilitate adoption of a technological change. Diffusion is defined as <i>"the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among members of a social system"</i> and an innovation is the idea, practice or object perceived as new (Rogers, 1995). The decision regarding an innovation is seen as a process, rather than an instantaneous act, and a staged model, the Innovation-Decision Process, is proposed. The first stage is <span>Knowledge</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> and at the Second stage, Persuasion, the individual forms an attitude toward the innovation that is <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>by the innovation's perceived attributes. The Decision stage <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>when an individual engages in activities leading to a <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to adopt or reject. Implementation is characterised by uncertainty of <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>consequences</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> and possible innovation re-invention. Finally, Confirmation <span>occurs</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span></p>


<p><a href="#ref2">Rogers</a> (1995) suggests the <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>stage takes place when an individual or other decision-making unit is exposed to an innovation's existence and gains understanding of how it functions. He describes three types of knowledge <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>by potential adopters including Awareness-Knowledge, which focuses upon the innovation's existence. How-to <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>is the information necessary to utilise the innovation, in terms of quantity to use, and how to use it correctly. Principles <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>deals with the functioning principles <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>how an innovation works, and Rogers suggests it is not necessary to have this knowledge prior to adoption, although chances of appropriate use and success are higher if known.</p>

<p>The second, organisational, approach utilises many of the components above, except <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of the Innovation-Decision process being enacted, the organisation undergoes an Innovation Process. Five stages are described: Agenda-setting; Matching; Redefining and Restructuring; Clarifying; and Routinizing.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Until 1993 the health information system (HIS) in this country was mainly a morbidity and mortality reporting system with information flowing one way, from individual health <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to district and national level. Since then an HMIS, <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to support management of health <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>has been developed and is being implemented. </p>

<p>This was the context into which PHC MAP was <span>introduced</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> at a one-day workshop sponsored by AKF and USAID in 1996. The materials were originally developed to strengthen management information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and the sustainability of PHC and mother and child survival programmes within AKF's own programmes (<a href="#ref2">USAID, 1991</a>). Developers assumed this would be <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>by improving planning and management capabilities of programme management teams, as well as by greater and more appropriate use of information for <span>rational</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>decision-making. Over time, however, they widened the application beyond their own individual project management, to include the government DHMT, although the materials' <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>does not <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>this. </p>

<p>PHC MAP consists of eight modules, each with accompanying trainers' module, plus <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>software and booklets on computers, management tips and problem <span>solving</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> The first module, described as the most important, emphasises information audit. One could see the series as management <span>tools</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> as information management <span>tools</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> as a training package for managers, or as enabling the production of information as a management tool.</p>

<h2>Results: con0eration of the use of PHC MAP</h2>

<p>PHC MAP is an external innovation, not requested by this country's health service providers. However, at a workshop AKF <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>PHC MAP to MOH personnel, international agencies, management trainers and academics. <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>1 models the process of con0ering whether to use PHC MAP, drawing upon the diffusion of innovation <span>framework</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<div align="center"><img src="p83fig1.gif" width=560 height=380 border=0 alt=""></div>

<p>At the <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>stage in the workshop Awareness <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>was given, whilst How-to and Principles <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>was <span>sought</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> There were different and confused <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of PHC MAP and the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of clarity in the definition led participants to develop their own <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of PHC MAP, which often depended upon their own role and responsibilities and how the innovation could help them. Several participants <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to clarify the developers' intentions in producing PHC MAP, and a definitive <span>description</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> This was especially difficult as the developer presenting the series described the purpose and definition in contradictory ways - a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>exacerbated by different <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in the series and publicity material. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>management trainer from an adjacent country, describing his use of the series at the Workshop, defined it in yet another way. How-to <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>was <span>sought</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> as participants wanted to know how to use PHC MAP, for many were confused. Principles-Knowledge was actively <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>during and after the workshop, and different <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>were <span>held</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> One MOH official described the series as having <i>"an informational approach".</i> Another defined the series in terms of allegedly different information management <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>compared to those in the HMIS.</p>

<p>During the Workshop, Persuasion, (or, more appropriately in the circumstances, 'Attitude Formation'), took place when Perceived Attributes were con0ered, including relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability and observability. Compatibility with previous practice was important for potential users and included: the HMIS; the support-supervision-training approach; district health management team (DHMT) skills and management ability; management training <span>emphasis</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> rather than information management training of DHMT; and existing policy. Compatibility with Rogers's 'Prior Conditions' affected people's attitude towards the innovation, and several issues were raised:</p>

<ul>
<li>lack of DHMT time;</li>
<li>need for more financial and other resources in health <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to implement existing training;</li>
<li>DHMT <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in utilising information for management;</li>
<li>the need for logistics, supplies and financial data at district and health unit level;</li>
<li>general financing of health services and training; </li>
<li>believing district medical officers (DMO) were not skilled in prioritising their needs.</li>
</ul>


<p>Moreover, potential users suggested that PHC MAP developers had inappropriately assessed the needs in their country, indicating potential users were con0ering whether PHC MAP met previously perceived needs. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>national MOH official identified the issue of relative advantage succinctly, saying: <i>"But for us to have to approach, to use, an alternative method or system it must have significant comparative advantage". </i>Observability, meaning the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to which the results of an innovation are visible to others, was an important issue. Potential users were concerned about the impact of using the innovation and wanted evidence of utilisation and impact in an adjacent country, though the <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>from that country did not address the problem to the audience's satisfaction. Perceived innovation complexity was apparent, as PHC MAP was seen as difficult to understand. </p>

<p>The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>stage in the process <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>was Redefining and Matching, which took place before the Decision to Investigate Adoption Feasibility. After the workshop, the MOH submitted a funding proposal to AKF, requesting funds and technical assistance to utilise PHC MAP as part of a management-training package, to which supplementary material would be <span>added</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> There was little evidence to <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that this Decision to Investigate was affected by a prior con0eration of organisational need, and personal career advancement <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to be a motivating factor. When Matching, little attempt was made to integrate the proposed PHC MAP training with existing management training and HMIS development and implementation. No review committee was <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>if the innovation fitted existing needs, although matching to an international agenda was paramount. </p>

<p>The country's health services had recently been reorganised, and norms and existing social system structures <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to influence the decision to <span>investigate</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> These influences included: </p>

<ul>
<p><li>health service restructuring through decentralisation;</li></p>
<p><li>the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of patient fees to be retained at the health unit level partly to supplement staff salaries;</li></p>
<p><li>the desire to evaluate any new practice;</li></p>
<p><li>the MOH decision-making process; </li></p>
<p><li>a <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>emphasis on comprehensive PHC policy.</li></p></ul>


<p>Some participants felt that, before deciding whether to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>using PHC MAP they would have to know if there was a <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>gap in health services which the series would fill. The decision <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to be contingent on the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of concomitant change required when implementing the innovation: one MOH official desired minimum disruption. The <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of altering the innovation <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to influence the Decision to Investigate and potential users con0ered making changes to integrate PHC MAP with existing training programmes, HMIS, health policies and skill level. The availability of technical advice, evaluation <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and the ability to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>with other management and organisational factors also <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to influence the Decision to Investigate Adoption Feasibility. The stages have been pictorially described as different stages, yet in reality these merge into one another. </p>

<p>Some non-governmental organisations also submitted funding proposals to AKF, yet, one year later, no funding or technical assistance had been provided. None of the submitting organisations was using the series, which could <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>no Adoption or Rejection decision had been taken as funding was not available, or rejection had occurred due to <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of funding and technical advice. </p>

<p>At the <span>Knowledge</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> Redefining, Matching and Decision stages, the influence of donors, international agencies and innovation developers was apparent. Potential users suggested developers lacked knowledge of the implementation context. As <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>1 indicates, the donors also appear to greatly influence the adoption decision, by providing funding and technical expertise. Other political factors included the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of personal career advancement.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>The complexity of the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>when PHC MAP was <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>has been clarified using Rogers's <span>framework</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> but there are limitations that have necessitated the development of a model that combines Rogers's two models and expands upon them. </p>

<p>The <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>Stage was a useful concept as it allows the researcher to <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that Awareness <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>was given, but How-to <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and Principles <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>was lacking. Consequently Principles <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>should be <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>before, or at the same time as Awareness or How-to <span>Knowledge</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> This is not something mentioned by Rogers (1995), although Campbell <i>et al.</i> (1996) <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that training in new form completion and use of information should be conducted at the same time, when strengthening information <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> They did not draw upon Rogers's work to develop their ideas, however.</p>

<p>Rogers's theoretical <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>does not adequately facilitate understanding of all the evidence, and other work has been useful. Adaptation, reinvention or redefining was occurring prior to the Decision to Investigate and Adoption or Rejection Decision, not during Implementation as Rogers implies. This is not without precedent, as Buttolph (1992) argues <i>"if adaptation is an example of generative learning, then it begins sooner than the implementation stage in the diffusion process".</i> By generative learning she means the learning process <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>place when individuals relate new information to that already known. She suggests individuals may adopt an innovation as they learn about it, and as they relate the innovation to current needs and <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>settings. It may be PHC MAP redefinition was <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>place for reasons identified by Rogers (1995), but redefinition could also be due to developers lacking Principles <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of their innovation.</p>

<p>Potential PHC MAP adopters <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to be con0ering the extent of the change required, before the decision to adopt or reject. This is not a new idea, although Rogers (1995) do not <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>it, and several authors make the distinction between radical and incremental change when trying to understand their evidence. <a href="#ref2">Onstrud and Pinto</a> (1991) advocated research investigating how the amount of change required to an organisation's structure affected adoption of geographical information <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> <a href="#ref1">Greer</a> (1981) also found this was important in relation to medical technologies and some authors have chosen to classify different types of change which occurred when an innovation is adopted (<a href="#ref1">Greer, 1981</a>; <a href="#ref1">Kaluzny, <i>et al.</i> 1977</a>; <a href="#ref2">Orlikowski, 1993</a>).</p>

<p>Rogers's concept of perceived compatibility affecting the adoption decision is less complex than the <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>evidence indicates, and potential users may be drawing upon a conceptual model of organisational change, developed from experience or theoretical knowledge, when identifying factors inhibiting implementation. <a href="#ref1">Leavitt</a>'s (1965) model of an organisation existing in dynamic equilibrium has been useful here. Assuming 'Technology' is PHC MAP, we have found it useful to change 'Task' to 'Strategy', add 'Management Processes' as an additional <span>force</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> and change 'People' to 'Individuals and Roles' following <a href="#ref2">Scott Morton</a> (1991). <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>2 depicts five forces and issues raised. Thus, although PHC MAP developers envisage a technical innovation needing implementation, potential users saw the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>as one of organisational change. The Workshop participants questioned that PHC MAP was aligned to the <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy of the health services in the country or the existing organisational Structure. It was thought that PHC MAP would be inappropriate because the DMT lacked skills in management and information use, upon which the assumed the package depended. Moreover, some <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>the existing management <span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and procedures were at odds with those portrayed in PHC MAP. <a href="#ref1">Avgerou</a> (1993) also criticises national development planning IS developers for not seeing organisational change as part of the <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>development process in low-income countries.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p83fig2.gif" width=560 height=380 border=0 alt=""></div>

<p>The Decision to accept or reject PHC MAP in this country was more <span>complicated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>than the Innovation-Decision Process indicates for it <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to be contingent upon many issues that do not <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>Prior Conditions, <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>or Persuasion. Instead a Decision to Investigate Feasibility was made, with the anticipation that an Adoption or Rejection Decision would be made later, after funding was provided or denied. This is not something that has been found before. Moreover, one of the attributes affecting attitude formation was the <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that the innovation was in <span>conflict</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>with potential adoptee's views of health services organisational change, as shown in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>2.</p>

<p>The strength of donor influence at all stages of the process is apparent and yet political influences are underplayed in Rogers's work. Similarly, the evidence from the case study suggests the PHC MAP Developer and individuals supporting the series' adoption were pursuing personal agendas, yet Rogers's work does not take this into account. That civil servants pursue personal rather than organisational goals, which constrain <span>rational</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>decision-making is not a new concept. Mock <i>et al.</i> (1993) found personal agendas affected implementation of new IS <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to reform the HMIS in Nigeria. Waddington (1992) claims that a recognition of the difference between privately and publicly stated goals was <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to understanding the constraints to <span>rational</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>decision-making at district level in Ghana, and she suggests personal goals may have a stronger impact within those organisations which do not provide <span>reasonable</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>remuneration, job satisfaction and fair treatment.</p>

<p>Finally, developers and presenters <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>not to recognise that PHC MAP was <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to promote an informational approach to management. This was an <span>error</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>also made in Niger (<a href="#ref2">Mock, <i>et al.</i> 1993</a>) as IS developers <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>they were introducing <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>techniques, and only later realised they were introducing a new management approach with wider organisational <span>consequences</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Classical diffusion theory (the Innovation-Decision Process) does not take into account organisational theory in the study of innovations (<a href="#ref1">Greer, 1977:506</a>). <a href="#ref2">Rogers</a> (1962) proposed a scheme to differentiate stage in the innovation process within organisations, thereby further developing the diffusion <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>so that it brought in organisational theory. <a href="#ref2">Rogers's</a> (1995) review of diffusion research includes a <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of the five stage Innovation Process in organisations, as well as the Innovation-Decision process undergone by individuals. The evidence from our research does not fit neatly into the Innovation-Decision Process, and we found the Innovation-Process model more useful, although I have utilised concepts from the classical model. Despite this <span>combination</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> even the Innovation-Process model is not sufficiently comprehensive, as some of the concepts are <span>limited</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> and do not clarify all themes, and compatibility issues relevant to this case study. However, this research has made several <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to theory. It has demonstrated that the diffusion of innovation <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>is applicable to the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of new IM <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and management <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in low-income countries. However, when asking if there was an existing model that our evidence fitted into, several refinements were needed. </p>

<p>Matching the innovation to an organisational problem and even Perceived Compatibility are <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>concepts, because they do not clarify all areas of matching and compatibility relevant to this case study. These limitations imply reduced capacity to account for, or predict, the extent of change needed for successful adoption. Other situations may benefit from the idea of organisational forces being in equilibrium with one another, as an <span>extension</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of diffusion of innovation ideas. <a href="#ref2">Rogers</a> (1995) perceives that single innovations are <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>which have the potential to bring about social change, and several <span>consequences</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> However, it may be useful to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>that, when an innovation is being <span>introduced</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> a cluster of other innovations accompanies it, with implications for practice as well as theory. </p>

<p>Although diffusion of innovation and dynamic equilibrium frameworks are useful, the political nature of the innovation adoption and diffusion process, also needs to be con0ered. <a href="#ref1">Greer</a> (1977:506) criticises the diffusion of innovation <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>because it does not take into account political theory. This <span>criticism</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>still holds, for those themes of a political nature, which arose in this case study, were not explained within the <span>framework</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> Consequently they are displayed graphically as additional issues in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>1 and include personal career advancement and donor influence.</p>

<p>We found the Second stage can be more aptly entitled 'Attitude Formation', <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of Persuasion, and that this stage was even more complex than <a href="#ref2">Rogers</a> (1995) describes. The change of the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>has developed a deeper understanding of the process and projects a potential User <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> rather than the Change Agent's view.</p>

<p>Two decisions were identified in the Adoption process, the Decision to Investigate the Feasibility of Adoption, and later the Decision to Adopt or Reject. Distinguishing the two has implications for practice as Change Agents can target their efforts more specifically.</p>

<p>This research has indicated that organisational theory can further contribute to the diffusion of innovation <span>framework</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> It has yielded an <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of Rogers's diffusion of innovation <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and the concept of organisational forces in equilibrium. The diffusion <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>describes the process, but the organisational model has given the context and reason for aspects of the process. The diffusion model does not predict what needs to change within the organisation when a particular innovation is <span>introduced</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> or to what extent. However, the addition of the organisational model has helped to do this. The research has also confirmed that Scott Morton's refinement of Leavitt's original idea of organisational forces existing in dynamic equilibrium is useful.</p>

<p>The <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of this project have clarified an under-researched area - a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>where the innovation appears not to have been adopted. Other studies have shown the adoption process being undertaken, to some extent (that is with varying degrees of success), but this fieldwork has described a rejection of an innovation in its early stages. It contributes to process research, which involves data gathering and analysis to determine the time-ordered <span>sequence</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of a set of events which has been lacking <a href="#ref2">Rogers</a> (1995). <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> because it has <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>events as they take place it has not suffered from the recall problem, which <a href="#ref2">Rogers</a> (1995) identified as a methodological problem. </p>
</b>
<p>This research has yielded many implications for practice. Some of these reinforce existing guidelines, although this does not negate their usefulness, and others may be new to this substantive area. If some of these implications appear 'common-sense' to some practitioners this is no reason to omit stating them, as evidence from this case study suggests that putting common-sense or guidelines into <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>can be difficult. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span><span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of the guidelines is given in the appendix.</p>

<p>Con0eration of the evidence regarding the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of an external innovation to strengthen information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>suggests a need for a method to clarify Principles knowledge implied by the innovation, or understand likely meanings for potential adopters, before introducing it. The idea of different concepts applicable to different stages implies that Change Agents, who wish to facilitate adoption of innovations need to be aware of the stage in the innovation process of the organisation to facilitate the process.</p>

<p>The idea of distinguishing types of change is useful because it could help promoters when introducing innovation, as it implies the need to have an in-depth understanding of the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>prior to introducing the innovation. PHC MAP <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>as <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>materials for the Masters <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in health management or for DHT management training could be seen as an incremental change innovation. Bringing the informational approach to management is a radical innovation. </p>

<p>Con0ering the organisation as several forces seeking equilibrium and the innovation as one of those forces implies that all stages of adoption and diffusion should <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>this and facilitate alignment. Walsham (1993) suggests an implementation strategy should be informed by a thorough diagnosis of the organisational <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in which the IS will be used. However, we believe the organisational <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>needs to be con0ered at all stages of the process when introducing new information <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>approaches</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> acknowledging that implementing new IM <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>is not only an issue of technological change, but also one of organisational change implies that needs assessments, monitoring and evaluation of the changes needs to be very broad. This will mean greater expense and use of time at all stages of the process.</p>

<p>This research indicates that Change Agents should make themselves aware of the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>into which they introduce an innovation. It would also be advantageous for <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to evaluate the use of the innovation to be identified and <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>by innovation presenters. This could also help to clarify Principles knowledge. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> it is important to demonstrate the potential benefits of using an innovation.</p>

<p>If the intention was to produce a set of training materials to improve information management amongst health managers it could have been improved by:</p>

<ul>
<p><li>a conceptual module which relates information management <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to management tools; </li></p>
<p><li>a conceptual model linking information management and management generally;</li></p>
<p><li>reflecting the training approach, policy, and the organisational, management and presentational <span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>utilised in this particular country;</li></p>
<p><li>identifying common problems and solutions;</li></p>
<p><li>including case studies.</li></p></ul>


<p>The second of these could be the input-process-output <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>which would help managers to understand their activities, as this would point to where information was needed at each stage. However, if managers utilised a different, more relevant conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>for understanding the factors affecting health <span>status</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> and for planning and monitoring health services, this <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>could be incorporated <span>instead</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> recommendations for changing information management should acknowledge these are part of the IS, not isolated issues, and need to be seen in the wider IS organisational context. The overall rationale should be presented in the materials, as well as by presenters. </p>

<p>If the innovation were a completely new management <span>style</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> such as the informational approach to decision-making, this would also need <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>changes in organisational structure to make it compatible with Strategy, Structure, Management procedures and <span>tools</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> and Individuals and Roles as well. Materials aimed to strengthen HMIS should make explicit the information <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>are <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to support a particular management <span>style</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> the informational approach.</p>

<p>This research has indicated that expatriate advisers often spearhead national health information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>development. The case study of the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of PHC MAP questions whether this is an appropriate approach, especially when no needs assessment has been carried out in-country. It would be beyond the recommendations of this research to state that advisers should be from the country of implementation, however, it is clearly important to develop a deep understanding of the country and organisation when developing new IS, including one <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>on the advisory team from the country of implementation could facilitate this. Solutions need to be developed via participation rather than imposition.</p>

<p>Finally, although this research study has demonstrated that the diffusion of innovation <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and the dynamic equilibrium approach to organisational change are applicable to the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of new IM <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and management <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in low-income countries this is more than an academic exercise. These frameworks can also facilitate the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of such innovations and allow practitioners to see this as a staged process needing to be managed. Consequently issues which may facilitate or inhibit adoption can be identified in advance.</p>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<p>This case study has led us to <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>many implications for practice. These are itemised below.</p>

<h3>Definition of innovation</h3>
<p>1. Aid agencies developing and presenting <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>for strengthening information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>should clarify their aims and objectives within the written material and consistently present them. In particular, regarding PHC MAP, it would have been useful if presenters had specified that the <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>improvements in the HMIS and use of information, after using PHC MAP, had the potential to improve management, rather than simply saying the series would improve management and was about data management.</p>

<p>2. Change Agents or others introducing an innovation need to know the Meaning or Principle <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>implied by an innovation prior to introducing it.</p>

<p>3. Change Agents should introduce an innovation's Meaning or Principle <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>prior to, or at the same time as, Awareness and How-to <span>Knowledge</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>4. Change agents and others involved in diffusion need to understand whether an innovation implies a radical change or natural <span>extension</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to an existing system.</p>

<h3>Potential adopter situation</h3>

</b><p>5. To encourage acceptance of new ideas and techniques potential innovators should address the existing problems experienced by potential adopters, and <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>their reality.</p>

<p>6. Change Agents introducing innovations should be aware of the organisational context and influencing factors into which they are <span>introduced</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>7. Change Agents should address compatibility of the innovation with existing practice.</p>

<h3>Organisational change and IM innovations</h3>

</b><p>8. To ensure alignment of new IS technology it is necessary to view the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of an IM innovation as an issue of organisational change and facilitate alignment of all forces within the organisation, including: organisational policy; management <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and processes; Individuals and roles; and the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>power, responsibilities and activities of managers. If that alignment does not exist adjustments will need to be made.</p>

<p>10. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>very broad needs assessment should be conducted prior to introducing IM innovations. This should not simply <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>upon data <span>collection</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> processing and information use, but needs to cover the skill levels and <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>performed, <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>organisational structure, organisational <span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> management <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and management processes in operation. </p>

<p>11. Strategies should be developed to encourage use of management <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and information.</p>

<p>12. HMIS developers should draw upon existing experience and research in the IS area when developing such <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in low-income countries.</p>

<p>13. Aid agencies presenting <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>for strengthening information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>should be aware of the context of implementation and provide <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to evaluate the innovation's use.</p>

<p>14. Materials for strengthening IM should clarify the <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>between information, management <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and management.</p>

<p>15. HMIS improvement should <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>upon utilising information as well as data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>and processing.</p>

<p>16. Materials aimed to strengthen HMIS should make explicit that the information management <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>are <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>to support a particular management <span>style</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> that is the informational management approach, and put <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>in place to support this.</p>

<p>17. Efforts to improve health information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>should prioritise the conceptual frameworks which describe health workers understanding of the factors affecting health <span>status</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span> and which are utilised in planning and monitoring health services. This will help identify relevant information management strategies</p>

<p>18. Recommendations for changing health information management should take into con0eration that these are part of the information system, not isolated issues, and need to be seen in the wider IS and organisational context.</p>

<h3>Stages of diffusion</h3>

<p>19. The <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>of an IM innovation should be <span>accompanied</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>by an opportunity to see the innovation in practice or by a clearly reported trial-by-others.</p>

<p>20. Change Agents should be aware of the adoption stage the organisation is at in order to facilitate the process.</p>

<p>21. Change Agents should be aware that before the adoption Decision is made a Decision to Investigate Adoption Feasibility may be made, and should facilitate this.</p>

<p>22. Innovation reinvention, redefining or adaptation can <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>at different stages in the diffusion process. Steps should be taken to facilitate or discourage this, depending upon the Change Agents' aim.</p>

<p>24. IS developers should not narrow their conception of the problem too early, but allow adequate time for <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>using exploratory methods.</p>

<h3>Cultural issues</h3>

<p>25. In some situations Change Agents and Inventors carry a responsibility which may mean they need to broaden their role. For example a complex innovation may need further explanation and technical support.</p>

<p>26. Potential adopters and Change Agents should be aware that those introducing or facilitating adoption of an innovation have their own personal agendas which do not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:93px 31px 93px 31px;position:relative;">.</span>coincide with the interests of potential adopters.</p>

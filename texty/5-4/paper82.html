<h2>Introduction </h2>

<p>In the years since the development of ARPANet, Internet-based tools of 
Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) such as e-mail and other communication 
applications have become widespread; indeed, they have entered public awareness 
to such an extent that they are discussed everywhere from syndicated advice 
columns and primers on advertising and marketing to scholarly literature in 
disciplines as far afield as Sociology, Literature, and Composition. Similarly, 
with the rapid development of commercial Search Engines and other online 
information retrieval tools, the Internet has become the information resource of 
choice for significant numbers of people. The Internet (and particularly the 
World Wide Web) has arguably become the most successful medium ever for 
combining mass information distribution and communication capabilities into a 
single package. </p>
<p>One of the most significant points at which information and communication 
converge is within what are commonly referred to as virtual communities. These 
most often take the form of discussion forums focusing on a set of interests 
shared by a group of geographically dispersed participants (for an anecdotal and 
dated, but still useful and commonly cited, general discussion of virtual 
communities, see <a 
href="#Rheingold">Rheingold, 
1993</a>). Although an increasing number of virtual communities support 
interaction between participants via multimedia applications such as video 
conferencing tools, Internet telephony tools, webcams and the like, almost all 
rely upon the exchange of texts between writers and readers in an ongoing 
discursive activity. Through such exchange of texts, virtual communities 
function as social spaces supporting textual &quot;conversations&quot; through which 
participants can find both socio-emotional support and an active exchange of 
information (for examinations of the textual dimension of virtual communities, 
see, among others, <a 
href="#Rosson">Rosson, 1999</a>; 
<a href="#Scime">Scime, 1994</a>; 
<a href="#Smith1">Smith, 
1992</a>; <a 
href="#Beckers">Beckers, 
1998</a>.; <a 
href="#Kollock1">Kollock, 
1998</a>; <a href="#Smith2">Smith 
&amp; Kollock 1999</a>; <a 
href="#Porter">Porter, 1997</a>; 
<a href="#Jones1">Jones, 
1997</a>). </p>
<p>However, while there is wide agreement that virtual communities are capable 
of providing both interpersonal interactions and access to information, the 
degree to which they can be seen as specifically information-oriented social 
spaces has been open to some question in the literature. The observation that 
they can function as forums for the open sharing and exchange of information can 
be traced at least back to Howard Rheingold's book, which is, in online terms, 
ancient writ. More recent researchers have also focused on the informational 
aspects of virtual communities. These include <a 
href="#Blanchard">Blanchard &amp; 
Horan (1998)</a>, who have suggested that the exchange and availability of 
information are perhaps the most important aspects of community networks. On the 
other hand, <a 
href="#Wellman1">Wellman and 
Gulia (1999)</a> have argued more recently that &quot;information is only one of many 
social resources that is exchanged on the Net&quot; (p. 172); they have argued, in 
addition, that specifically information-oriented activities within virtual 
communities are relatively minor compared to &quot;emotional and peer-group support&quot; 
and other types of social interactions. Similarly, <a 
href="#Marchionini">Marchionini 
(1995, p. 106)</a>, has suggested that much of the activity in online forums is 
&quot;more like recreation than information seeking; for example, repeatedly changing 
television channels to find something of interest to watch.&quot; And, indeed, some 
CMC literature, drawing upon the &quot;parcel-post&quot; model of communication (<a 
href="#Shannon">Shannon &amp; 
Weaver, 1949</a>; <a 
href="#Tatar">Tatar, Foster, 
&amp; Bobrow, 1991</a>) relegates information exchange to the status of mere 
transfer of facts, claiming that it plays only a minor role not only in 
CMC-supported communities, but in human communication more generally (see, for 
example, <a href="#Riva">Riva 
&amp; Galimberti, 1998</a>; and <a 
href="#Walther">Walther, 
1996</a>). Such arguments valorize, above all, the interpersonal aspects of 
online interaction as opposed to the informational content that may be exchanged 
through communicative interactions. </p>
<p>However, while virtual communities clearly function as forums for both 
information and social-emotional activities - as well as for sheer play and 
outright antagonism - little research has been undertaken to determine the 
relationship between these activities. Little has been done to assess the 
relative frequencies with which they take place, or, indeed, to establish 
whether such a distinction between information-oriented behaviour, socializing, 
fun, and other types of interactions can be maintained. It may be possible that 
social activities, however open-ended or &quot;trivial,&quot; are used in online 
environments to exchange information of various sorts, and that information 
sharing itself is a fundamentally social act. </p>
<p>This essay attempts to lay the foundation for a model of information exchange 
within virtual communities. To do so, it develops a typology of the varieties of 
information behaviour to be found in virtual communities. It draws upon 
theoretical and empirical work emphasizing an environmental model of human 
information behaviour. This typology will be used as the basis for a series of 
future studies of information exchange within several virtual communities. The 
typology, by making explicit the various ways in which participants interact, 
will allow for a more precise measure of the relationship between 
socio-emotional interactions and human information behaviour within virtual 
communities. It will, thus, provide a basis from which to analyze the extent to 
which the two types of activities are intertwined - or distinct - as well as the 
extent to which information exchange is, in fact, a significant component of 
online interactions. In turn, since it will make possible a measure of 
differences between communities in terms of social and informational 
interactions, it will clarify our understanding of the both scope of various 
communities and the attractions that they hold for participants in different 
circumstances. </p>
<h2>An Environmental Model of Human Information behaviour </h2>
<p><a 
href="#Savolainen">Savolainen's 
(1995)</a> research studies non-work &quot;everyday life&quot; information seeking &quot;as a 
natural component of everyday practices&quot; (p. 261). Drawing on <a 
href="#Bourdieu">Pierre 
Bourdieu's (1984)</a> concept of &quot;habitus&quot; - an internalized, socially conditioned 
disposition toward living and information use - Savolainen posits two dimensions 
of &quot;everyday life information seeking (ELIS)&quot;: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Practical information seeking; and 
  <li>Orienting information seeking. </li></ol>
<p>The first dimension - practical information seeking - is aimed at finding 
specific answers to discrete information needs, often operationalized as 
specific questions. The second dimension, however, is a more general activity 
that allows people, as part of their every day activities, to monitor the 
world - or &quot;information neighborhood&quot; - in which they live for any information that 
may be related to their ongoing interests and concerns. </p>
<p>While much information research focuses on practical information seeking 
(see, for only two examples among many, <a 
href="#Belkin">Belkin, 1978</a> 
and <a href="#Kuhlthau">Kuhlthau, 
1991</a>), an environmental model of human information behaviour posits that, as 
<a 
href="#Marchionini">Marchionini 
(1995)</a>, citing John Dewey and Jean Piaget, notes, the primary way in which 
users gather information is &quot;by 'bumping into the environment'&quot; (p. 27). In 
other words, people may simply situate themselves within a promising 
&quot;information neighborhood,&quot; because it is a likely place within which to stumble 
across information of interest, or may use other approaches for ongoing 
monitoring behaviours in order to increase the likelihood that they may come 
across information that is of interest, but may or may not be of immediate 
utility (<a 
href="#Erdelez2">Erdelez, 
1999</a>; <a 
href="#Williamson">Williamson, 
1998</a>; <a href="#Chang">Chang 
&amp; Rice, 1993</a>). </p>
<p><a href="#Bates">Bates 
(1989)</a> refers to such serendipitous information acquisition as 
&quot;berry-picking.&quot; Further, <a 
href="#Chang">Chang and Rice 
(1993)</a> suggest, in an extensive study of browsing, that information 
gathering is often an informal, non goal-directed activity that allows users to 
orient themselves within an information environment, which often takes place 
through active scanning or monitoring, through informal or social communication 
and even through undirected wandering through that environment (see also <a 
href="#Erdelez1">Erdelez, 
1996</a> and <a 
href="#Erdelez2">Erdelez, 
1999</a>, for useful accounts of serendipitous &quot;information encountering&quot;). <a 
href="#Savolainen">Savolainen's 
(1995)</a> work focuses on the role played by the media in such everyday 
information behaviour. However, as <a 
href="#Williamson">Williamson 
(1998)</a> and <a 
href="#Haythornthwaite">Haythornthwaite 
and Wellman (1998)</a> suggest, one's &quot;information neighborhood&quot; is not only 
made up of media sources, but also - and perhaps more importantly - by people, 
including family, friends, neighbors, co-workers, and a shifting network of 
acquaintances. Indeed, as <a 
href="#Haythornthwaite">Haythornthwaite 
and Wellman (1998)</a> point out, the exchange of information is, in any human 
situation, fundamentally a social interaction rather than a mere instance of 
goal-oriented information retrieval or interaction with an information system. 
Thus, information exchange within such a social setting involves not only active 
information seeking, but also communication - including socializing - and other 
types of interactions, all linked though what <a 
href="#Riva">Riva and Galimberti 
(1998, p. 435)</a> call &quot;the shared construction of meanings&quot; and Dervin (<a 
href="#Dervin1">1983</a>, <a 
href="#Dervin2">1997</a>) calls 
&quot;Sense-Making.&quot; While Dervin foregrounds the importance of information in this 
process, Riva and Galimberti explicitly downplay its role; however, as Dervin 
argues, information - as the content of social interaction - provides the raw 
materials from which such &quot;construction of meanings&quot; can take place. </p>
<p>The concept of an &quot;information neighborhood&quot; as an environment within which 
practical information seeking and orienteering information seeking - as well as 
both directed and undirected browsing - can take place is particularly appropriate 
for virtual communities. <a 
href="#Marchionini">Marchionini 
(1995)</a> uses the phrase &quot;information neighborhood&quot; in his discussion of 
browsing behaviours and strategies, specifically in the context of users browsing 
through &quot;extremely large, unstructured databases.&quot; Although Marchionini uses the 
phrase in a strictly metaphorical sense, virtual communities, by combining the 
information environment with collectivities of users who see themselves as 
participants in a community, literalizes the metaphor. </p>
<p>Thus, it is to be expected that virtual communities function as forums for 
both types of information seeking as outlined by <a 
href="#Savolainen">Savolainen 
(1995)</a>: participants come to them both to find answers to specific 
information needs, and to situate themselves within a congenial &quot;information 
neighborhood&quot; where they can, on an ongoing basis, keep a lookout for any 
information related to their general interests and concerns. In addition, 
participation in virtual communities also allows for less formal types of human 
information behaviour such as browsing and information encountering. </p>
<p>Because virtual communities function within a general context of shared 
interests participants tend to be aware of what information is of potential 
interest to others, and can, thus, share that information without necessarily 
going through the formalities of querying an information retrieval system. In 
addition, because virtual communities are situated within the broader 
information environment of the Internet as a whole, information related to the 
interests of participants can often be either embedded within the community by 
posting, or can be easily linked to the community through the use of hyperlinks. 
</p>
<h2>Information Exchange in Virtual Communities: A Typology of Activities </h2>
<p>Virtual communities are structured around ongoing conversations carried out 
through the exchange of texts among self-selected, though often variable, groups 
of writers and readers. Whatever information exchange takes place within a 
community, thus, does so primarily through this ongoing text-based discursive 
activity. As would be expected in a situation in which information is exchanged 
informally as a part of normal and ongoing interactions, explicit information 
exchange is only one kind of interaction in a virtual community, as it is in the 
&quot;real&quot; world. In other words, although human discursive behaviour includes 
activities that are expressly aimed at gathering, sharing, or otherwise using 
information, it is not limited to those types of activities (c.f. <a 
href="#Riva">Riva &amp; 
Galimberti, 1998</a>; <a 
href="#Wellman2">Wellman, Salaff, 
Dimitrova, Garton, Gulia, &amp; Haythornthwaite, 1996</a>; <a 
href="#Wellman1">Wellman &amp; 
Gulia, 1999</a>). Compared to other types of human discursive behaviour, however, 
that which takes place within virtual communities is significantly influenced by 
two primary characteristics of their online environment: first, as noted above, 
almost all interactions are mediated by text; second, these same interactions 
are further mediated by the physical (and, often, temporal) distance between 
participants, and by the use of computer technology to communicate. Because a 
full analysis of this influence is beyond the scope of this article, it must 
suffice to simply recognize such influence, and to note that, while some of the 
following types of activities have analogs in traditional, face-to-face 
communities, others do not; in addition, even those that do often have a 
different flavor when they occur within virtual communities (for a sampling of 
approaches to electronic and textual mediation in CMC contexts, see <a 
href="#Aarseth">Aarseth, 
1997</a>; <a href="#Davis1">Davis 
&amp; Brewer, 1997</a>; <a 
href="#Marvin">Marvin, 1995</a>; 
<a href="#Cutler">Cutler, 
1995</a>; <a href="#Mitra">Mitra, 
1999</a>; <a 
href="#Turoff">Turoff, Hiltz, 
Bieber, Fjermestad, &amp; Rana, 1999</a>; <a 
href="#Stivale">Stivale, 
n.d.</a>; <a href="#Kolko">Kolko, 
n.d</a>.; <a 
href="#Adrianson">Adrianson &amp; 
Hjelmquist, 1993</a>; <a 
href="#Voiskounsky">Voiskounsky, 
1998</a>; etc.). The full extent of such a &quot;different flavor&quot; is also beyond the 
scope of this article; however, as <a 
href="#Etzioni">Etzioni and 
Etzioni (1999)</a> suggest in a comparative analysis of the communitarian 
aspects of virtual and face-to-face communities, it is likely that each has a 
unique way of supporting the information activities of its members. Further, 
part of the &quot;different flavor&quot; of a given community can be seen in the 
particular norms and patterns of acceptable behaviour within the community. That 
is, each community emphasizes its own particular patterns of interaction, and 
sets its own norms and expectations. This typology will provide a basis from 
which to describe such patterns for given communities. The question of the ways 
in which such norms and patterns are developed, communicated, and enforced by 
the community is outside the scope of this article; the author, collaborating 
with Dr. Elfreda Chatman and Dr. Michele Besant, is currently working on a 
related research project addressing this issue.</p>
<p>Virtual communities have the potential to support a wide variety of 
activities related to information seeking, information provision, and 
information sharing, in addition to socializing and other types of interactions. 
The following typology, derived from a substantial body of research into 
interactions in virtual communities and other CMC contexts, as well as informal 
observation of a variety of virtual communities over the past ten years, is 
intended as an exploratory heuristic model, which can be used as a way of 
analyzing interactions within virtual communities in order to determine the 
extent to which they do, in fact, function as information environments as well 
as social worlds for their participants. </p>
<p>At the most fundamental level, behaviours within virtual communities may be 
divided into two broad types: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Non-interactive behaviours, and 
  <li>Interactive behaviours. </li></ol>
<h3>Non-Interactive behaviours </h3>
<p>While all members of a virtual community participate in the activities of 
that community in the sense that they are, at least, the readers of some portion 
of the texts created by other participants, such behaviour does not necessarily 
constitute interaction, which requires what the philosopher <a 
href="#Ricoeur">Paul Ricoeur 
(1976, p. 29</a>; see also <a 
href="#Riva">Riva &amp; 
Galimberti, 1998</a>) has called &quot;interlocution.&quot; While interlocution primarily 
refers to the presence of both a speaker and a listener in a face-to-face event, 
in a virtual community, it requires that participants be willing to be active as 
both readers and writers, that they take a dynamic role in ensuring that the 
discussions remain viable, ongoing, and self-sustaining in the long run. </p>
<p>The primary non-interactive behaviour in virtual communities is commonly 
referred to as &quot;lurking,&quot; which is the act of limiting one's participation to 
the passive role of a reader rather than also becoming a writer. As <a 
href="#Sproull1">Sproull and 
Faraj (1997, p. 39)</a> note, while listeners in a face-to-face encounter are 
still active participants in that encounter, they become almost invisible in a 
virtual community due to the fact that they leave no obvious traces of their 
presence. As <a 
href="#Smith1">Smith (1992)</a> 
notes in a study of the WELL, lurkers can constitute the largest single 
definable element of a community's population; indeed, Smith reports that, at 
the time of his study, 50% of all messages were written by only 1% of the total 
population (for a more recent - and more dramatic - sampling of lurkers, see <a 
href="#Katz">Katz, 1998</a>). 
Still, lurkers must be considered to be important participants in virtual 
communities; even though they are largely invisible, their acts of reading what 
others have written without also writing themselves constitute significant 
information-gathering activities. </p>
<h3>Interactive behaviours </h3>
<p>In a virtual community, interaction requires active posting, or writing of 
messages, in addition to reading of others' messages. Such activity can take 
several forms, which may be preliminarily divided into two fundamental types: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Hostile interactive behaviours, and 
  <li>Collaborative or positive interactive behaviours </li></ol>
<p>Both types of behaviour can be linked to the informational activities of the 
community, as discussed below, and each can be further subdivided into more 
specific types of behaviour. </p>
<h4>Hostile Interactive behaviours </h4>
<p>It has been noted repeatedly, both within virtual communities themselves and 
outside of them, that not all online interactions are very friendly or even 
remotely civil. Indeed, some virtual communities - or, perhaps more accurately, 
all virtual communities at some time or another - can appear to be structured 
around a sort of verbal violence that includes out-and-out dismissive comments, 
vicious arguments involving either a handful of participants or, in extreme 
cases, the entire community. Indeed, some early research into interactions via 
computer-mediated communication channels, building on a theory of &quot;social 
presence&quot; <a 
href="#Short">(Short, Williams, 
&amp; Christie, 1976)</a>, suggested that, due to the lack of auditory, 
body-language, tone-of-voice, and other cues that are available in face-to-face 
interactions, participants in CMC forums would tend to act as though they were 
not in social situations, and would tend to exhibit antisocial behaviours more 
frequently (see, e.g., <a 
href="#Sproull2">Sproull &amp; 
Kiesler, 1986</a>; <a 
href="#Kiesler">Kiesler, 
1986</a>). While more recent research has called these conclusions into question 
<a href="#Walther">(Walther, 
1996)</a>, there is no question that anti-social behaviour does occur in virtual 
communities, as it does in face-to-face communities. </p>
<h4>Flaming </h4>
<p>The most common form of hostile interactive behaviour - and the one that has 
received the most attention - is referred to as &quot;flaming&quot; (<a 
href="#Dery">Dery, 1994</a>; <a 
href="#Millard">Millard, 
1997</a>). Flaming, as it is generally defined in practice, is simply online 
ad-hominem argumentation, aiming neither for logic nor for persuasion, but 
purely and bluntly at insult. Flamewars sometimes erupt over an issue of 
interpretation or when two participants disagree over a point and get carried 
away by their argument, but they most often seem to take on a life of their own, 
as if they were simply ritualized verbal behaviours undertaken for their own sake 
and degenerating into name-calling and the general dismay of the community at 
large. The Usenet newsgroup alt.flame institutionalizes the art of flaming as 
its primary - and only acceptable - activity. In their taxonomy of "reproachable 
conduct&quot; in Usenet newsgroups, <a 
href="#McLaughlin">McLaughlin, 
Osborne, &amp; Smith (1995)</a> list flaming as one of seven fundamental 
categories of such conduct. </p>
<h4>Trolling</h4>
<p>One common cause of flamewars is the act of &quot;trolling,&quot; or of one participant 
deliberately posting a message for the purpose of eliciting an intemperate 
response. As <a 
href="#Tepper">Tepper (1997)</a> 
points out, trolling often takes the form of &quot;flame-bait&quot; - of posting clearly 
inaccurate information as if it were true in hopes of luring &quot;newbies&quot; into 
posting self-satisfied corrections, thus precipitating flames from more 
established community members. </p>
<h4>Spamming</h4>
<p>Because they are often related to the nominal interests of the virtual 
community, both flames and trolling can be considered as part of the information 
behaviour of the community's participants. That is, even though they both clearly 
fall outside the limits of information seeking per se, they both grow out of the 
community's shared area of interest, and often can help to define exactly where 
the limits of that interest fall; both are communicative acts. &quot;Spamming,&quot; on 
the other hand, is defined by the degree to which it transgresses those 
boundaries. Spam is most often defined as the online equivalent of unsolicited 
junk mail, though it can also include any unsolicited information or even any 
unwanted - and extensive - verbiage <a 
href="#Stivale">(Stivale, 
1997)</a>. </p>
<p>Spam is noteworthy in the context of the information behaviour in virtual 
communities because even though it does most often carry information, that 
information is entirely unsought; while it is, likewise, most often unwanted, it 
is, in some cases, welcome, and may even provide needed information to the 
community. However, recipients thus most often perceive it as noise rather than 
signal, and tend to either treat it with vocal disdain or simply to discard it 
as so much junk. While it thus does form part of the information environment of 
virtual communities, it is, most commonly, actively resisted as a source of 
information. The most famous instance of spamming involved two lawyers who 
advertised their services in filling out lottery forms for green cards in 1994 
by posting messages to thousands of Usenet newsgroups, with no concern for those 
newsgroups' areas of interest or receptivity to advertising (see <a 
href="#Electronic">Electronic 
Frontier Foundation, 1999</a>, for an archive of materials related to the 
&quot;Green-card spam&quot;). </p>
<h4>Cyber-rape</h4>
<p>Perhaps the most extreme instances of hostile behaviour carried out purely 
through the exchange of texts within a virtual community have been cases of 
&quot;virtual rape,&quot; the most well-known of which occurred in an online community 
called LambdaMOO <a 
href="#Dibbell">(Dibbell, 
1998)</a>. Like a flame, this virtual rape was directed expressly at specific 
people, and like spam it was made up of unsolicited, unwelcome (and violently 
assaultive) &quot;information&quot; that transgressed the behavioural norms and any shared 
sense of subject scope held by the community. Without downplaying either the 
violence of this incident or the impact it had on its targets, <a 
href="#Dibbell">Dibbell 
(1998)</a> argues that, because it unified the participants of LambdaMOO and 
made them confront the kinds of issues that face communities in the face-to-face 
world, it transformed the MOO from a mere database that they all used into a 
community. In other words, the act of coming to grips with such violence that 
seemed terribly outside the bounds of what was acceptable and that seemed to 
tear at the structure of the community allowed that community to more fully 
define the limits of both information and behaviour more clearly. </p>
<h3>Collaborative Interactive behaviours </h3>
<p>While hostile interactive behaviours have been perceived as somehow endemic to 
virtual communities, and often play a major role in first-person accounts as 
well as in a number of studies of such communities (<a 
href="#Horn">Horn, 1998</a>, <a 
href="#Dibbell">Dibbell, 
1998</a>, <a href="#Dery">Dery, 
1994</a>), others have suggested that flaming and other phenomena are also to be 
found in face-to-face communities, and are, in any case, somewhat rare (<a 
href="#Rafaeli">Rafaeli &amp; 
Sudweeks, 1998</a>; <a 
href="#Lea">Lea, O'Shea, Fung, 
&amp; Spears, 1992</a>). Indeed, as <a 
href="#Walther">Walther (1996, p. 
33)</a> puts it, online interactions take on a strong personal (or, to use his 
term, &quot;hyperpersonal&quot;) element &quot;when users have time to exchange information, to 
build impressions, and to compare values,&quot; just as they do in face-to-face 
interactions. Hostile behaviours, of course, play a role in such a process; 
however, as in face-to-face communities, the most important kinds of 
interactions are those that reinforce the community, through collaborative 
interactions and other types of positive behaviours. </p>
<p>Any typology of such behaviours runs the risk of not being exhaustive and 
must, thus, remain provisional. However, in general, collaborative interactive 
behaviours can be divided into two primary types: </p>
<ol>
  <li>behaviours not specifically oriented toward information, and 
  <li>behaviours directly related to either information seeking or to providing 
  information to other community members. </li></ol>
<p>Both types of behaviours may, since information exchange does take place in 
interactions that are primarily social in nature (<a 
href="#Wellman1">Wellman &amp; 
Gulia, 1999</a>; <a 
href="#Williamson">Williamson, 
1998</a>), be closely linked to the movement of information through a community. 
There may, indeed, be significant overlap - or, at least, the potential for some 
ambiguity - between these two types of behaviour. However, they can be 
distinguished by the degree to which the exchange of information - in terms of the 
seeking or offering of information - is an explicitly motivating factor in an 
interaction. That is, while general orienteering information may be gleaned from 
those behaviours not specifically oriented toward information, such a use is 
neither the most significant aspect nor the motivating factor of those 
behaviours. On the other hand, the sharing and gathering of both orienteering and 
practical information can be seen as the most significant motivating factor of 
those behaviours directly related to information. In addition, they provide a 
useful mechanism for determining the degree to which a specific community 
values - and is built around - the sharing of information as a part of its social 
activity. Future study, using this model, will be required to assess such 
activities, and to assess the degree to which social and informational 
activities do, in fact, overlap each other. </p>
<h4>behaviours not specifically oriented toward information </h4>
<p>There are many possible ways to categorize the types non-information-specific 
positive interactive behaviours that may occur within virtual communities. Almost 
by definition, all interactions within a virtual community take place in public. 
Although participants can send private e-mail from one to another (or can use 
other mechanisms for private communication), such interaction, because it is 
hidden, is beyond the boundaries of the community itself. Because the virtual 
community is constructed through such a public exchange of texts, perhaps the 
primary mode of behaviour within the community is marked by its relation to the 
group as a whole. Writers of messages undertake their activities with a group of 
readers (some of whom are known, and some of whom are unknown) as audience, and 
readers undertake their activities within the context of the messages that 
define the group itself <a 
href="#Jones2">(Jones, 1995)</a>. 
Thus, group behaviours are the sine qua non of virtual communities, and the 
interests and interactions of the group shape such behaviours. The heart of a 
virtual community can be found in the ongoing public discussions that constitute 
its primary activities. Such discussions may be focused directly on a specific 
topic, or may be more amorphous and generalized; they may also be even more 
fluid, carried by &quot;topic drift&quot; into subjects that are only peripherally related 
to the community's subject scope. These discussions, however far afield they may 
drift, comprise the central activity of the community, and are the primary 
mechanism through which information is exchanged and relationships are built. 
</p>
<p>Three general types of activities may be posited for behaviours that are not 
specifically related to information, although such a division must, at present, 
remain provisional,: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Neutral behaviours: Pleasantries and Gossip; 
  <li>Humorous behaviours: Language Games and Other Types of Play; and 
  <li>Empathic behaviours: Emotional Support </li></ol>
<h4>Neutral behaviours: Pleasantries and Gossip</h4>
<p>As in the face-to-face world, participants in virtual communities spend a 
portion of their time simply engaging in what could be considered &quot;small talk.&quot; 
Such exchanges can include various types of semi-ritualized pleasantries such as 
greetings, well-wishing, etc. They can also include other types of formalized 
exchanges used to keep the community abreast of events in the lives of its 
participants. For example, in certain parts of the WELL, participants exchange 
&quot;status&quot; reports, in which they refer to themselves in the third person and 
report on their daily activities. While these &quot;status&quot; reports, because of their 
highly formalized (and even self-consciously awkward) structure, may appear 
unusual to outsiders, they provide an ongoing forum for the kinds of personal 
information that individuals use to maintain a sense of personal contact and 
interest with others. Virtual communities also act as forums for the exchange of 
gossip and rumors (about participants and outsiders, as well as about other 
matters of concern), as a way of supplying much the same sort of ongoing 
community information (<a 
href="#Bordia2">Bordia, DiFonzo, 
&amp; Chang, 1999</a>; <a 
href="#Bordia1">Bordia &amp; 
Rosnow, 1998</a>). </p>
<h4>Humorous behaviours: Language Games and Other Types of Play</h4>
<p>Not all interaction within virtual communities is hostile in nature; at least 
as common is a type of behaviour that could be seen as the opposite: pure play. 
Indeed, as <a 
href="#Danet1">Danet, Ruedenberg, 
and Rosenbaum-Tamari (1998, p. 41)</a> have pointed out, interactions in CMC 
systems can be &quot;strikingly playful,&quot; and are contributing factors to the sense 
of community in virtual communities, even though some researchers have acted as 
though play is inherently threatening to the success of social interactions in 
an online context. Since virtual communities are defined by their basis in the 
exchange of texts, such play is manifested at the linguistic level in the 
playful exchange of texts, through such behaviours as punning, deliberate 
non-sequiturs and other uses of language on a &quot;nonsensical&quot; level, &quot;riffing&quot; on 
particular ideas or phrases or &quot;memes,&quot; or other forms of language play, such as 
the use of abbreviations (such as &quot;IMHO&quot; for &quot;In My Humble Opinion&quot;) in the 
place of common phrases. In a sense, the &quot;status&quot; reports on the WELL, referred 
to above, can be considered such a form of linguistic play even though they are 
primarily used for interpersonal interactions, since they are structured around 
a self-consciously awkward transformation of standard grammatical rules. In 
addition, even though they have primarily been studied as mechanisms for 
communicating emotion, there is a strongly humorous component in the extensive 
use of &quot;emoticons&quot; and other non-verbal typographic symbols - such as the 
integration of programming code in the &quot;signature&quot; files to signify one's 
credentials as a hacker - in CMC interactions (<a 
href="#Witmer">Witmer &amp; 
Katzman, 1998</a>; <a 
href="#Donath">Donath, 1999</a>; 
<a href="#Nowak">Nowak &amp; 
Anderson, 1999</a>). </p>
<p>Play in virtual communities, play is not limited to language use at a micro 
level, but often can provide an overall frame for the actual functioning of the 
community itself, particularly in the role-playing environments to be found in 
MUDs, MOOs, MUSHes, and other synchronous &quot;gaming&quot; settings (<a 
href="#Ito">Ito, 1997</a>; <a 
href="#Curtis">Curtis, 1997</a>; 
<a href="#Turkle">Turkle, 
1997</a>). Such role-playing environments, as <a 
href="#Turkle">Turkle (1997)</a> 
points out, provide forums not only for creating communiies around the 
performative aspects of playing a role via the writing of playful texts, but for 
the creation of new identities and new selves. In some situations, such 
playful activities can even become full-scale attempts to create the online 
equivalents of stage plays, as in the Hamnet Players' online production of 
&quot;Hamnet&quot; <a 
href="#Danet2">(Danet, 
Wachenhauser, Bechar-Israeli, Cividalli, &amp; Rosenbaum-Tamari, 1998)</a>. </p>
<h4>Empathic behaviours: Emotional Support</h4>
<p>As noted above, the ability of virtual communities to provide emotional 
support for their participants has been widely noted. Indeed, communities have 
been formed expressly to provide such support for precisely defined groups of 
users, such as parents of children with special needs <a href="#Mickelson">(Mickelson, 1997)</a>, survivors of sexual abuse <a href="#Reid">(Reid, 1996)</a>, and people with particular health problems <a href="#Preece">(Preece, 1999)</a>. Even in communities that are not explicitly designed as such support groups, the development of interpersonal relationships is common <a href="#Parks">(Parks &amp; Floyd, 
1995)</a>. Such relationships, even though they may be, in some cases, closely 
tied to the specific subject domains of the communities in which they occur, can 
be both intimate and supportive (<a href="#Rosson">Rosson, 1999</a>; <a href="#Wellman1">Wellman &amp; Gulia, 1999</a>). Little specific research has been conducted into the types of interactions within virtual communities that may be used to provide such emotional support, but it seems likely that the full range of positive 
interactions - including both those linked specifically with information exchange 
and those not so linked - create an environment that is felt by participants to be 
supportive and welcoming. Indeed, emotional support and information sharing may 
be closely linked in such situations <a href="#Preece">(Preece, 1999)</a>. </p>

<h4>Specific Information-Oriented behaviours </h4>

<p>As noted above, participants in a virtual community - whether they are active 
writers or merely lurkers - come to that community in large part in order to 
situate themselves within a congenial information neighborhood where they will 
find a likely source for the types of information in which they are interested. 
It is, thus, no surprise that, in addition to engaging in the types of general 
behaviours outlined above, they also use a variety of techniques specifically 
aimed at finding important information. As noted above, some of these behaviours, 
including several of those discussed above, can be considered to be largely 
passive in nature - simply a matter of placing oneself in the right place at the 
right time so that information can be happened upon. Other behaviours, however, 
are more active, and have the effect of transforming the community from a mere 
social gathering into a dynamic information-sharing environment through the 
ongoing discursive activities of the community <a 
href="#Tuominen">(Tuominen &amp; 
Savolainen, 1996)</a>. Such specifically information-oriented behaviours may 
include: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Announcements; 
  <li>Queries or Specific Requests for Information; 
  <ol type=a>
    <li>Queries made by other community members; 
    <li>Queries taken outside of the community; 
    <li>Queries presented directly to the community; and </li></ol>
  <li>Directed Group Projects. </li></ol>
<h4>Announcements</h4>
<p>Virtual communities are ideal forums for targeted announcements. Indeed, many 
of the posts made within them can be said to serve as announcements of one sort 
or another. The making of announcements is a fundamental information sharing 
activity, through which a participant in possession of information that is of 
potential interest to others within the community presents it to those others. 
Some studies of CMC usage in workgroups have suggested that the making of 
announcements, in fact, make up one of the most common activities of online 
groups (<a 
href="#Kettinger">Kettinger &amp; 
Grover, 1997</a>; <a 
href="#Finholt">Finholt &amp; 
Sproull, 1990</a>). </p>
<p>In the context of a virtual community, the act of making announcements plays 
a significant role in the informational economics of the community. Participants 
who share information through making announcements do so in the spirit of 
exchange; rather than simply giving information away, they are exchanging it for 
information that may be held by others. Over time, participants in virtual 
communities act as both active information providers and passive information 
consumers, and are engaged in both aspects of information exchange. This is not 
to suggest that virtual communities employ a highly structured or formalized 
economy of information exchange in which information debits and credits are 
tallied in some type of community ledger. Rather, they are governed more by a 
spirit of a gift economy; information is given freely, and is accepted freely 
when it is received. There have been many discussions of this "gift economy" on 
the Internet, particularly in the context of hacker culture, open source 
licensing and the early days of the Internet's development (see, e.g. <a 
href="#Raymond">Raymond, 
1998</a>; <a 
href="#Barbrook">Barbrook, 
1999</a>; <a 
href="#Kollock2">Kollock, 
1999</a>). It should be noted, however, that virtual communities will, in 
certain circumstances, develop a more formalized economics of exchange; 
particularly if they develop systems for the exchange of goods that are more 
tangible than information (such as, for example, recordings of live musical 
performances), communities may even utilize their own strict systems of 
accounting and record-keeping <a 
href="#Burnett">(Burnett, 
1999)</a>. </p>
<h4>Queries Made by Other Community Participants</h4>
<p>Members of virtual communities are, often, passive beneficiaries of the 
information made available through announcements. In addition, they are often 
the beneficiaries of the information seeking activities of others. Within the 
context of a community's ongoing discussions, it can happen that multiple 
members of that community share an information need at any given time, and that 
only one of them articulates that need in the form of a specific question. In 
such a situation, the other community members need not repeat the question, but 
can gain the information they need directly as a result of another's question. 
</p>
<p>As information environments, thus, virtual communities actively support the 
types of incidental or accidental information gathering outlined by <a 
href="#Erdelez1">Erdelez 
(1996</a>; <a 
href="#Erdelez2">1998</a>) and <a 
href="#Williamson">Williamson 
(1998)</a>. Indeed, much of the information activity taking place within virtual 
communities can be considered incidental information gathering. It could be 
argued that virtual communities are, in fact, specifically structured as 
"information neighborhoods" in such a way to formalize such activities and to 
make them successful. </p>
<h4>Queries Taken Out of the Community</h4>
<p>A third type of explicit information seeking activity that takes place in the 
context of virtual communities takes advantage of the fact that virtual 
communities are neither discrete, self-contained entities nor tightly bounded, 
isolated environments. Because individual virtual communities exist both as part 
of a larger community of communities, and as part of the larger information 
environment of the Internet as a whole, their participants are not limited to 
the information resources provided by the community itself, whether those 
resources are in the form of data stores or in the form of the human resources 
provided by other members. Rather, when it is necessary - when answers are not 
forthcoming from the community itself, or when an individual simply prefers to 
look elsewhere - participants in virtual communities may take their queries 
outside of the community and look for the information to meet their need 
somewhere else on the Internet, or in more traditional information sources such 
as libraries or face-to-face contacts. </p>
<p>Except in those situations in which community participants report to the 
community that they are looking elsewhere for their information, such activities 
remain invisible to the community as a whole. However, because virtual 
communities tend to acknowledge and to take advantage of their status as one 
part of a larger information environment - and because, being self-selected, 
members of virtual communities tend to have some degree of knowledge of and 
competence in using other Internet resources - participants tend to keep an eye 
out for useful resources outside of their boundaries, and tend to keep each 
other abreast of those resources, either through making announcements or through 
answering specific queries with appropriate pointers. </p>
<h4>Queries Presented to the Community</h4>
<p>Finally, the clearest type of explicit information behaviour within a virtual 
community takes place when the information needs of a specific participant are 
articulated, and are presented to the community as a whole in the form of a 
question. Such questions may or may not be answered directly by other members of 
the community in any given instance; and such answers as are given may, in some 
instances, be inaccurate or partial (see, for instance, <a 
href="#Donath">Donath, 1999</a>; 
<a href="#Gurak2">Gurak, 
1999</a>; and <a 
href="#Tepper">Tepper, 1997</a>), 
may reflect the knowledge that is common to the community as a whole but 
previously unavailable to the individual presenting the query, or may 
demonstrate that certain members of the community have knowledge of where else 
to look for answers to queries that are related to the community's area of 
interest; they may also, in some cases, reflect different approaches to 
answering the question, or even substantial disagreement among community members 
the appropriateness of the information requested. In any event, the fact that 
such questions are regularly addressed to the community suggests that 
participants perceive their communities as appropriate forums for them, and that 
they think it is likely that useful answers will be forthcoming. In essence, 
members of virtual communities can function as pseudo information professionals 
or as information intermediaries for each other. </p>
<h4>Directed Group Projects</h4>
<p>While the ongoing discussions of a virtual community may, in some 
circumstances, be nothing more than "talk" - and while incidents of information 
exchange, whether in the form of announcements or queries, may be isolated and 
fleeting - they may also lead to more concrete group projects designed to support 
the interests and information needs of the community, to have an impact in the 
world outside the community (see for instance <a 
href="#Gurak1">Gurak 1997</a> and 
<a href="#Gurak2">Gurak, 
1999</a>), to make information available that may not otherwise be easily 
accessible to community members <a 
href="#Ogan">(Ogan, 1993)</a>, or 
to instigate or support political activities (<a 
href="#Mele">Mele, 1999</a>; <a 
href="#Klein">Klein, 1999</a>). 
Often, such actions are closely related either to the areas of interest of the 
community or to the private lives of its participants. Such activities can range 
from fund-raisers to help with medical expenses or other needs of participants, 
to more politically oriented activities such as letter-writing campaigns or 
word-of-mouth publicity for other types of civic actions (<a 
href="#Rheingold">Rheingold, 
1993</a>; <a 
href="#Gurak1">Gurak, 1997</a>). 
In addition, the use of CMC technologies to support the formation of 
geographically distributed work-groups has been widely documented (<a 
href="#Oravec">Oravec, 1996</a>; 
<a href="#Turoff">Turoff, Hiltz, 
Bieber, Fjermestad, &amp; Rana, 1999</a>; <a 
href="#Acker">Acker, n.d</a>.; <a 
href="#Adams">Adams, Toomey, 
&amp; Churchill, 1999</a>; among many others; see also <a 
href="#Wellman2">Wellman, Salaff, 
&amp; Dimitrova, 1996</a>, for an overview of non-work uses of CMC technologies 
within work-related contexts). Finally, it is a common practice for members of a 
virtual community to develop information resources expressly designed to meet 
the information needs of their own community. For instance, Usenet newsgroups 
typically create Frequently-Asked-Question (FAQ) documents, which outline not 
only behavioural norms, but also provide a great deal of fundamental information 
about the community's area of interest. Another example of community-based 
development of information resources is the summary of responses, through which 
a single community member may take on the task of filtering through extensive 
e-mail responses to a query, summarizing those responses, and presenting them in 
concise form to the community as a whole. In some cases, these efforts can even 
include the creation of full-scale searchable databases to make large stores of 
pertinant information available to the full community at any time. Such efforts, 
whether they seek to enhance the community's information resources or influence 
the world outside of the community, depend upon the ability of the virtual 
community to support active and ongoing exchange of information among its 
participants. </p>

<h2>Conclusion </h2>

<p>From the point of view of the provision and availability of information, the 
primary significance of virtual communities is the fact that they function for 
their members not only as social settings, but as "information neighborhoods," 
contexts within which they can engage in ongoing information sharing activities. 
Participants can come to their communities as they would come to more 
traditional information resources, to make explicit queries with the expectation 
of receiving relevant answers. In addition, they can come to their communities 
knowing that, because other participants share their interests, they are likely 
to be congenial information environments, places where information in which they 
are interested is likely to be found, even if they do not have explicit queries. 
And they can do so in a situation which, while it lacks the face-to-face 
interactions of more traditional communities, provides considerable opportunity 
for socializing and other types of interaction along with the exchange of 
information. </p>

<p>This essay has outlined a proposed typology that can be used to describe the 
ways in which participants in virtual communities behave in terms of their use 
of information and their information seeking activities in those communities. In 
a series of future studies, the typology will be tested against specific virtual 
communities, and revised to reflect the actual behaviours observed. It is 
expected that different communities, in part because of their focus on different 
topics and areas of interest, will differ significantly in terms of the 
behaviours of their participants (c.f. <a 
href="#Baym">Baym, 1995</a>). 
Thus, this typology will provide a mechanism for assessing the characteristics 
of virtual communities in terms of their support for information exchange, and 
has the potential to enhance our understanding of virtual communities as 
information environments. </p>

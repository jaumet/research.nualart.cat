<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The expanding information infrastructure in Europe will increase the demand for high-quality, 
easily accessible and usable information services.  At the same time, in the Information 
Society, there will be an increasing demand for professionals with skills, able to improve their 
potential through life long learning, accessing and using information sources available world-
wide.  Highly qualified information professionals are a crucial asset in any society to enable it 
to reap all the benefits and opportunities created by the Information Market.  In the Less 
Favoured Regions (LFRs) of the European Union there is a shortage of education and training 
opportunities for information professionals to enable them to cope with the rapidly changing 
environment.  It was to address this need for well qualified and trained information 
professionals that the TRAIN-ISS project was funded under the IMPACT 2 programme of the 
Commission of the European Communities</p>.  

<p>The principal objective of TRAIN-ISS was to boost the development of the European 
information market through the enhancement of skills and knowledge available within the 
LFRs of the Community by means of transfer from the more favoured regions.  This was 
achieved by means of a nine-month training programme in various aspects of electronic 
information, with a focus on database design, development and marketing, and on new 
developments in information technology that are likely to have an impact in the future, in 
areas such as telecommunications, multi-media and the Internet.  The programme included a 
one-month placement with an experienced information provider.  The contract for running the 
programme was awarded to the Department of Information Studies, University of Sheffield, 
UK in collaboration with the Centre for Technological Information for Industry of INETI in 
Portugal. </p>

<h2>Design of the course</h2>

<p>The course design developed by the contractors was discussed in a Workshop held at the 
European Commission in Luxembourg at which all the LFR National Focal Points (NFPs, 
these are now referred to as National Awareness Partners) and major information providers 
were represented.  As a result of the Workshop the course underwent further revision and its 
final implementation form was agreed with the Commission.</p>

<p>The participants in the programme had to meet the requirements of the University of Sheffield 
for entry into a Diploma/Masters programme as well as satisfying the requirements of the 
project.  The selection criteria were agreed at the Workshop and were as follows:
Essential: a University degree or equivalent; and a good working knowledge of English, as 
demonstrated by successful completion of the British Council’s ELTS (English Language 
Testing Service) test (or its equivalent) at level 6.0. Desirable: relevant work experience; knowledge of, or aptitude for, information service provision; keyboard and basic computing skills, e.g., word processing; and funding in addition to the subsistence allowance paid from the TRAIN-ISS budget.</p>

<p>The NFPs in the LFRs were responsible for preparing lists of candidates based on the criteria  
and interviews.  These lists were used by the contractors to draw up a list of candidates for 
approval by the Commission.  Eight students from Greece, two from Italy, six from Spain, 
seven from Portugal, six from the eastern Länder of Germany and three from Eire participated 
in the programme.  The NFPs also administered a Previous Knowledge Questionnaire 
developed by the contractors, which was used in assessing the knowledge gain of the students, 
when it was re-administered at the end of the course.</p>

<h2>The programme </h2>

<p>The programme consisted of three periods:</p>

<ol>
<li>The taught Diploma period - two semesters.</li>
<li>The placement period - one month.</li>
<li>Transfer to MSc status - one year to complete.</li>
</ol>

<h3>The taught Diploma period</h3>

<p>Teaching was carried out by lecturers from the Department of Information Studies, plus a 
number of visiting lecturers including staff from INETI/CITI.  Emphasis was placed on 
practical issues through examples and case studies.</p>

<h3>The curriculum </h3>

<p>The diploma covered the following areas.</p>

<ol>
<li>European Information Policies</li>
<ul>
<li>Information market and information technologies</li>
<li>		Information society and economy</li>
<li>		European economic area</li>
</ul>
<li>Database design and development</li>
<ul>
<li>Technical aspects</li>
<li>	Managerial aspects (marketing information services, costs of database creation, 
	cost of running an information service, business plans and budgeting for information services, etc. )</li>
</ul>
<li>User training and documentation</li>
	<ul>
<li>Interpersonal skills</li>
<li>	User needs identification</li>
<li>	Documenting systems and services</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<p>Emphasis was placed on understanding the applications of information technology through 
laboratory-based teaching in the Department’s networked micro-computer laboratory.</p>

<h3>Student assessment </h3>

<p>The course assessment was based on seven pieces of coursework and two written 
examinations.  In order to satisfy the requirements set out by the University of Sheffield for 
the Diploma in Electronic Information Management, the students were required to achieve an 
overall final grade of eight or more on a 16 point marking scale.</p>  

<h3>Student support and programme evaluation</h3>

<p>Each student was assigned a personal tutor to whom any  problems could be directed.  In 
addition students could contact any member of staff to discuss a particular problem. For some 
of the coursework, groups of students were allocated to staff members who provided 
guidance.  The students elected two course representatives who attended the  meetings of the 
Staff Student Committee and the Teaching Committee thus giving an opportunity to discuss 
more general issues about the programme.</p>  

<p>Programme review meetings were held at the end of each semester and  the students were 
asked to complete evaluation questionnaires. The majority of students found the work load in 
Semester One to be about right. Most of the material presented was of interest to the students.   
The majority of the students found the material presented in the second semester interesting 
but they felt they had too much work to do.  </p>  

<h3>The placement</h3>

<p>Twenty companies in six European countries participated in the programme by taking at least 
one student on the one-month work experience placement.  The placements were evaluated by 
the students as very successful:  a number remarked on the confidence it had given them that 
they could contribute usefully in an organisation, as well as on the fact that the skills they had 
acquired had indeed proved to be useful.  Many of the placement host organisations 
commented  favourably on the students and two later offered employment to their students.  
One student used his placement report to secure employment in Greece and another 
established herself as an independent consultant developing World-Wide Web pages, a task 
she had done  during her placement.</p>   

<h2>The MSc in Electronic Information Management</h2>

<p>Although outside the requirements of the project, it was decided that the Department of 
Information Studies would offer the students who reached a minimum average score of ten the 
opportunity to work towards a Masters degree in Electronic Information Management by 
means of a small-scale research project resulting in a dissertation.  All the students reached 
this level and all opted to proceed to the degree. </p> 

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>The successful implementation of the Diploma/MSc in Electronic Information Management 
course at Sheffield has proved the feasibility of running a European Masters programme.   
There are also clear indications of the benefits of such a programme to the European Union 
and the LFRs in terms of  the information, knowledge and skills transfer which occurred as 
the participants returned to their home countries.  The benefits to the participants themselves 
are also clear: knowledge and skills gain; increased confidence; a network of contacts in other 
LFRs and also in the more favoured regions; and offers of employment for some.  In 
completing the TRAIN-ISS project the contractors  themselves have learned many lessons of 
value in the design and implementation of European and other Masters programmes.  In 
Sheffield, aspects of this programme will be incorporated into the existing MSc in 
Information Management programme which is currently undergoing one of its regular, and 
major, periodic reviews.</p>

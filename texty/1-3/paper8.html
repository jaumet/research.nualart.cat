<h2>Introduction </h2>
<p>
<p>This paper describes a current research project in the Department of Information Studies at the 
University of Sheffield.  With funding from the British Library Research and Development 
Department a critical success factors-based investigation of the management information 
needs of academic Heads of Department in an number of English universities was undertaken 
in 1994/1995, following publication of the results of  a pilot study by <a href="#pel">Pellow and Wilson</a> (1993).</a></p>
  
<p>Senior academic staff, university administrators and librarians in sixteen universities were 
interviewed between December, 1994 and March, 1995.  Collation of data and analysis of  
results have been completed; the final report on the project is currently being edited.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
<p>Changing patterns of university financing and management strategies and practices have 
obliged academic Heads of  Departments in higher education institutions to assume greater 
responsibility for both human resource management and traditional academic matters.  At the 
same time, university libraries are having to come to terms with alternatives to traditional 
resource procurement and deployment methods and, in some instances, have begun to devolve 
responsibilities for decision-making on some aspects of budget allocation and expenditure and 
prioritisation to academic departments.  New teaching and learning strategies on the one hand 
and, on the other, an increasingly competitive environment for student recruitment and 
research funding, have accentuated the need for more sophisticated "intelligence" services 
about potential markets, competitors, sources of support and technological and other 
developments.  Detailed information about and analysis of competing units, funding agencies 
and opportunities, the identification and profiling of important decision-makers, external 
assessors and the preparation of briefings on topics of special interest or current interest to the 
individual university are further aspects of the "intelligence" service increasingly seen as vital 
to the success of  both the university as an institution and its constituent parts.  
<p>
<p>As indicated by <a href="#all">Allen</a> (1995: 12) this combination of factors, together with the HEFCs’ change of emphasis from information technology strategies to information systems and information 
strategies, has focused attention on the need for institutions to "plan strategically for the 
gathering, storage and dissemination of their information resources".  The problems some 
universities have experienced in implementing and running management information systems 
may, at least in part, be attributable to insufficient consideration of what managers in 
universities actually require from such systems.  Sometimes, information requirements may 
not be considered at an early enough stage in the development process, little attention may be 
paid to information that is "external", qualitative or subjective, and solutions to problems may 
often be technology-led rather than information-led.
<p>
<h2>The Critical Success Factors Approach</h2>

<p>
<p>One possible solution to the problems referred to above has been suggested by <a href="#roc">Rockart</a>(1979: 85), namely that a critical success factors (CSF) analysis may be beneficial in identifying 
"the limited number of areas in which results, if they are satisfactory, will insure successful 
competitive performance for the organisation".  These key areas of activity - usually three to 
six factors - would need careful and consistent attention from management if organisational 
goals were to be attained.  By concentrating on the factors that were vital if a company were 
to meet its objectives Rockart demonstrated that a CSF approach could be used to identify 
managers’ information needs and thereby give direction to the development of any computer-
based information system.  The identification of CSFs can help to clarify the amount and 
nature of information that must be assembled and permits an organisation to concentrate its 
efforts on meeting its needs rather on what the available technology will allow.  The CSF 
methodology enables concentration on a core set of issues and their refinement in a way that 
permits the design of an information system to be examined iteratively for validity and 
completeness.
<p>
<p>The CSF methodology has shown itself to be an attractive methodology for analysing overall 
organisational information needs in widely different environments; it has been used, for 
example, to examine strategic planning at British Rail (<a href="#mai">Mainelli & Miller</a>, 1988), and information centre managers (<a href="#mog">Mogal</a>, 1988).  It has also been used in higher education, as <a href="#pel">Pellow & Wilson </a>(1993) indicate; more recently, <a href="#sab">Sabherwal & Kirs</a> (1994), in a study of 244 large academic institutions, have shown  
that aligning CSFs to information technology capability can improve the overall performance 
of an institution.  The fact, however, that most examples of applications of a CSFs approach 
have tended to be focused on commercial organisations raises questions about, for example,  
the validity and value of applying what has been essentially a commercial approach to a type 
of organisation, such as a university, that has usually been regarded as adding value to its 
customers rather than generating profit for itself or its shareholders, the difficulty of 
identifying organisational goals in a university and the appropriateness of a CSFs approach 
for all levels of manager.  <a href="#boy">Boynton and Smud</a> (1990: 24), for example, felt that the Head of a 
careers placement service within a university responded well to the CSF factor but found that 
lower level managers found the method difficult since they 
	<blockquote>"...tended to react to day-to-day events within their individual responsibilities, rather 
than to adopt a more proactive, conceptual orientation to their and their organisation’s 
working environment.  This suggests that the managers who do not approach their 
responsibilities from a planning mode may find the CSF method frustrating."</blockquote>

<p>The pilot study by <a href="#pel">Pellow and Wilson</a> (1993) and the research project described here attempt to 
address these questions.  In particular, the current project is concerned with examining the 
extent to which senior academic and administrative staff can identify organisational goals and 
the factors critical to their achievement and with determining the relevance and effectiveness 
of a CSF-based approach to their identification.
<p>
<h2>The Pilot Study</h2>
<p>
While the research project described by <a href="#all">Allen</a> (1995) is primarily concerned with Information Systems Strategy (ISS) formation in British higher education institutions the research project 
described in this paper is more narrowly concerned with the specific management information 
needs of senior academic staff and the extent to which these needs are or can be met by other 
units or sections within universities, and with their responses to the CSF approach.  The one-
year project developed from a pilot study conducted within the University of Sheffield for a 
steering group which was examining how more effective management information systems 
might be developed in the University (<a href="#pel">Pellow & Wilson</a>, 1993).  That pilot study attempted to identify and define the management information requirements of  twenty academic Heads of  Department in areas critical to the achievement of organisational goals and to explore the relationship between such critical success factors (CSFs) and information needs.  Those Heads interviewed were 
able to identify their organisational goals, critical success factors and information needs and 
ranked the improvement of research performance and provision of high quality teaching as 
their most important goals and,  as critical success factors,  they identified "external" factors 
such as availability of funding for research and students, response to external needs and the 
policy of external bodies and "internal" factors such as resource management, course design, 
student recruitment, exploitation of new technology and teaching and research expertise as 
important in servicing their organisational goals.  The study confirmed that Heads had a wide 
range of information needs, including competitor intelligence, research funding alternatives 
and opportunities, potential student needs and student employment needs and the performance 
and marketing of new courses.  
<p>
<p>The results of the pilot study suggested that a more extensive examination of CSFs and related 
information needs would be likely  to provide the University with a better idea of the 
information it needed in order to support its wider goals and to improve communications 
between departments and the centre, especially about the overall direction of University 
policy, as well as to improve the implementation of and support given to University policy-
making (<a href="#pel">Pellow & Wilson</a>, 1993: 435-436).
<p>
<h2>The Current Project</h2>
<p>
<p>In view of the findings of the pilot study it was decided to undertake a much more extensive 
investigation of Heads of Department and to extend the coverage of the survey by including 
university librarians, senior administrators such as registrars and academic secretaries, 
industrial liaison officers, finance officers, and management information officers. It was 
believed that the findings of the investigation might lead to:
<ul>
<li>a better understanding of the range of management information needs of academic departments in universities:
<li>a clearer picture of the present and possible future role of university libraries in the development of campus-wide information systems;
<li>a clearer perception of the role (if any) which university libraries currently play or might play in meeting the management information needs of academic departments;
<li>an enlargement of university administrators’ understanding of the management information needs of senior academic staff, of critical success factors and the administrative and managerial services necessary to ensure their achievement.
</ul>
 <p>

<h3>Universities surveyed</h3>
<p>
<p>Following the collection and analysis of data from a number of sources, including HEFCs, the 
Department for Education (as it then was) and the universities themselves, it was decided to 
confine the project to a stratified sample of 16 universities in England, based on size, age, 
status, subject mix and geographical location and ordered according to <a href="#sum">Sumsion’s</a> (1994) typology.  This provided a good geographical spread and ranged institutions into one "large", three 
"pre-Robbins", three "post-Robbins" and nine post-1992 institutions (Table 1).
<p></p>

<p>Information was gathered on the numbers of undergraduate and postgraduate students and 
their mix in all departments in each institution in order, as in the pilot study, to distinguish 
between departments on the basis of the proportion of undergraduates.  Within universities 
departments were also chosen on the basis of their rating in the latest Research Assessment 
Exercise (Table 2) and to reflect the range of disciplines found in the universities (Table 3).

<p>
In all, forty-four Heads of department were interviewed; these were fairly evenly divided 
between the former polytechnics sector (24 interviews) and "older" universities (20 
interviews) 
<p>
<h3>University librarians and administrators</h3>

<p>In addition to those with academic Heads of Department interviews were held with the chief 
librarians of 15 of the universities and with the deputy librarian of the remaining one.  
Interviews were also held with 19 senior managers and administrators: two Registrars and 
Secretaries, one Secretary of a medical faculty, three finance officers, five administrators with 
management information responsibilities, three Heads of industrial liaison offices (including 
research funding administrators and EU officers), two Heads of student services, one Head of 
a careers information service, one Head of a marketing and PR office and one Head of a 
science park. </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Information retrieval (IR) is about matching human information needs to data 
objects. Rich structural markup of documents will enable a next generation of IR 
systems to better meet the information needs of people because the markup will 
help to disambiguate the language used for the documents (<a href="#new00">Newby, 2000</a>). Metadata 
will further enhance the capabilities of IR systems by providing high quality 
descriptions of content.</p>

<p>This work suggests that the Semantic Web, by supporting metadata and enhanced 
relations among data from disparate sources, will facilitate information 
retrieval. There are several ways the Semantic Web will improve IR, and at least 
one will require advanced techniques for the envisioned benefits to be realized. 
Below, these potential improvements the Semantic Web offers IR will be examined, 
and proposals for addressing the difficult components will be introduced.</p>

<p>The framework for this analysis is the concept of information space. 
Information space is defined as the set of concepts and relations among held by 
an information system. This is as compared to cognitive space, which is the set 
of concepts and relations among them held by a human (see <a href="#new01">Newby, 2001</a> for 
further detail). For IR, it has been argued that a long-term goal is for IR 
systems to act as extensions to human memory (also known as, exosomatic memory systems; 
introduced in <a href="#bro80">Brookes, 1980</a>). Were such systems to exist, finding information 
would be the same as remembering information already known. For this long-term 
goal to be realized, information spaces of IR systems would need to be tightly 
coupled to the cognitive spaces of their individual users. </p>

<p>The Semantic Web will help us take steps towards the goal of IR systems' 
information spaces matching their human users' cognitive spaces. These steps 
will be accomplished by adding further specificity to the description of data 
items on the Web, and providing a deeper context for their understanding, as 
discussed below. The particular influence of the Semantic Web on IR that will be 
explored here is the merging of or translating between information spaces.</p>

<p>Before considering the merging of information spaces, let us consider human 
communication. From a simplified point of view, we can consider the act of human 
communication as getting a message, which has a particular cognitive 
understanding for the sending human, to a receiver. If communication is 
successful, not just the utterances of the message will be sent, but also the 
meaning. That is, for human communication to be successful, there must be a 
mapping between the sender's and receiver's cognitive spaces in which the shared 
message exists. This approach to human communication mirrors everyday 
experience, in which people must lay a context and achieve mutual understanding 
(that is, sharing or mapping between cognitive spaces) in order to exchange 
messages. In a classroom environment, for example, the instructor might spend 
hours or even weeks to lay out the necessary background required to understand a 
particular message. Without that background, which created the shared cognitive 
space for the students and instructor, the message would have little or no 
meaning or, worse, be misinterpreted.</p>

<p>The pertinence to IR systems' information spaces is that, as for human 
communication, an utterance or document cannot be effectively understood or 
exchanged without some shared information space. This challenge is exacerbated 
by the Semantic Web, in which markup and metadata will allow for shorter and 
more precise documents or document fragments, perhaps without the larger context 
of full text.</p>

<p>Consider these document fragments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The annual cost is $470 per participant. 
  <li>Subject = farm animals. 
  <li>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal. 
  </li></ul>
  
<p>The Semantic Web will allow such fragments to greatly increase the utility of 
IR systems by adding specificity to statements of information need (that is, 
human queries). Queries might include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What were last year's expenditures for our staff retreat? 
  <li>How shall we base our pricing strategy for membership in our trade group 
  this year? 
  <li>Find documents about genetically engineered organisms 
  <li>What are some concerns of animal rights groups? 
  <li>Early examples of misogyny in the US 
  <li>The use of an adjective when an adverb is indicated </li></ul>
  
<p>In these examples, queries are envisioned as matching documents or document 
fragments based on the topic or concept of the query and document, in addition 
to the words themselves. This is a critical distinction between the popular Web 
search engines of today and Semantic Web-enabled IR systems of the future. In 
the future, we would like to gain a match between the information need and the 
actual content of a document, rather than simply the words of a query and the 
words of a document.</p>

<p>While word matching is not to be discarded — after all, it has been 
demonstrably functional for many years, in many IR systems — we would like to 
move towards exosomatic memory. Exosomatic memory clearly requires concept 
matching and the merger of human cognitive space with IR systems' information 
spaces. In the following sections, the steps that the Semantic Web will enable 
towards enhancements in IR are explored.</p>

<p>In the next section, the role of the Semantic Web for providing specificity 
for IR is addressed. The following three sections address IR techniques enabled 
by the Semantic Web: direct mapping techniques, rule-based techniques, and 
context-derived techniques. A concluding section lays out the research programme 
for improving IR via the Semantic Web, and identifies remaining challenges to be 
addressed.</p>

<p>Throughout, the emphasis will be on the matching of human information needs 
with documents or document fragments in text environments. The text considered 
is semi-structured, such as that found in human-generated documents of all 
types: journal articles, news, literature, etc. In such semi-structured 
documents, we can identify components (such as headings, tabular data, 
references, etc.), but there is considerable latitude in the actual wording and 
formatting used in them. Information filtering, sub-document identification and 
similar approaches to information retrieval are possible beneficiaries of the 
approaches described here. There will be little attention paid to highly 
structured data (databases), numeric data and non-text, although we anticipate 
the conceptual framework used here will apply to other data types as well.</p>

<h2>The Semantic Web: specificity for information retrieval</h2>

<p>The Semantic Web provides specific interpretations for data items contained 
within documents. This will help greatly with resolving some of the ambiguity in 
human language. Whereas in typical IR, systems use statistical information about 
patterns of term occurrence in documents to determine the best matches for a 
query, the Semantic Web will help to narrow the sphere of candidate document 
matches considerably.</p>

<p>Consider, as an example, a human using a modern-day Web search engine to seek 
information about pet care. She might type a few words as a query: &quot;dog care and 
feeding.&quot;</p>

<p>Typical information retrieval systems (which include contemporary Web search 
engines) proceed to find the best matching documents by looking at the term 
frequency of each of the query terms (likely dropping &quot;and&quot; as being 
irrelevant). From all the documents the IR system knows about, the possible 
candidate set would be the Boolean intersection (or union, if an &quot;OR&quot; query is 
specified) of documents containing the query terms. In practice, there are 
various short cuts so that not every possible document needs to be examined, but 
conceptually the set of possible documents to present to the user is limited by 
the query from ALL documents to only those that contain all of the query 
terms.</p>

<p>For a large and diverse data set as the Web, the candidate set for most 
queries of a few words will be very large. To rank the &quot;best&quot; documents matching 
the query, numeric term weights are assigned to the query terms, and to their 
roles in each of the candidate documents. Other factors, including the length of 
each document and global statistics (such as the average length of a document in 
the collection) are considered. Many further factors may be included: the 
authority of a Web page, the number of incoming and outgoing links to the page, 
the presence of query terms in headings or meta tags, and so forth. Each of 
these weights must be combined somehow to yield a numeric score for each 
candidate document. The top-ranked candidates are then presented to the 
information seeker.</p>

<p>The main thing missing from this IR scenario, which is played out millions of 
times each day on Web search engines, commercial IR systems and elsewhere, is 
understanding of the query. Based on the query above, different Web search 
engines yield a variety of matches in the list of highly-ranked &quot;hits:&quot;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information for mushers on the Iditarod trail 
  <li>Pet store supplies 
  <li>Taking care of your new puppy 
  <li>Care for particular breeds (Pyrenees, pug and others) 
  <li>Holistic pet care 
  <li>Dog walking services </li></ul>

<p>There are also documents that are clearly not good matches, but were 
retrieved nevertheless:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Care and feeding of the press 
  <li>What to do if you find a wild dog 
  <li>Orphaned baby bunnies 
  <li>Dog interaction with iguanas </li></ul>
  
<p>(Query tested in May 2002 against Google, Lycos, Altavista, Yahoo! and Excite 
search engines, all of the above were from the top-10 hits). The point here is 
not to illustrate imperfections in Web search engines. Rather, it is to consider 
what the Semantic Web could do to improve results.</p>

<p>If our information seeker was interested particularly in seeking a document 
containing vet's advice on what brand of food to purchase, the Semantic Web 
would help. A modified query might have content such as this:</p>

<blockquote><i>Topic: dog food<br>Document type: advice<br>Document 
  author-type: veterinarian</i> </blockquote>

  
<p>Although an experienced searcher might be able to add some of this additional 
specificity to a query for modern search engines, this would not change 
fundamental type of matching. Contemporary search engines offer no facility for 
metadata concepts enabled by RDF in the Semantic Web. Let us consider a simple 
case that would yield far superior results, and then turn to the challenges of 
the Semantic Web for IR.</p>

<p>In the simplest case, the Semantic Web will let IR systems generate a 
candidate set of documents from all those known based on exact and unambiguous 
criteria. The exact mechanisms for describing documents semantically for the Web 
are still under development, but the intention is clear: to develop &quot;languages 
for expressing information in a machine processable form&quot; (<a href="#ber98">Berners-Lee, 1998</a>). 
The languages are based on schema, document type definitions (DTDs) and the 
like, and the resource description framework (RDF, see <a 
href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">http://www.w3.org/RDF/</a>), provides the ontology 
used for metadata communication.</p>

<p>The modified query, above, would eliminate all documents from the candidate 
set that were not authored by vets, or did not contain advice, or were not about 
dog food. The resulting set of candidate documents would be ranked using 
standard techniques above. Alternatively, the information seeker might be 
presented with other available sorting mechanisms such as last update, location 
of the author, and so forth. </p>

<p>The Semantic Web will also provide for segmenting of the document collection, 
as well as for inheritance of attributes. Thus, one algebra for the query might 
be to consider each possible document in an IR systems collection, as described 
above. Another might first generate a sub-set of all pages that are part of a 
document tree authored by a veterinarian or veterinary agency, and then seek for 
the desired topic within that set.</p>

<p>This example demonstrates the potential power of the Semantic Web for IR. By 
providing for further specification of an information need, using the ontology 
and data description language(s) the Semantic Web provides, a much narrower and 
more appropriate set of candidate documents may be generated. </p>

<p>So, what's the problem? Will the Semantic Web be a panacea for IR? Not 
necessarily. There are at least two critical challenges to be considered:</p>

<ol type=1>
  <li>Human language is highly varied. Thus, we will be left with the need for 
  sophisticated IR techniques to determine the documents that are the best match 
  for an information need; 
  <li>There will be a large number of different implementations of schema/DTDs, 
  ontologies, and vocabularies used on the Semantic Web to described documents. 
  Thus, determining how to generate the list of candidates from a specific 
  query, such as that given above, is itself an IR problem requiring mapping 
  between information spaces. </li>
  </ol>

  
<p>The rest of this work focuses on the second point. In order to reap the 
benefit the Semantic Web offers IR, it is necessary to map between the 
information spaces of different sets of documents (held by different information 
systems — Web servers, database servers, etc.) in order to identify which 
documents actually meet a set of information need criteria.</p>

<p>If one document author utilizes &quot;Document author-type&quot; while another utilizes 
&quot;Personal author,&quot; can our IR system identify that they each refer to a 
criterion we are interested in for our query (and, in fact, do they)? If one 
author inserts &quot;dog food&quot; in the &quot;Topic&quot; meta tag, and another author inserts 

&quot;canine nutrition,&quot; how will an IR system determine whether to include these 
documents in the candidate set?</p>

<p>In the sections below, three approaches to addressing the issue of ambiguity 
in the implementation of Semantic Web metadata description and structure for IR 
are discussed. With direct mapping, we use a dictionary or look-up table to 
determine which elements match exactly some other elements. With rule-based 
mapping, we follow a set of procedures, possibly involving data transformation, 
to identify comparable data. Finally, when we have no such dictionaries or 
rules, we must rely on the context of the document itself to determine matching 
or transformation processes.</p>

<h2>Direct mapping of information spaces</h2>

<p>The full benefit of the Semantic Web for IR will be available when the data 
organization and metadata standards enable direct mapping between information 
spaces for different data sources. For example, if datasets containing 
bibliographic records employ an &quot;author&quot; field to refer to the author's name for 
US-based data, but &quot;contributor&quot; for UK-based data, it is a simple matter to 
perform a query that matches both.</p>

<p>Such a query might be expressed or interpreted as:</p>

<blockquote><i>If (source.location = '.uk') query(contributor="joyce, 
  james")<br>else query(author="joyce, james")</i> </blockquote>
  
<p>On the Semantic Web, it is reasonable to anticipate considerable efforts will 
be made to enable such mapping. Indeed, this scenario provides the closest 
match, in an IR scenario, to the goals expressed by the Semantic Web working 
groups and publications. (We note that, for this example, the Dublin Core 
elements, <a 
href="http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements">http://purl.org/metadata/dublin_core_elements</a>, 
nicely solve the problem by specifying a common label, &quot;Creator.&quot; Yet we 
envision many situations when similar data will not use the same metadata 
elements.)</p>

<p>Metadata schema registries will enable people to publish their data using 
their own schema (or one derived from another) and to specify how it relates to 
the data organization of other schema. This is important, and will be quite 
beneficial for IR. See Heery &amp; Wagner (<a href="#hee02">2002</a>) for a discussion of metadata 
schema registries. For any pair of schema, a lookup table can provide the 
equivalent data type, tag, entity class, etc. to map between the two schema. 
Within a registry, then, any possible pair that map onto each other (even if the 
match applies to only part of the schema) may be quickly looked up by the IR 
system.</p>

<p>The problem remains, though, for schema that are not specified in registries 
or, worse, that use comparable tags but for different data types or items. The 
following sections offer alternative approaches for when a simple direct mapping 
between information spaces is unavailable.</p>

<h2>Rule-based mapping of information spaces</h2>

<p>On the modern Web, and anticipated for the Semantic Web, are many documents 
which are comparable to other documents in structure and content yet have 
important differences. For this section, consider the example of a directory of 
addresses, membership, or customers. One Web site might list personnel in an 
academic department along with telephone numbers and research areas. Another Web 
site might list some of its premier customers along with the products they 
purchased and their area of business. Yet another might list accounts 
receivable.</p>

<p>In each of these three datasets, a record might exist of the form:</p>

<table align=center>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>John Young</tt></td>
    <td><tt>||</tt></td>
    <td><tt>222-3456</tt></td>
    <td><tt>||</tt></td>

    <td><tt>information retrieval systems and 
services</tt></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>On the modern Web, each data entry might occur in an HTML table and for IR 
purposes we would be hard-pressed to determine whether &quot;John Young&quot; were a 
person, a business, an employee or even a product. Similarly, 222-3456 could be 
anything from a telephone number to an invoice number.</p>

<p>The Semantic Web (as implemented through RDF, XML and other markup schemes 
more sophisticated than HTML) offers the ability to be specific. For the first 
column of entries, a label &quot;Name&quot; or &quot;Personal Name&quot; or &quot;Faculty Name&quot; could 
make the data unambiguous and enable the sort of IR process envisioned in the 
previous section. Labels such as &quot;Telephone&quot; for the second and &quot;Research 
interests&quot; for the third would help greatly.</p>

<p>For our IR systems on the Semantic Web, inheritance will play a critical 
role. Imagine the first column is labeled (or each datum is labeled), &quot;Name,&quot; 
e.g., &quot;Name=John Young.&quot; Alone, this is nearly as bad as having no descriptive 
label at all! Is it the name of a company, or a customer, or departmental 
personnel, or something else? If inheritance is available, however, other clues 
in the schema might help. Inheritance would be helpful for direct mapping 
(above) and context-derived mapping (below), although those sections describe 
techniques that would work in the absence of inheritance.</p>

<p>Abbreviated RDF syntax for a document containing the sample data above might

<p>Does this help? In itself, it helps: we now see that 222-3456 is a phone 
number, and might glean other revelations. But combined with the data referenced 
by the document (in this case, the &quot;ex&quot; XML namespace linking to the company Web 
site), we envision that significantly more data about the document contents will 
be available through inheritance.</p>

<p>For IR, we would require a list of rules — not a simple mapping between 
elements — to determine which documents should be candidates for an information 
need. To harvest a competitor's customer list, for example, a query would 
specify names of individuals or organizations that list the competitor as a 
supplier. To build the list of candidate documents:</p>

<blockquote><i>Select a document for candidacy if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;It contains a 
  list of products<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;AND The list includes our company 
</i></blockquote>

<p>From our example in the previous section, we could use a similar strategy to 
identify that a document contains names (of some sort), then use keyword 
matching on the &quot;interestArea&quot; tags' content to identify faculty with interests 
in a particular area such as the semantic Web:</p>

<blockquote><i>Select a document for candidacy if<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;It contains a 
  list of interest areas<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;AND terms &quot;semantic&quot; and &quot;web&quot; occur in 
  the interest area<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;AND interest areas are associated with a 
  name</i> </blockquote>
  
<p>For each document under consideration, our IR system would need to examine 
the document plus documents from which its properties are drawn to determine 
whether it should be a candidate. For a well-known domain, with an available set 
of metadata standards and schema, pattern matching rules will allow this to 
happen. For less well-known domains, the information seeker might need to author 
his own rules. In both cases, the Semantic Web enables this type of rule-based 
approach, while the modern Web does not.</p>

<h2>Context-derived mapping of information spaces</h2>

<p>As stated above, the challenge of IR is largely due to the ambiguity of human 
language. On the Semantic Web, the ability of document authors to choose or 
create a data organization scheme they believe appropriate creates the same sort 
of ambiguity. One author might use &quot;Name&quot; while another employs &quot;PersonalName&quot; 
and a third utilizes &quot;fullName.&quot; If the author draws from existing schema, or 
registers her schema centrally, we may be able to map to other schema or form 
rules for understanding how her data are related to other data.</p>

<p>In this section, we consider IR approaches that might function in the absence 
of such additional sources for understanding the content in a document or 
document set. These approaches should be particular useful during the coming 
years as the Semantic Web's many standards continue to emerge.</p>

<p>Our general goal, in this situation, is to learn about the structure and 
content types of documents from the documents themselves. This is not unlike the 
need in IR to use statistics about term frequency within and across documents to 
understand relations among terms and documents. In fact, this is the basis of 
the approaches we suggest: to derive understanding of the information space and 
its relation to other information spaces through the context of the documents 
themselves.</p>

<p>Given our personnel directory sample above, the single record was ambiguous. 
Add a few more records, however, and things become clearer:</p>

<table align=center>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>John Young</tt></td>
    <td><tt>||</tt></td>

    <td><tt>222-3456</tt></td>
    <td><tt>||</tt></td>
    <td><tt>information retrieval systems and services</tt></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>Harold Ramus</tt></td>
    <td><tt>||</tt></td>

    <td><tt>222-9077</tt></td>
    <td><tt>||</tt></td>

  <tr>
    <td><tt>Sue Zimmer</tt></td>
    <td><tt>||</tt></td>

    <td><tt>232-1002</tt></td>
    <td><tt>||</tt></td>
    <td><tt>management of information agencies</tt></td></tr></tbody></table>
	
<p>While the numbers remain ambiguous, the first column is starting to look very 
much like human names, rather than companies or accounts. This human impression 
would be supported by a system with wider contextual data — for example, a phone 
book that lists the same personal names. The third column might closely match 
faculty interests in another academic department for which we have more complete 
metadata (and perhaps with clear labeling of phone numbers). While the structure 
of such a document might be helpful in eliminating possible interpretations of 
the content (i.e., this doesn't appear to be a recipe dataset), structure alone 
doesn't tell us whether the first column deals with individuals, organizations, 
or some other entity.</p>

<p>Rather, the context — especially with the benefit of other documents from 
other sources — provides a sound notion of what the data are about. This is the 
&quot;fuzzy matching&quot; that Tim Berners-Lee suggested will be necessary for traversing 
the Semantic Web.</p>

<p>IR techniques for fuzzy matching typically involve less reliance on 
individual query terms, instead they expand the query to incorporate synonyms 
and, for XML-formatted data, they could look at the general document structure 
(i.e., tables versus lists; headings versus paragraphs). To illustrate, we will 
take the information space (IS) retrieval method used by the author (<a href="#new98">Newby, 1998</a>). </p>

<p>The IS retrieval technique is closely related to latent semantic indexing 
(LSI, see <a href="#dee90">Deerwester, <em>et al.</em>, 1990</a>). The premise is that terms that tend to 
co-occur similarly with other terms are related; terms with less similar 
co-occurrence patterns are less strongly related. For example, the terms pig, 
swine, boar and hog might be anticipated to co-occur with similar patterns 
across a dataset dealing with barnyard animals. </p>

<p>As described extensively in Newby (<a href="#new01">2001</a>), a term-by-term co-occurrence matrix 
is built for an entire dataset. This matrix is sparse, because the majority of 
terms do not occur together in any document. From the co-occurrence matrix, 
which contains raw co-occurrence scores, we build a correlation matrix. In the 
correlation matrix, the pattern of co-occurrence scores for each pair of terms 

is identified and normalized (the matrix is therefore dense, although many 
values are close to zero). The eigensystem for the correlation matrix is 
determined, which produces approximate (fuzzy) relations among terms when we 
only keep a relatively small number of the resulting eigenvectors. A further 
step for IS, not found in LSI, is to re-insert the terms based on their original 
co-occurrence scores scaled by the eigenvalues. The steps described here are 
also known as Principal Components Analysis (PCA).</p>

<p>The benefit of LSI and IS over other many approaches to IR is that all terms 
(and by extension, all documents containing those terms) have a measured 
relation to all other terms in the dataset. This is in contrast to most other 
approaches, which instead treat terms are unrelated to all other terms. For 
general purpose Web retrieval, LSI and IS can be too costly in computational 
resources and storage for the resulting large coordinate systems — and, 
furthermore, might give the casual information seeker a surprise if top-ranked 
documents do not contain all query terms. </p>

<p>For the purpose described here, though, LSI and IS offer considerable 
promise. For a given document of unclear structure and with an unknown schema, 
this fuzzy matching technique could find similar documents. Similarity, in this 
case, would be based on the set of documents that went into the IS computation, 
optimized and trained to make distinctions useful to a particular information 
seeker or in a particular information domain.</p>

<p>The author of this work is investigating application of the IS technique to 
general-purpose document filtering and retrieval on the Web. The prospect is to 
have several prototype documents, and then retrieve newly found documents that 
are similar in topic to the prototype. With the IS technique, the formation of 
Boolean candidate sets is bypassed in favor of a more exhaustive fuzzy match. </p>

<p>On the Semantic Web, context-derived information space matching will be a 
necessity for success until the day when all schema are well-known and all 
documents are standards-compliant. Even when that day arrives (if it ever does), 
there will be ambiguity in the data contained in these documents. As Berners-Lee 
(<a href="#ber98">1998</a>) stated, &quot;toleration of inconsistency can only be done by fuzzy 
systems.&quot;</p>

<p>In searching literature related to this required fuzzy matching for the 
Semantic Web, scarce few solutions to this challenge were found, and none which 
seemed to be a good solution for IR. LSI, IS and related techniques offer 
reasonable promise for mapping between information spaces based on the context 
of those spaces.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We desire IR systems that go beyond plain word matches. We want to match on 
the structure, data type and organization of documents as well. The Semantic Web 
offers these possibilities, and more. When fully realized, the Semantic Web will 
make many IR tasks similar to database tasks: the equivalent of table lookups 
for well-defined and clearly typed data. </p>

<p>While the Semantic Web is under development, however, IR will require 
additional techniques in order to match information needs to documents or 
sub-documents. Rule-based techniques will enable mapping between the information 
spaces of different documents or document sets based on knowledge about those 
documents or inherited from other documents. Such rules may be codified by IR 
system designers for common information needs, or they might be generated 
algorithmically. In some cases, rules may be specified by the information seeker 
himself.</p>

<p>Context-derived techniques for mapping between information spaces are a 
likely need for the Web of today and the Semantic Web of the near future. When 
the data themselves are ambiguous, or the schema or metadata are ambiguous or 
poorly typed, or when a query is expansive (such as a set of sample documents to 
be matched against) rather than narrow (a few terms), context-derived techniques 
will help.</p>

<p>As rephrased here, the whole point of the Semantic Web is to facilitate human 
communication as augmented by networked machines. In order for the contents of 
information spaces held by these machines (Web servers, database servers, etc.) 
to be usefully matched to human information needs, IR systems are needed to 
easily map between the information spaces. This mapping, on the Semantic Web, 
will consist of identifying elements, data types, topics and so forth from one 
set of documents that have desired features in common with another set.</p>

<p>The Semantic Web offers unprecedented power for information retrieval, yet at 
a cost. In order to realize the promise of added structure and understanding of 
document content, IR systems will be required to map between disparate 
information spaces. In the modern Web retrieval environment of simple queries 
and billions of documents, casual information seekers are seldom aware of their 
inability to express complex queries specifying, for example, particular types 
of data, particular relations among data elements, and particular relations to 
other documents. The Semantic Web will enable this complexity, and more. </p>

<p>Without techniques for mapping between information spaces, we are left with 
poor alternatives. Either our IR systems will only consider those documents for 
which our understanding is complete (thus eliminating many possibly useful 
documents), or our systems will forego the benefits of the Semantic Web and rely 
instead on simple word matching. Neither is attractive, so information space 
mapping techniques would appear to be a necessary area for inquiry in order to 
facilitate IR on the Semantic Web.</p>

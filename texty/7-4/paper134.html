<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Internet and the World Wide Web have brought a revolution to information technology and
the daily lives of most people. However, most of the
current forms of web content are designed and structured for use by people but
are barely understandable by computers. The goal of  the
Semantic Web, with its vision by Berners-lee (<a href="#vision">1998</a>), is to develop expressive
languages to describe information in forms understandable by machines. </p>
<p>XML (Extensible Markup Language, <a href="#xml">1998</a>) has brought great features and
promising prospects to the development of  the Semantic Web. Currently,
there are numerous techniques and tools available for XML, e.g., SAX (<a href="#sax">Simple API
for XML</a>), DOM (<a href="#dom">Document Object Model, 1998</a>), XSL (<a href="#xsl">Extensible Stylesheet
Language</a>), XSLT (<a href="#xslt">XSL Transformation</a>), <a href="#xpath"> XPath</a>,

<a href="#xlink"> XLink</a>, and <a href="#xpointer"> XPointer</a>, and XML parsers are available
in different languages and for different platforms.  Using XML, one can
describe document types for various domains and purposes. For example, XML
documents may represent multi-media presentations (<a href="#smil">Hoschka,
1998</a>), and business transactions (<a href="#xmledi">XML/EDI-Group</a>). Applications can access XML documents via standard interfaces like
<a href="#sax"> SAX</a> and <a href="#dom"> DOM</a>. A number of XML query languages have been proposed, including
XML-QL (<a href="#xml-ql">Deutsch, et al., 1998</a>), X-QL (<a href="#xql">Robie, 1999</a>), Lorel (<a href="#lorel">Goldman, et
al., 1999</a>), and XQuery
(<a href="#xquery">Chamberlin, et al., 2001</a>). Furthermore,  some
researchers propose  that these query languages should be extended with an
update capability so that an XML document repository becomes an XML database (<a href="#updatexml">Tatarinov, et
al., 2001</a>).</p>

<p>XML will continue to play an important role in the development of the
Semantic Web. However,  it does not provide a full solution to the requirements of the
Semantic Web. XML can represent only some semantic properties through its
syntactic structure, i.e.,  by the nesting or sequentially ordering
relationship among elements (XML tags). XML queries need to be aware of
this syntactic structure via the document type that is defined by a DTD
(Document Type Definition). Although one might derive some sort of semantics from the structure of the
documents within the context of the document type, the semantics of each
element (XML tag)  is not defined and its interpretation totally relies on the
implicit knowledge hardcoded in application programs. To develop a Web with
semantics, resources on the Web need to be represented in or annotated with
structured machine-understandable descriptions of their contents and
relationships, using vocabularies and constructs that have been explicitly and
formally defined with a domain <i>ontology</i>.   </p><p>The most
acceptable definition of ontology seems to be the following one by Gruber
(<a href="#ontologydef">1993</a>): an
ontology is a "<i>formal specification of a conceptualization</i>", and
is shared within a specific domain. The world view that an ontology embodies is
usually conceived as a hierarchical description of a set of concepts (is-a
hierarchy), a set of properties and their relationships, and a set of inference
rules. Berners-lee (<a href="#vision">1998</a>) outlined the architecture of the Semantic Web in the
following three layers: </p>
<ol>
  <li><b>The metadata layer</b>. The data model at this layer contains just the
    concepts of <i>resource</i> and <i>properties</i>. Currently, the RDF (Resource
    Description Framework) (<a href="#rdf">Lassila &amp; Swick, 1999</a>)
    is believed to be the most popular data model
    for the metadata layer. </li>

  <li><b>The schema layer</b>. Web ontology languages are introduced at this
    layer to define a hierarchical description of concepts (is-a hierarchy) and
    properties. Currently, RDFS (RDF Schema) (<a href="#rdfs">Brickley &amp;
    Guha, 2002</a>) is considered as a candidate
    schema layer language.</li>
  <li><b>The logical layer</b>. More powerful web ontology languages are
    introduced at this layer. These languages provide a richer set of modeling
    primitives that can be mapped to the well-known expressive Description Logics
    (<a href="#dl">1999</a>). Currently, OIL (<a href="#oil">Ontology Inference
    Layer, 2000</a>) and DAML-OIL (<a href="#damloil">Darpa
    Agent Markup Language-Ontology Inference Layer, 2001</a>) are two popular logical layer
    languages. </li>

</ol>
<p>With the creation and development of the Semantic Web, various web
resources will be able to be accessed by machines in a semantic fashion. The questions are,
what opportunities will this new technology bring to us and what challenges and
work are we facing now to get us from today's Web to the Web of tomorrow - the
Semantic Web?  In this paper, we share our understanding of the answers to
these questions and we hope this will shed some light on future research in this
area.</p><!--Notice how quotations are dealt with - no punctuation marks and within <blockquote></blockquote> tags. Also note how references are dealt with, using the 'Harvard system' with internal links to the reference list-->
<h2>Opportunities</h2>
<p>Like other technologies, the interest in creating and developing the Semantic
Web is motivated by the opportunities
it might bring: either it can solve new problems, or it can solve old problem in
a better way. Here, instead of enumerating all the opportunities enabled by the
Semantic Web,  we focus our discussion on the following closely related
aspects:
web-services,  agent-based distributed computing, semantics-based web
search engines, and semantics-based digital libraries. </p>
<h3> Web-services</h3>
<p>Among the most important web resources on the Semantic Web are those so
called <i>web-services</i>. Here, web-services refers to "web sites that do
not merely provide static information but allow one to effect some action or
change in the world". The Semantic Web will enable users to locate, select,
employ, compose, and monitor web-services automatically (<a href="#daml-s">Ankolekar, et
al., 2001</a>).</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Automatic web-service discovery</b>. Since semantic descriptions of
    web-services are registered with some public registries, intelligent mobile
    agents might migrate from one service registry to another to find desirable
    web-services as specified by a user.  There has been some work in
    agent-assisted browsing of the web. For example, Letizia (<a href="#letizia">Lieberman</a>)
is a user     interface agent that assists a user browsing the World Wide
Web based on the     user's profile. Letizia can learn the profile of a user
based on the user's browsing history. This idea can be applied to web-service
discovery as well.     For example, a server might provide web-services at
different levels or with     different values towards different users, and
an agent might find a     web-service based on the user's profile.</li>

  <li><b>Automatic web-service invocation.</b> Currently most web-services
    require human's intervention during their execution. For example, to
    buy a book at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">http://www.amazon.com</a>,  the
    website requires a user to fill out a form, and then click a button to
    execute the service. Usually, multiple interactions between a user and a
    web-service are needed to complete the execution of that web-service . The
    capability of automatic web-service invocation implies that a software agent
    will be able to perform these invocations on behalf of a user, who only
    needs to tell the agent to "go to Amazon and buy a book titled <i>The
    Semantic Web </i>with no more than $50", and the agent will interact with the
    web-service with appropriate input data via computer interpretable
    APIs. </li>
  <li><b>Automatic web-service composition and interoperation</b>. Given a
    library of web-services and an objective, one might be able to automatically
    select and compose a new web-service to achieve the new objective.  The
    prerequisites and consequences of individual web-services need to be
    described in a formal way, and the technology for automatic workflow
    generation (<a href="#vldb">Lu, et al., 2002</a>) might be used to generate web-services automatically.</li>
  <li><b>Automatic web-service execution monitoring.</b> For long-running
    complex web-services, it is desirable to be able to track and query the
    status of the execution of each service as well as its components.</li>

</ul>
<p>The industry has already seen the potential market enabled by
web-services  and some efforts have been put to the development of
standards for electronic commerce, in particular for the description of
web-services. For example, Microsoft, IBM and Ariba proposed UDDI (<a href="#uddi">Universal
Description, Discovery, and Integration, 2000</a>) to
describe a standard for an online registry, and the publishing and dynamic
discovery of web-services offered by  businesses; Microsoft and IBM
proposed WSDL (<a href="#wsdl">Web Service Definition Language</a>)  as an XML language to describe interfaces to web-services
registered with a UDDI database; the DAML Services Coalition proposed DAML-S (<a href="#daml-s">Darpa
Agent Markup Language - Service, 2001</a>) as an ontology to describe web-services; and OASIS and the United Nations
developed ebXML (<a href="#ebxml">Electronic Business XML Initiative, 2000</a>) to describe  business interactions from a workflow
perspective. A number of communication protocols have been developed for the
invocation of web-services: Remote Procedure Call (<a href="#rpc">Birrell &amp; Nelson, 1984</a>) is client/server
infrastructure that allows a client component of an application to employ a
function call to access a server on a remote system. The CGI (<a href="#cgi">Common
Gateway Interface</a>) mechanism  is a standard for external gateway programs
to interface with information servers such as HTTP servers. CORBA (<a href="#omg">Common
Object Request Broker Architecture</a>)  uses a registry to store interfaces of
distributed objects so that a client can invoke a method of a remote server
object without knowing its location, programming language, operating system and
other system aspects that are not part of the object's interface. SOAP (<a href="#soap">Simple Object Access
Protocol</a>) is a protocol for the exchange of information in a distributed
environment, in particular, the Web. Using SOAP, one can describe the
content of a message and the way to process it, define application-dependent
data types, and represent remote procedure calls and responses. SOAP can
potentially be used together with a variety of other protocols. Currently, its
binding with HTTP is supported.  Java RMI (<a href="#javarmi">Java Remote Method
Invocation</a>)
enables programmers to develop Java applications in which a client can invoke a
method of a remote Java Object. The ACL (Agent Communication Language)
developed by SRI International  in the framework of OAA (Open Agent
Architecture) allows one to define and publish the capabilities of agents so
that a request can be matched with a server agent by the facilitators (brokers)
(<a href="#oaa">Martin, et al., 1999</a>)</p>

<h3>Agent-based distributed computing paradigm</h3>
<p>The Semantic Web will use ontologies to describe various web resources,
hence,  knowledge on the Web will be represented in a structured, logical, and
semantic way. This will change the way that agents navigate, harvest and utilize
information on the Web (<a href="#browsingschedule">Payne, et al., 2002</a>). On one hand, the Semantic Web is a web of
distributed knowledge bases,  and agents can <i>read</i> and <i>reason</i>
about published knowledge with the guidance of ontologies. On the other hand,
the Semantic Web is a collection of web-services described by ontologies like
DAML-S (Darpa Agent Markup Language - Services) (<a href="#daml-s">Ankolekar
et al., 2001</a>) and this will facilitate dynamic matchmaking among heterogeneous
agents: service provider agents can advertise their capabilities to middle
agents; middle agents store these advertisements; a service requester agent can
ask a middle agent whether it knows of some provider agents with desired
capabilities; and the middle agent matches the request against the stored
advertisements and returns the result, a subset of the stored advertisements (<a href="#larks">Sycara, et
al., 2002</a>).</p>
<p>When agents are equipped with intelligence and mobility, the conventional
client/server computing paradigm might be replaced by an agent-based distributed
computing paradigm, in which agents can migrate from one site to another,
carrying their codes, data, running states (including internal beliefs), and
intelligence (specified by the users), and fulfill their missions autonomously
and intelligently. Many researchers have speculated that mobile agents are
inevitable for an open and distributed environment like the Semantic Web and have
seen the advantages of this new computing paradigm (<a href="#seven">Lange &amp;

Oshima, 1999</a>; <a href="#goodidea">Harrison, 1995</a>) including: </p>
<ul>
  <li>It reduces the network load.</li>
  <li>It overcomes the network latency. </li>
  <li>It supports the encapsulation of  protocols.</li>
  <li>Agents execute asynchronously and autonomously. </li>

  <li>Agents adapt dynamically.</li>
  <li>Agents are naturally heterogeneous.</li>
  <li>Agents are robust and fault-tolerant.</li>
</ul>
<p> A number of
mobile agent systems have been developed (<a href="#perret">Mauldin, 1991</a>; <a href="#ontologyagent">Luke, et
al., 1997</a>). </p>
<h3>Semantics-based web search engines</h3>

<p>Search engines are among the most useful resources on the Web and currently
there are two types of search engines:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Large-scale robot-based search engines. </b>These systems rely on
    robots to retrieve Web pages and store them in a centralized database. The
    advantage of this mechanism is that it increases <i> recall</i> (the
    proportion of relevant
    documents that are actually retrieved, <a href="#perret">Mauldin, 1991</a>) since robots can almost
    retrieve all web pages on the Web, while the disadvantage is the <i> precision</i>
    (the proportion of
    retrieved documents that are actually relevant) of the search result might be low.</li>

  <li><b>Small-scale reviewer-based search engines.</b> A category hierarchy is
    created and each category is described by a  set of keywords. Reviewers
    will review each web page (submitted by web page authors) and associate it with
    appropriate categories. The advantage is that precision is increased, but
    the disadvantage is that recall might be low since it is impossible to
    review and include every single relevant web page on the Web.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both types of search engines are based on keywords,  and hence are
subject to the two well-known linguistic phenomena that strongly degrade a query's precision
and recall: <i>polysemy</i> (one word might have several meanings) and <i>synonymy</i>
(several terms, i.e. words or phrases, might designate the same concept). A
number of stemming algorithms (<a href="#stemming">Lennon, et al., 1981</a>) have been developed to address the synonymy issue
including suffice removal, strict truncation of character strings, word
segmentation, letter bigrams and linguistic morphology. The idea is that
different derivations of a word are similar to each other in their forms (e.g. they have the
same prefix) and can be traced back to the same root (stem) using these stemming
methods. However, these methods are subject to the following stemming errors:
words with different meaning might be reduced to the same root.  For
example,  words <i>general, generous, generation, and generic</i> might be
reduced to the same root. On the other hand, different words with the same
meaning cannot be reduced to the same root. For example, <i>automobile</i> and <i>car</i>.
The situation becomes worse for  the large-scale robot-based search
engines. Only limited
semantics can be derived from the <i>lexical</i> or <i>syntactic</i> content of
the web pages.</p>

<p>Several systems have been built to overcome these problems based on the idea
of annotating Web pages with special HTML tags to represent semantics,
including  SHOE (Simple HTML Ontology Extensions) system (<a href="#ontologyagent">Luke, et
al., 1997</a>), GDA system (<a href="#alignmentontology">Ttiyama &amp; Hasida, 1997</a>). However the limitation of these
systems is that they can only process web pages that are annotated with
these HTML tags, and  so far there is no agreement upon a universally
acceptable set of HTML tags.</p>
<p>XML is a promising technique since it keeps content, structure, and
representation apart and is a much more adequate means for knowledge
representation.  However, XML can represent only some semantic properties through its
syntactic structure. XML queries need to be aware of
this syntactic structure. With the advent of the Semantic Web,  resources on the Web
will be represented semantically in ontologies. Semantics-based web search
engines can be built in which each query is executed within the context of some
ontology. The guidance from ontologies will increase recall and precision of the
search result. For example, one might pose a query "<i>return all the
reviewers for book 'The Semantic Web: an Introduction</i>'" to a
semantics-based web search engine, then the engine will return only reviewers
for this book instead of returning web pages that contain keyword
"reviewer" and/or term "The Semantic Web: an Introduction".
For another example, if one pose query "<i>return all the chairs</i>",
with the guidance of a furniture ontology, only those furniture chairs  are
returned; and with the guidance of a person ontology, only people who are chairs
of some organizations will be returned. In contrast, Keyword-based search
engines will return web sites that contain keyword "chairs", including
chairs that refer to furniture and chairs that refer to people. It is worth
mentioning that some systems that use ontologies to enhance web search engines
have been developed (<a href="#ontologysearch">Barros, et al., 1998</a>; <a href="#howtoxml">Erdmann, et
al., 2001</a>). Since ontologies are built on a domain basis, web
search engines might be also built on a domain basis, and hence metasearch
engines, which interface with multiple remote search engines and select and rank
remote search engines intelligently,  might be very useful (<a href="#metasearch">Dreilinger

&amp; Howe, 1997</a>).</p>
<h3>Semantics-based digital libraries</h3>
<p>Digital multimedia data in various formats has increased tremendously
in recent years on the Internet. With the development of digital photography,
more and more people are able to store their personal photographs on their
PCs. Sharing of picture albums and home videos on the Internet becomes more
and more popular.  Furthermore, many organizations have large image and video
collections in digital format available for online access. Film producers
want to advertise movies through interactive preview clips. Travel agencies
are interested in digital achieves of holiday resorts photographs. Hospitals
would like to build medical image databases. These emerging applications
for multimedia digital libraries require interdisciplinary research in the
areas of image processing, computer vision, information retrieval and database
management.<br>
<br>Semantics-based retrieval of multimedia digital content is important
for efficient use of the multimedia data repositories. Traditional content-based
multimedia retrieval techniques describe images/videos based on low level
features (such as color, texture, and shape) and support retrieval based
on these features (<a href="#imager">Smeulders, et al., 2000</a>). However, human typically does not view images/videos in terms of low-level features.
A semantics-based query capability is highly desirable. For example, one might
want to formulate a query like "<i>return all the scenes in clip 1 in which a
boy is riding a bicycles</i>".  Retrieving images/videos based on low-level features cannot provide satisfactory results
(<a href="#imageclass">Vaiulaya, et al., 2001</a>). Effective and precise multimedia retrieval by semantics remains an open and challenging problem
(<a href="#imageclass">Vaiulaya, et al., 2001</a>; <a href="#semanticvideo">Naphade, et
al., 2001</a>].</p>

<p>Recently, ontologies begin to be used in the context of digital libraries.
For example, ScholOnto (<a href="#scholonto">Shum 2000</a>) is an ontology-based digital library that supports
scholarly interpretation and discourse, and ARION (<a href="#ontodev">Corcho,
2000</a>), another ontology-based
digital library that supports search and navigation of  geospatial data
sets and environmental applications.</p>
<p>We believe that various digital libraries will become another major web
resource of the Semantic Web. The challenges here are: (1) The development of
efficient and effective classification and indexing mechanism for each type of
digital library, and (2) The semantic interoperability between digital libraries of
similar types and between a digital library and the Semantic Web.</p>
<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>New opportunities impose new challenges. In the following, we focus our
discussion on the following challenges that we are facing now: the development of
ontologies, and the
development of the formal semantics of Semantic Web languages, and the
development of trust and proof models.</p>
<h3>The development of ontologies</h3>
<p>It is well recognized within the Semantic Web community that ontologies
will play an essential role in the development of the Semantic Web.
Various effort has been devoted to the research of different aspects of
ontologies, including ontology representation languages (<a href="#ontodev">Corcho, 2000</a>),
ontology development (<a href="#ontodev2">Jones, et al, 1998</a>), ontology learning approaches
(<a href="#ontologylearn">Maedche &amp; Staab, 2001</a>), and ontology library systems
(<a href="#ontolibsurvey">Ding &amp;  Fensel, 2001</a>), which manage, adapt, and
standardize ontologies.</p>

<p><b>Management.  </b>The main purpose of ontologies is to enable
knowledge sharing and re-use, hence a typical ontology library system supports
open storage and organization, identification and versioning. Open storage and
organization address how ontologies are stored and organized in a library system
to facilitate access and management of ontologies. Identification associates
each ontology with a unique identifier. Versioning is an important feature since
ontologies evolve over time and a versioning mechanism can ensure the
consistency of different versions of ontologies.</p>
<p><b>Adaption.</b>  Since ontologies evolve over time, how to extend and
update existing ontologies is an important issue. This includes the searching,
editing and reasoning of ontologies in an ontology library system.</p>
<p><b>Standardization.</b> Integration and interoperability is always the
concern of any open system. This is especially the concern of the Semantic Web,
an open system that has to be scalable at the Internet level.  Currently, a
number of ontology representation languages have been proposed (<a href="#ontodev">Corcho, et
al., 2000</a>) and various
ontology library systems have been built (<a href="#ontolibsurvey">Ding &amp;
Fensel, 2001</a>). The question is what would be the
standardized ontology representation language. Each of them seems to have its
advantages and disadvantages, and has its proponents and opponents. This might be a
feature of our human being society: each of us has his/her preference. Since the
Semantic Web is still at its early stage, it might be too early to enforce any
standardization. Each representation language can grow on its own and the one or
a few ones who win will become the de facto standards.  XML might serve as
the meta-languages of these representations to facilitate future interoperation
and integration. </p>
<h3>Formal semantics of the Semantic Web languages</h3>

<p>The functional architecture of the Semantic Web has three layers: the
metadata layer, the schema layer and the logical layer.  Currently, the RDF
(<a href="#rdf">Resource
    Description Framework, 1999</a>) is believed to be the most popular data model
    for the metadata layer. Although it is believed that the RDF data model is
enough for defining and using metadata, the semantics of reification (statement
about statement) is yet to be defined. RDFS (<a href="#rdfs">RDF Schema</a>) extends RDF and is
currently a popular schema layer language. It has been recognized that RDFS
lacks a formal semantics and one proposal is to define a metamodeling
architecture for RDFS similar to the one for UML (Universal Modeling Language), and hence defines a formal
semantics (<a href="#metamodellingarchi">Pan &amp; Horrocks, 2001</a>). This approach, although formal, is
complicated and not intuitive. Although RDFS has been blamed for its semantic
confusion and some apparent paradox, it has not been shown that a formal
semantics is impossible. To smooth the way of developing the Semantic Web, we
believe that the semantics of RDFS need to be resolved: either a formal
semantics is defined for it, or the problem of RDFS is pinned down so that the
semantic issue can be resolved.</p>
<h3>Proof and trust</h3>
<p>As an open and distributed system, the Semantic Web bears the spirit that
"anybody can say anything on anybody".  People all over the world
might assert some statements which  can possibly conflict. Hence, one needs
to make sure that the original source does make a particular statement (proof)
and that source is trustworthy (trust).</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Proof.</b> Digital signatures will play an important role in proof. The
    source has to sign the statement he makes so that agents can check if
    information really comes from the source it claims to be. In addition, other
    security technologies like encryption and access control can be used to
    ensure confidentiality of information.  </li>

  <li><b>Trust.</b> Everybody should be able to define a trust model for
    himself, i.e., one can define how much trust he would put on each source on
    the Semantic Web. Since it is unrealistic to define the extent of trust for
    each source, a mechanism is necessary to derive the degree of trust for each
    new source.  One solution is the notion of  "web of
    trust": when one trusts a source A, he also trusts all other sources
    that are trusted by source A, but to a lower extent, in this way, a huge and
    hierarchical network is created which facilitates agents infer information
    based on their trusted knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, the notion of proof and trust have yet to be formalized, and a
theory that integrates them into inference engines of the Semantic Web is yet to
be developed. However,  these technologies are very important and are the
foundation of building real commercial applications (e.g., B2B and B2C systems).<br>
</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this paper,
  we reported a survey of recent research on the Semantic Web. In particular, we
  presented the opportunities that this new revolution will bring to us, and the
  challenges that we are facing during the development of the Semantic Web. We
hope that this paper will shed some light on the direction of future work.</p>
<p>The Semantic Web is still a vision.  We believe that the Web will grow
towards this vision in a way like the development of the real world: Semantic
Web communities will appear and grow first, and then the interaction and
interoperation among different communities will finally interweave them into the
Semantic Web. </p>

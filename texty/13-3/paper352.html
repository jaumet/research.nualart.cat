<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>For some time now, the  relationship between university and private enterprise has been receiving  increasing attention, both from research policy planners and managers, with a  view to enhancing cooperation, and from researchers analysing and seeking to improve and make such collaboration more effective through networking. The  European Union&rsquo;s Sixth Framework Programme, for instance, designed a scenario  with the explicit purpose of increasing and strengthening interconnections  among the various research sectors participating in and leading the European  Research Area. The Seventh Framework Programme includes a specific programme,  called Cooperation, whose purpose is to further and support cooperation among  universities, private enterprise, research centres and public authorities   (European Union, <a href="#E25">2002</a>, <a href="#E26">2006</a>).</p>

<p>The various reasons for this ambition all revolve around the complexity  and high cost of scientific and technology policies. In Spain also, decentralized support  for small teams&rsquo; personal initiatives is steadily being replaced by centralized  support for large interdisciplinary and inter-organizational groups. Against a  backdrop of intense global competition, speedy technological change and shorter  and shorter product life cycles, private enterprise has become increasingly  aware that the sources of competitive advantage are not to be found exclusively  in-house, but rather are present in other organizations. Hence, the  inter-organizational relations geared to knowledge creation and transfers have  acquired vital importance in business practice. In this regard, some authors  have stressed the relevance for innovation of networking between companies and  other organizations such as universities.</p>

<p>Universities are unique  from the standpoint of their potential for generating and disseminating  information that is directly applicable to production processes, but also because  scientific inventions delimit and expand companies' long-term technological  boundaries. Universities also furnish qualified and mobile human resources,  researchers and/or students, whose services can be enlisted by the corporate  world. Both types of organizations raise funding for research through competitive  tendering processes, create technology-based companies and generate patentable  inventions. While companies can gain prestige by forging alliances with reputed  universities, students and professors benefit from employment opportunities,  exposure to practical problems during attachments and access to areas with a  strong applied technology bias. In short, this type of collaboration benefits  both organizations in key R&amp;D activities and cooperation between  universities and private enterprise forms a significant part of the advancement  of both scientific and technical knowledge   (<a href="#L13">Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz 2001</a>).</p>

<p> While the volume of  literature on collaboration between the university and private enterprise has  grown significantly over the last few decades, few papers have specifically  attempted to use bibliometric data to explain and visualize how these  partnerships are established. The present article contributes  to the growing volume of literature on the links between the university and  private enterprise, in the context of an economy geared to knowledge and  innovation. Recently, studies on knowledge transfer between  universities  and private enterprise have addressed questions such as the production of  technological knowledge in universities   (<a href="#D7">Dur&aacute;n-Romero 2003</a>), the formation of  scientific and technological parks  (<a href="#O18">Ondategui 2001</a>), the technological  relationship between private enterprise and the public R&amp;D system (<a href="#F8">Fundaci&oacute;n Cotec 1999</a>), joint research contracts (<a href="#B2">Bayona-S&aacute;ez <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>), certain types of interaction, such as PhD mobility toward private enterprise (<a href="#C6">Cruz-Castro and Sanz-Men&eacute;ndez 2005</a>) and the analysis of scientific citations in patents (<a href="#A1">Acosta and Coronado 2003</a>; <a href="#P21">Plaza <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>).</p>

<p>As generators of  scientific knowledge, universities publicize the results of their research in  globally open articles, using the channels afforded by existing journals to  share their findings as widely as possible with different communities and  audiences. This  information, openly publicized to serve a community, makes universities  epistemic institutions and sets them apart in this respect from private  companies. According  to Dasgupta and David   (<a href="#dasgupta">1994</a>), industrial innovation  and research is conducted to grow the revenues stemming from the possession of  private knowledge. In academia, the aim is to maximize the dissemination of knowledge, by  contrast with companies. Another distinction between the two types of organizations rests in the different way deadlines are set to achieve research  objectives. University  researchers can establish long-term objectives, experiment more and undertake  high-risk projects that may be successful or otherwise in time, for their organizations are very stable and can be neither taken over nor merged, unlike  businesses, &ldquo;which are subject to potentially strong market pressures and  experience liabilities of newness and obsolescence&rdquo; (<a href="#owen">Owen-Smith and Powell 2004: 8</a>). </p>

<p>In the present study,  the focus is on the analysis of a particular type of knowledge transfer among  universities, private enterprise and the public sector in a regional R&amp;D  system, taking the Community of Madrid as the basis for a case study. From the  standpoint of a theoretical approach, cooperation between enterprise and  research bodies may adopt many different formulae. Examples include support for  research, joint research, knowledge or technology transfer, strategic alliances   (<a href="#S23">Santoro and Chakrabati 2002</a>). Here it has been assumed  that knowledge transfer includes a very broad range of both formal and informal  types of interaction: for instance, contacts stemming from personal  relationships, cooperative education, shared development of curricula, establishment of  university and corporate consortia, recruitment of university graduates and  post-doctoral fellows or attachments in companies (<a href="#M15">Mora-Valent&iacute;n 2002</a>).</p>

<p>Another form is the  inter-institutional co-authorship of research articles, a more loosely  structured mechanism of knowledge transfer. Inter-institutional co-authorship,  regardless of the type of organizations involved, occurs when at least two  different co-authors of a scientific paper have different affiliations. This  type of interaction entails the tacit transfer of information and knowledge as  a result of personal contacts between the authors, even where the process is  scantly formalized. It is the tangible reflection of one aspect of knowledge  transfer, inasmuch as it is coded; it is the most formal manifestation of  intellectual partnering in scientific research and has become a standard  indicator for measuring scientific cooperation. And within the framework of the  Triple Helix model, the study of this type of cooperation acquires a new  dimension   (<a href="#G9">Gl&auml;nzel and Schubert 2004</a>, among others).</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Research on social networks explores the reasons for their creation and  the consequences they generate. Network  analysis may be conducted at different levels or defining different groupings. In some cases the object of the analysis is the  relationships or links between two actors in a given network. In such analysis each actor is associated with  only one other and the all nodes or actors are measured in terms of the same  set of variables. On the grounds of this type  of dyadic analysis, data and hypotheses can be aggregated to higher and higher  levels, to ultimately embrace the entire network.</p>

<p>In addition to the level of analysis, network studies differ in terms of the characterization of the  links and functions present in the network. If the objective is to explain the configuration of  a co-authorship network structure, depending on the number of links and the  selection of nodes studied, the interconnection patterns that appear may be  more or less dense. Several authors have noted that such different structures reflect  different types of social capital. &ldquo;Social capital refers to the norms and networks that enable people to  act collectively&rdquo; (<a href="#W35">Woolcock and Narayan 2000: 226</a>). A distinction is drawn  in this regard between <em>bridging</em> and <em>bonding</em> social capital. The network structures deriving from associations  based on these varying dimensions of social capital are described as follows: </p>

<blockquote>...bridging social capital is associated with large,  loose networks, relatively strict reciprocity, perhaps a thinner or different  sort of trust, greater risk of norm violation and more instrumentality. Bonding social capital is associated with dense,  multiple networks, long term reciprocity, thick trust, shared norms and less  instrumentality  (<a href="#L30">Leonard and Onyx 2003: 193</a>).</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, the social  structure underlying university-government-enterprise has as many different  components as there are products of the forms of organization or partnering and  activities. Hence, it would take a good number of graphs to describe the <em>true</em>  underlying structure. In graph theory terminology, several sub-graphs centred on the same nodes must be considered collectively. Inasmuch as each graph  measures something different, none can be replaced by any other. Network analysis differentiates among network structures that are not necessarily  mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>The first hypothesis  examined here, rather than focusing on the overall collaboration of <em>all</em> the actors in the selected  scientific domains, can be studied at the <em>level of inter-actor</em> collaboration. This would identify <em>bridging networks</em> with low density link patterns and variations in  the sub-network structure, for weak ties are instrumental in disseminating  ideas, exchanging technical information and inter-linking communities (<a href="#granovetter1">Granovetter 1973</a>, <a href="#granovetter2">1982</a>). The network boundaries  approach is therefore nominalist, based on theoretical concerns.</p>

<p>The purpose of this article is to present the results of a microanalysis of inter-institutional  co-authorship networks comprising only three actors, namely universities,  government and private companies located in Madrid, inferred from co-authorship data on the published results  of joint research. <em>Government</em>; is understood to mean any central, regional or  local public body excepting universities, research hospitals, institutes or public research bodies, from 1995 to 2003. Representations of  inter-organizational co-authorship subnetworks of this nature would corroborate  its spatial and temporal dimensions.</p>

<p>The aims are to  ascertain each network actor&rsquo;s position and characteristics, determine how  information flows across the bridging network and detect and  identify the organizations working in the three subject categories considered:  Medicine, Physiology and Pharmacology and Molecular, Cellular and Genetic Biology. Sectoral differences are assumed to depend on the intellectual nature  and technological characteristics of knowledge, as well as on organization size  and the effects of proximity. Thus stated, the objectives of this study are  modest: it aims to show the usefulness of a methodology, namely structural and  network analysis, applied to the understanding, characterization and  visualization of the cooperation and interaction among institutions and their  evolution, in contributing to a regional domain analysis of the Community of  Madrid.</p>

<p>To achieve these  objectives, this article is structured as follows: the first section explains  the methodology and data used. The second sets out the results and graphic representation built from social network analysis and the third discusses the  conclusions and future lines of research.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>This study used relational methods to analyse and represent the structures emerging from  cooperation. Structural and social network analysis is based on graph theory,  which has undergone substantial development in recent decades, primarily in  sociology and the study of organizational forms  (<a href="#wasserman">Wasserman and Faust 1994</a>; <a href="#R22">Rodr&iacute;guez 1995</a>) and  in information science (<a href="#H10">Haythornthwaite 1996</a>; <a href="#O20">Otte and Rousseau 2002</a>). The use of this  methodology has not yet been widely extended to the study of scientific  cooperation networks involving universities, government and private enterprise,  but it has been deployed in other studies of scientific collaboration based on  co-authorship: to identify, for instance, inter-institutional networks of elite  research centres (<a href="#N17">Nagpaul 2002</a>), international co-authorship networks  (<a href="#li">Li-Chun <em>et al.</em> 2006</a>) or research cooperation  networks among biopharmaceutical companies   (<a href="#C4">Calero <em>et al.</em> 2007</a>).</p>

<p>Data construction is an  essential part of the process that precedes the application of network  analysis. This often entails converting the data available to a relational  format. The basic elements that define a network are essentially: the actors  who establish inter-relationships (in the present case, universities, private  companies or government bodies) and the relationships themselves  (inter-institutional co-authorship, for instance). The former are represented  by points, circles or spheres and the latter by lines on the node network.  Structural and network analysis is based, practically speaking, on the creation  and development of the relationship matrix and the construction of the  respective graph. When a relational analysis is to be conducted, the basic  material for the analysis is the construction of the matrix that inter-relates  the actors. Co-authorship data are fairly readily available and standardized  allowing for regional, national and international comparison and could be used  primarily as an indicator of long-lasting research partnerships between large  firms and universities (<a href="#bordons">Bordons and G&oacute;mez 2000</a>).</p>

<p>The data presented here were downloaded from the Thomson Scientific  databases contained on the <em>Web of Science</em>. The existence of a record with at least one Madrid address in the address field was  the retrieval criterion used. The period studied was 1995 to 2003. The  relational base was built from the 65,896 documents of all types retrieved (articles, biographical items, book reviews, corrections, editorial materials, letters, meeting abstracts, news items and reviews). Subsequently, a selection was made of papers having intra-regional co-authors affiliated with universities, private enterprise or government  bodies located in Madrid.  A paper was regarded to be inter-institutionally co-authored if its authors had  different institutional affiliations.</p>

<p>This definition was  operational because the Madrilenian addresses appearing in the records were  standardized by semi-automatic procedures to place a given organization,  regardless of how it was cited, under a single denomination. Each institution  was allocated to one of the following sectors: government, Spanish Scientific  Research Council mixed centres, Spanish Scientific Research Council, health  system, universities, private enterprise, public research bodies and other  types of institutions.</p>

<p>In this study  cooperation was estimated primarily on the basis of the documentary universe,  with no further restrictions: in other words, from all the various types of  documents listed in the three source databases. One of the problems that arises  in bibliometric analysis of scientific disciplines is the manner in which  documents are assigned to the different scientific areas. In large-scale  analyses, the only practical information on the allocation of documents to a  given subject field on the grounds of origin is provided by the subject categories into which the ISI divides published scientific knowledge in its <em>Journal Citation Reports</em> (JCR), for listing  the journals where papers are published. These ISI categories were subsequently  re-classified to establish more restricted schemes such as the ANEP scheme chosen for the present analysis. ANEP, the Spanish National Agency for  Evaluation and Prospective Studies, is a Ministry of Science and Innovation  body under the aegis of the Secretariat of State for Universities   (<a href="#A28">ANEP 2006</a>).</p> 
  
  
<p> ANEP's expert evaluators  assign to each ANEP class the ISI-JCR categories they deem appropriate. As in  the ISI-JCR, one and the same category can be listed under different ANEP  classes  (<a href="#O19">Olmeda-G&oacute;mez <em>et al.</em> 2007a</a>). The use of journal classifications to divide and then reclassify articles into subject categories,  is widely accepted in bibliometric studies (<a href="#grupp">Grupp and Hinze 1994</a>; <a href="#K12">Katz <em>et al.</em> 1995</a>; <a href="#G29">Glanzel and Lange 2002</a>; <a href="#M31">Ma and Guan 2005</a>; <a href="#cindoc">CINDOC 2006</a>) and has been proposed  and used as a unit for visualizing specific scientific domains (<a href="#M16">Moya-Aneg&oacute;n <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>) as well as in many  <a href="http://www.scimago.es/mod/resource/view.php?id=45">SCImago&acute;s research reports</a> (<a href="#O34">Olmeda-G&oacute;mez <em>et al.</em> 2007b</a>).</p>

<p>Taking total regional production as a point of departure, matrices were generated from the type distribution  of documents authored by Madrilenian institutions pertaining to some one of the three sectors studied (intra-regional cooperation). Only the subject categories  with the highest percentage of intra-regional cooperation were selected   (Table 1).</p>

<p><em>Confirmation</em> or <em>reciprocity</em> is an important property of  links in social networks. The degree of confirmation is determined not by the  definition of the link but by the extent to which two nodes report the same  relationships with one another in a given content area   (<a href="#tichy">Tichy and Tushman 1979</a>). An asymmetric co-authorship index was used to show bidirectional reciprocity, as reflected by the direction of the arrows in the maps  constructed, and thereby determine the degree of asymmetry in such  cooperative relations; in other words, to identify the lack of reciprocity in  or confirmation of the importance that any two partner institutions may  represent for one another. The idea was borrowed from the affinity index used  to measure asymmetric relations between two countries and adapted to reflect first of all, the scientific importance of given partnerhips in total  co-authorship  (<a href="#Z27">Zitt <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>). It was calculated from  the following formulas used to measure the direction of cooperation between any  two nodes:</p>

</div>
  <br />
  <div align="center"><strong>Figure 1: Formulae for calculating asymmetric cooperation rates</strong></div>


<p>In the map charted for this purpose, the arrows indicate the direction of the dependence of the  institution in question with regard to the organizations to which it is  connected. Thickness denotes the strength or intensity of the inter-dependence.</p>

<p>The maps charted to visualize university-government-company relations in  the region of Madrid  were generated from social network analysis as described above. The resulting  matrices were processed and analysed with Pajek software and graphed with the  Kamada-Kawai algorithm   (<a href="#K11">1989</a>). The final networks were exported for scalable vector graphics (SVG)  formatting. </p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>Table 1 gives the cooperation rate, i.e., the proportion of the  production contained in the WoS for the Community of Madrid that was inter-institutionally co-authored, along with the distribution by type of  cooperation. The following were defined: &ldquo;no cooperation&rdquo;, signed by a single  institution; &ldquo;intra-regional&rdquo; cooperation, signed by at least two institutions  located in Madrid; &ldquo;national&rdquo; cooperation,  signed by at least one other Spanish institution outside Madrid and &ldquo;international&rdquo; cooperation, when  at least one foreign institution was involved. Therefore, &ldquo;intra-regional&rdquo; data are not found only in that category,  for some may also be included under &ldquo;national&rdquo; or &ldquo;international&rdquo;  collaboration. &nbsp;&ldquo;Physiology and Pharmacology&rdquo;, &ldquo;Medicine&rdquo; and  &ldquo;Molecular, Cellular and Genetic Biology&rdquo; were the subject categories with the  highest percentages of intra-regional cooperation, with the highest value being  recorded for medicine (24.57%).</p>

<p>The percentage production by type of sector in the two sub-periods into  which the overall period was divided, along with the production attributed to  each of the sectors in the categories in question, are shown in Table 2. These  data were used for the micro-analysis of cooperation among the three  institutional sectors studied. The  combined weight of the three sectors did not exceed 30% in any of the  categories, because other organizations, primarily research hospitals or public  research bodies, were very productive in these areas, particularly in Medicine  and Physiology and Pharmacology. The  research output measured for the organizations studied is lower in these last  areas. The percentage increase in industrial research in the areas of  Physiology and Pharmacology between periods failed to raise output in 2000-2003. One possible inference is the existence of papers  in which all the co-authors are companies. As result of  the high university rate of productivity, three in ten medical articles were  authored by private firms with government or university involvement. The  private sector (18.03% in 1995-1999), like the government and universities,  cooperated most intensely in Molecular, Cellular and Genetic Biology, a class  in which authors from twelve universities published very actively.</p>

<p>As indicated above, a second approach to the study of scientific article  co-authorship focused on the analysis of the relationships between inter-institutional co-authors. Social network analysis methods geared  to subsequent micro-analysis could be introduced in the study because of the  way co-authorship relationships were defined: namely, as the associations found  in documents contained in the <em>Web of  Science</em> and produced in Madrid in the ANEP subject categories Medicine,  Physiology and Pharmacology and Molecular, Cellular and Genetic Biology,  signed by university, private enterprise and governmental organizations.</p>

<p>In the present study,  social network analysis was a source of tools for reviewing a series of  properties referring to: 1) the general structure of the network of relationships induced by co-authorship and 2) the position occupied by individual, or groups of, actors in the overall structure or with respect to  other actors. In this context, one aspect of particular interest was how the  general structure of the relationship network was reflected in the degree of  integration or coherence exhibited. Information was likewise sought on the  position of each of the actors in the overall structure and, as in the case of  structure, any variations in those positions.</p>

<p>Network density,  expressed as the relationship between the actual over the total possible number  of connections is low, for a given author. It is nonetheless recommended as a  measure of group cohesion and to quantify network <em>knittedness</em>. Network density is not, however, a particularly useful indicator if the values are  small, such as in the examples studied here, for it depends on network size.</p>

<p>The number of links at  each vertex, i.e., the normalized degree for a vertex, is a more informative  parameter. The vertices having the highest degree are located in the densest  part of the network. The greater the number of nodes with high degree values,  the denser is the network, for it means that the vertices have more  inter-connections. Accordingly, the average degree for all vertices can be used  as a measure of structural coherence in networks, with the advantage that this  value is independent of network size and can be used to compare networks of  different sizes. Both in Medicine and Molecular Biology, this indicator was observed  to increase across the two periods studied, denoting a rise in the number of  links among network actors in the years in question and suggesting that a  denser network was formed among relevant actors in academia, industry and  government at the end of the period. Conversely, the Physiology and  Pharmacology network was more sparse despite the incorporation of twelve new  actors.</p>

<p>All the networks  consisted of a very small number of subgroups or components. On these graphs, a  component is the maximum number of connected sub-graphs and the main component  is the largest subset of directly inter-linked organizations.The number of  components was not high, an indication that there were few unconnected nodes  formed part of alternate networks still in an early phase. The percentage of  organizations connected to the main component was never under 88.8% of the  co-authors in any of the networks. The number of Physiology and Pharmacology  network components grew thanks to the existence of new entrants not linked to the  main component. The Molecular Biology network, by contrast, had only one  component because links can be established between any node pair and the four  new entrants were linked to the existing component.</p>

<p>'<em>Degree centralization  of a network is the variation in the degrees of vertices divided by the maximum  degree variation which is possible in a network of the same size</em>' (<a href="#hanneman">Hanneman and Riddle 2005</a>). This group level <em>centralization</em> index measures the  variability or heterogeneity of node centralities and records the extent to  which one of the actors is characterized by high and the others by low  centrality. The value of this index ranges from zero to one. A value of one  means that a given node is connected to all the other nodes on the network and  each of the others interacts only with that initial node; the result is a  star-shaped network, where one node or actor dominates the network entirely,  overshadowing all the others. Zero in turn means that all nodes have the same  degree, giving rise to a circular graph. The highest values found for the  networks studied here, 0.63 (1995-1999) for Physiology and Pharmacology and 0.74  (2000-2003) for Molecular, Cellular and Genetic Biology, were consistent with the  respective graphic representations.</p>

<p>A given node's importance in the circulation of  information within a network can be explained by the concept of betweenness. In  this case the indicator is betweenness centralization, '<em>which measures the  variation in vertex betweenness values in a network divided by the maximum possible  variation in betweenness values in a network of the same size</em>' (<a href="#hanneman">Hanneman&nbsp; and Riddle 2005</a>). Hence, different networks  can be compared on the grounds of the heterogeneity of network members'  betweenness (<a href="#wasserman">Wasserman and Faust 1994</a>). At the group level, it measures  whether co-authorship networks are <em>compact</em>,  i.e., whether the distances between pairs of nodes are short because they are  connected across the same intermediaries. This would be the case of the Biology  (2000-2003, 0.77), but not the Medicine network (2000-2003, 0.43).</p>

<p>The clustering coefficient, a measure introduced by <a href="#watts">Watts  and Strogatz (1998)</a>, measures the degree of cooperation of a given author's co-authors and is  calculated as the arithmetic mean in each of the networks. A high clustering  coefficient value suggests the formation of extremely densely connected local  areas in different networks. It is an indicator of network transitivity, in  other words of mean network density in the vicinity of a node. In such  cooperation networks it is, therefore, an indicator of the tendency of the  network to form small groups or clusters. Due to the very low values in this study, no community or group of nodes  sharing similar properties could be identified in any of the networks.</p>

<p>To simplify the centrality data of nodes, the  organizations with the highest normalized degree and betweenness values in the  university-government-enterprise cooperation networks, in 1995-03, are listed  in Table 4. The ten organizations with the highest normalized degree and  betweenness values were selected. The organizations in normal typeface are  universities, while the ones in italics are companies or public bodies.</p>

<p>Degree values are generally used to identify network  leaders. The maximum centrality degree values are associated with the best  reputation or greatest influence in a network, structurally speaking; in this  case they also measure the cooperative activity of each network node. As the  data show, in 1995-1999, the highest degree values were found for three  universities, the Complutense University of Madrid, Autonomous University of  Madrid and University   of Alcal&aacute; de Henares.  These three actors had the highest degree values, played the main role in the  shaping of the university-government-enterprise cooperation networks in the Community  of Madrid and were the most structurally <em>influential</em>. A smaller number of  companies than of universities was found in these top ten positions, denoting a  lower joint production of scientific papers. Such low betweenness values  indicate that while companies cooperated with some other centre, undoubtedly a  university, they had no role in network gatekeeping. Indeed, some organizations  were invisible because they scored zero in betweenness: they did not serve as  inter-organizational hubs.</p>

<p>We utilize Pajek to present a series of images of the  evolution of the networks using Kamada-Kawai algorithm  (<a href="#K11">Kamada Kwai 1989</a>).</p> 

<blockquote>This algorithm assigns coordinates to the nodes,  trying to adjust as much as possible the distances existing among them with  respect to theorethical distances. Its use is widespread in the representation  of social networks, owing to the assignment of an unitary distance to each link;  and it offers very good results in the esthetic sense, along with adequate  computation times for its application (<a href="#vargas">Vargas-Quesada and Moya-Aneg&oacute;n 2007</a>: 51-52).</blockquote>

<p>Two sets of images,  1995-1999 and 2000-2003, were plotted for asymmetric cooperation networks in each class  covered by our database (Figures 2 a-b to 4 a-b). Node colour indicates the  type of organization: sky blue for universities, violet for private enterprise  and green for government agencies. Node  diameters are proportional to each institution&rsquo;s co-authorship scientific  output for each period.</p>  

<p>The graphs shows a structure with several centres and  peripheries, where the universities with the highest degrees constituted the  centres and the peripheries were comprised by companies and other  organizations, most of which had connections with the universities only   (<a href="#B3">Borgatti and Everett 1999</a>). The figures shown below provide an overview of the  different central organizations and the constellations and sizes of the  peripheral organizations.</p>

<p>Several key features,  particularly prominent in the Physiology and Pharmacology network (Figure  2a-2b), were shared by all the networks as a whole. The prevailing colours were  blue followed by violet, indicating that the most active participants were  universities and enterprises, with government agencies playing a minor role.  The largest node in the centre of the graphic display represented the  Complutense University of Madrid, the central node in this star or radial  network. Note the very active role played by UCM  researchers in forging co-authorship ties with multinational firms such as  Glaxo Wellcome, Lilly, Merck Serono and Boehringer Ingelheim, as well as  Spanish biotech firms such as Pharmar or Kubus, which specialize in assisted reproduction for swine.</p>

<br />
<p>Local Spanish  pharmaceutical firms such as Alter, Tedec, IFCSA or Normon established clear  ties with two other universities: The Autonomous University of Madrid and the University of Alcal&aacute; de Henares, while Knoll, a  subsidiary of Abbott Laboratories, partners with a private Catholic university,  CEUM.</p>

<p>Figure 2b show the  configuration of the new ties and nodes added in 2000-2003. The graph reflects  the growing intricacy of participants' activity and reveals expanded  collaboration. Large blue nodes can be seen at the centre of the new network,  along with a shift in the composition of the most intensely connected  participants. Another prominent characteristic is the diversity of types of  organizations at the centre of the network (UCM) and their positions: large  pharmaceutical companies (Glaxo, AstraZeneca, Lilly, Knoll), research  universities (UAM, UAH, URJC, UNED) and public and private Spanish firms  (Tragsal and Kubus).</p>

<p>Medicine networks  (Figures 3a and 3b) exhibit certain similarities, along with substantial  differences. Universities,  particularly the UCM, predominate, orbited by government entities and many  private companies. University ties, the backbone for the two networks,  were intensified, as shown by the shift in the positions to closer proximity  among UCM, UCH and UAM in the period 2000-2003. The government entities involved were: Forensic Division of the Police Force (CGCP), the National Toxicology  Institute (INTM), the Council for Nuclear Security (CSNM) and a number of  central Government departments such as the Ministries of Defence and  Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (now Agriculture and the Environment), the  National Sports Council and the National Institute for Consumer Affairs.</p>

<p>In 2000-2003 network structures  increased in size, due primarily to the appearance of new companies and  government bodies, a reflection of the intensification of scientific paper  co-authorship.&nbsp; Subsidiaries of large  multinationals such as Glaxo Wellcome, ALK Abello, Lilly-Espa&ntilde;a Laboratories,  Pfizer, Celltech-Pharma and Aventis appeared, along with small and medium-sized  domestic enterprises such as Pharmamar, Laboratorios Leti, Pharma Gen,  Laboratorios Normon and Biomet.</p>

<p>None of these small  and medium-sized companies was a core participant, nor did they serve as hubs  as a general rule. Rather, they entered the networks through their association  with a large organization, such as a university. This finding is consistent  with observations in other papers to the effect that the publication of  scientific articles is not one of the most relevant activities from the  standpoint of corporate relations with universities   (<a href="#M14">Meyer-Krahmer and Schmoch,1998</a>; <a href="#S24">Schartinger <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>), even though companies  regard scientific papers to be the prevalent channel for obtaining information  from public research bodies that can be incorporated into their own research  projects   (<a href="#C5">Cohen <em>et al.</em> 2002</a>). </p>

<p>Connections in areas  like Medicine are often forged with a specific goal in mind, such as conducting  experiments with a new drug when financing is available. This may explain the  dyadic relations between the Spanish Army&rsquo;s Light Aircraft Corps (FAMET) and  the Training Center of Aerospace  Medicine (CIMAM) or between two penitentiaries (CPMS-CPM2).</p>

<p>The Molecular,  Cellular and Genetic Biology network is shown in Figures 4a and 4b. In the  earlier period, the centre was again occupied by the multi-connected nodes  representeing two universities, the UCM and the UAM. A group of well known  biomedical multinational firms appeared as UAM satellites: Pfizer Glaxo  Wellcome and ALK Abello. The Spanish firms interconnected with this university  included Laboratorios Leti, Tabac and Petrem. UCM researchers, by contrast,  were associated with a variety of types of organizations, showing a preference  for diversity in light of their ability to undertake many activities with  different partners.</p>

<p>The new ties  appearing in the 2000-2003 graph reflect the growing complexity in  participants' co-authorship activities. Centre-left of the network, the diversity of organizations circling the UCM includes universities, local and multinational firms and government entities. Powell <em>et al.</em>, in their article about network collaboration in the life science industry, observe that: &ldquo;such diversely anchored, multi-connected networks are  less likely to unravel than networks reliant on a single form of organization  for their cohesiveness&rdquo;. (<a href="#powell">Powell <em>et al.</em> 2005: 1161</a>), such was reasoned by Albert <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#albert">2000</a>).</p>

<p>The choices made by  new entrants such as Merck, Glaxo Smith Kline (GSK), Lilly, CGSO and  NeuroPharma appear to follow a rich-get-richer pattern of inter-connections. In such a model, the probability of a new vertex  connecting to the existing vertices is uneven; it is more likely to be linked  to a vertex that already hosts a large number of connections  (<a href="#merton">Merton 1968</a>; <a href="#barabasi">Barabasi and Reka 1999</a>). Note  that two large biomedical firms, Aventis and Celltech, departed from this  model, linking with partners with scant diversity such as the UAH and Madrid's  most recently established biomedical university (URJC), suggesting the  existence of other connection mechanisms. To address these questions, information is required about the cast of  participants, their repertoire of activities and the sequences linking partners  and activities, none of which is available in the data studied here.</p>

<h2>Discussion and Conclusions </h2>

<p>This article reviewed  the formation of university-government-enterprise cooperation networks in three  bio-medical and physio-pharmacological domains in the Community of Madrid.  Social network analysis and data on the inter-institutional co-authorship  of documents appearing in the <em>Web of  Science</em> were used in the study.</p>

<p>Analysis techniques  were used to build and visualize the microstructure of the intraregional  cooperation network in the Community of Madrid. The mean degree values found  indicate that the number of connections grew in at least in two areas, despite  declines in density. The network structure was observed to rest on the public  universities, which showed the highest degree and betweenness values, while the  Complutense University of Madrid (UCM) was the central-most actor in all the  subject categories.</p>

<p>The universities  played a pivotal and crucial role in the establishment of cooperative networks  for scientific papers, very likely facilitating the flow of scientific and  technical information across the scientific communities in the three domains  studied. In fact, comparing the order of magnitude of the three centrality  measures, these graphs should be described as &ldquo;one-cluster network which  contains a <em>circle</em> involving a large  proportion of points in the network&rdquo; (<a href="#N32">Nakao 1990</a>: 13).</p>
  
  <p>Network evolution  showed an increase in links among participants, creating connections with other  centres working in similar areas, as can be seen in the mean closeness values  given in Table 3. This affords researchers opportunities to associate with  other knowledge centres and consequently to overcome <em>the distance</em> between  organizations working in the same subject category. A shorter distance  (=greater closeness) between organizations does not, naturally, mean a shorter  cognitive distance, but it may infer a higher potential for the pursuit of new  ideas.</p>

<p>In the networks  studied, node distribution appears to follow the cumulative advantage model  formulated by Price (<a href="#price">1965</a>), presently known as  preferential attachment. Here, the probability of a new node&rsquo;s connecting to  any of the existing nodes on the network is uneven, inasmuch as it is much more  likely to link up with a vertex that already hosts a large number of  connections (<a href="#barabasi">Barabasi and Albert 1999</a>). By associating with  the node that is already more heavily inter-connected than any other, new nodes  strengthen its role as the centre of the structure.</p>

<p>Analysing networks  similar to the ones shown here, a number of authors have suggested that the  clustering coefficient is an indicator of the existence of a subject-oriented  approach (see, e.g., <a href="#wagner">Wagner <em>et al.</em> 2005</a>). Higher clustering coefficients may denote the existence of  convergence around a technical solution, whereas low coefficients may reflect  several competing and changing objectives. So the decline in the clustering coefficient may evince varying and  competing focuses and approaches to the subject matter. </p>

<p>Although the scope of  this research was partial and preliminary, the study showed that university  researchers may play an essential role in establishing research and development  networks involving universities, industries and public sectors, thereby  furthering technological and institutional change in the Community of Madrid.  Nonetheless, cooperative network structures and organizations suggest that initiatives  should be taken to enable networking to contribute significantly to the  intensification of the establishment of links among the three sectors involved. </p>

<p>The study also showed  the possibility of applying quantitative as well as visualization and social  network analysis techniques to examine the cooperative structures linking  universities, private enterprise and government within a regional context of  innovation. At the same time, it introduces an approach to the analysis of  cooperative network dynamics in the fields studied. Although the survey was  limited to Madrid  and three sectors, a comparative study could be conducted to analyse the  similarities and differences with others Spanish autonomous communities (or regions); this study could also be enlarged to include data from the analysis  of research hospitals outputs, public bodies, projects or patents.</p>

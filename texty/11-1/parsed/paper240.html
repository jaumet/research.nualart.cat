<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>For a long time Swedish curricula have <span>emphasized</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>three basic skills: <span>reading</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>arithmetic</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Calling them <i>basic skills</i> means that they should be given first priority in <span>teaching</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Since the advent of the Internet there has been a discussion whether or not a fourth basic skill should be <span>added</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> This would be the ability to handle the great flow of information in our society. Rask (<a href="#ras">1999</a>) <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the concept of <i>the fourth basic skill</i> into the Swedish <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>system, and the research <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>used would be <i>information literacy</i>. The concept of <i>the fourth basic skill</i> was <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>accepted by Swedish teachers, but the road from accepting it to applying it seems to be long. Many teachers do not know how to teach the information-seeking skills associated with the Internet. Since there is a widespread myth that young people know everything about computers, some teachers just leave their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>alone at the computers. Another solution often seen with regards to younger <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is not letting them use the Internet at all. The problem many teachers mention is that they do not know where to start or what to do. One reason for this is that the Internet contains a lot of material we would prefer not to encounter.</p>

<p>The aim of this article is to discern the different skills necessary for seeking information on the Internet in educational settings in order to make it easier to develop the didactics of information-seeking on the Internet. Throughout the article there is an aim to give the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on using the Internet, and to show what they have found useful and difficult when working with information-seeking on the Internet.</p>

<h3>Related research</h3>

<h4>Different skills</h4>

<p>As long ago as the early 1990s, Eisenberg and Berkowitz (<a href="#eis">1990</a>) developed a widely-used approach to <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>information and technology skills which they called <i>Big6</i>. Like <i>the fourth basic skill</i> above, Eisenberg and Berkowitz call information literacy <i>an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>life skill</i>. The six steps in this approach are (1) task definition, (2) information-seeking <span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> (3) location and access, (4) use of information, (5) synthesis, and (6) evaluation. Each step also contains two sub-steps generally <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to as <i>the little twelve</i>. This is a <span>linear</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>model where the development starts at one step and continues to the next. Bilal (<a href="#bila">2002a</a>) suggests that the affective aspect, which Kuhlthau (<a href="#kuh">1993</a>) found to be important in the information-seeking process, should be incorporated into this model.</p>

<p>Related to this affective aspect is the research that Gross (<a href="#gro">2001</a>) conducted on what she calls imposed information-seeking. She found that many young <span>children</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>s research projects at <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were assigned to the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by the teacher, rather than being their own.</p>

<h4>More training and experience</h4>

<p>Research has often found that <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>do not always succeed very well when seeking information on the Internet. It is claimed that there is a need for <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and training for information literacy, since <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>often <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>experience (Bilal <a href="#bilb">2002b</a>; Bilal &amp; Kirby <a href="#bilc">2002</a>; Enochsson <a href="#enob">2001b</a>, <a href="#enod">2003</a>; Hultgren &amp; Limberg <a href="#hul">2003</a>; Schacter <em>et al.</em> <a href="#sch">1998</a>; Slone <a href="#slob">2003</a>; <span>Watson</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><a href="#wat">2001</a>). Such training would include a variety of skills such as Web experience and <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>access, structuring problems, understanding the process, and so on.</p>

<p>Slone (<a href="#sloa">2002</a>) found that there were similarities between inexperienced searchers of all ages. This was also noted by Bilal and Kirby (<a href="#bilc">2002</a>). Lack of experience often means <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of models of how the Internet works, and leads to less successful <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>results regardless of the age of the <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>seeking information. The <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in Enochsson's study (<a href="#enob">2001b</a>) also <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to their own <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of experience as a reason why they did not know how to do everything.</p>

<h4>Formulating questions</h4>

<p>Limberg and Alexandersson (<a href="#lim">2003</a>) have seen that their informants, 11-year-olds, adopt a fact-finding approach, which they found to be related to the character of the assignments. They claim that the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>should be able to formulate relevant <em>researchable</em> questions, which generate a variety of <span>explanations</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on which the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>could be obliged to form an opinion. The fact-finding approach is indirectly <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by the teachers, who are not always aware of the difference between questions that lead to fact-finding and those that are researchable (Enochsson <a href="#enoc">2002</a>).</p>

<h4>The teacher's role</h4>

<p>The teacher plays a <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>role in being a fellow creator who guides the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>so that they can develop and become participants in the learning environments of which <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is constituted. Bilal (<a href="#bilb">2002b</a>) also makes this comment.</p>

<h3>Research questions</h3>

<p>This paper is a <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to Dresang (<a href="#dre">1999</a>) in that research draws upon young <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>s own <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and the data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>situations of information seeking were at least informal, in the sense of not having been constructed for the benefit of the researcher. Their naturalistic character is open to question, however.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the aim of this study is to discern the skills necessary for seeking information on the Internet in educational settings and to give voice to the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on using the Internet. The following questions are asked:</p>

<ul>
<li>What skills do the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>claim are necessary to carry out a successful information-seeking process?</li>
<li>How can these skills be related to each other and to teaching?</li>

<h3>Theoretical framework</h3>

<p>The data are analyzed within a socio-cultural <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> which claims that knowledge is constructed and developed through communication with the <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> including people (e.g., Vygotsky <a href="#vyga">1986</a>). This <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>also views <span>children</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>s learning as similar to that of adults, though <span>children</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>s more <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>experience <span>naturally</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>plays a role (Vygotsky <a href="#vygb">1998</a>). What a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>learns is dependent on the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in a wide sense. That is, the context is not only <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or home, but also the form and content of <span>teaching</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The study takes a users' <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and the users in this study are the <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> The teachers' perspectives have been used to understand the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the classroom better and to triangulate the data. Gender and childhood are seen as cultural constructions and the participating <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> regardless of age, are treated as participating subjects and co-constructors of data (James &amp; Prout <a href="#jam">1997</a>).</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>The data on which this article is based were collected from 1998 to 2003 in four different <span>schools</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> with <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>from pre-school class to ninth grade in the Swedish compulsory <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>participating. In total 110 <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and interviewed, as shown in Table 1.</p>

<p>The <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were chosen because of the teachers' intentions to use computers as a natural tool in the classroom. Their <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was inquiry-based, and they all tried as much as possible to use the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> questions as starting points for their <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> which led to a natural need for information seeking in the classroom. All the teachers <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that it was possible for their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to acquire information-seeking skills, even if to varying degrees. The aim of the study was to understand what <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>do when they <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for information on the Internet at <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and how they <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on this when they are given the opportunity to work with it for a long <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and with good guidance. </p>

<p>The <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> access to computers varied from a few computers shared by several <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>labs where each student could sit at their own <span>computer</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The approach was ethnographic, which <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>various data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>methods, such as observation, interviews, conversations, questionnaires and examining written <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>logs. At one of the <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>there was also a reading-comprehension <span>test</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Different methods were used for triangulation of data (Hammersley &amp; Atkinson <a href="#ham">1995</a>), which is a way of validating; one method's strength can compensate for another method's weakness (Merriam <a href="#mer">1988</a>). What a student did in the classroom was compared with what he or she said in conversation, and also with the teacher's assessment of the student's ability. All the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and teachers read and commented on their own interviews. The teachers also read and commented on the results, and at <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>B the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>also commented on the results. All these activities were done in order to validate the results of the study, and both teachers and <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>can be seen as co-researchers in this respect.</p>

<p>In ethnographic studies it can be difficult for the informants to know what data the researcher will use. Children's and young people's more <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>life experience makes it even more difficult for them. This makes heavy demands on the researcher to be clear. The concept of <i>informed consent</i> is <span>complicated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>settings, and David <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#dav">2001</a>) talk about <i>educated consent</i>, since <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are taught to do what they are told.</p>

<p>Of course, the parents were informed and all gave their permission, but since the <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and teenagers were the participants, their wish to participate had to be respected in the first place. In all of the four <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>there were <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>who chose not to participate. In one, this caused a dilemma, since one boy's decision not to participate caused two other boys' dissociation from the study, as they were close friends. Dilemmas almost always <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>when doing research with <span>children</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Problems have to be <span>solved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and demand sensitivity on the part of the researcher.</p>

<p>The <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were mainly done from transcripts and notes taken from interviews and observations. The <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were partly made with the help of the <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>NUD*IST for <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>analyses, where <span>sentences</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>both from interviews and field notes were coded. Some <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were of <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>nature and based on selected material from the coded texts.  In ethnographic <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the material is read and reread several times and compared in different ways to see what themes will emerge. The categories found are of course a construction of the researcher, and since the first data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was done in 1998-1999, the categories have been revised in this last analysis. This was not done due to new <span>findings</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> but in order to construct a more functional structure. Other <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were strictly quantitative and compared data from coded <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>material with questionnaires and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>logs in a database sheet.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>In my research I have identified six different skills, which the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>point to as fundamental. The youngest <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>only on (1) language and (2) knowledge of technology, while the oldest <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>these skills as obvious and do not always mention them. These can be seen as basic skills, and are prerequisites for seeking information on the Internet. But there is always a need to develop them further. According to the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>it is also important to have (3) knowledge of different ways of information seeking, and (4) how <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines work. These skills are very closely connected to the Internet. (5) Setting goals and (6) being critical, are skills that are also useful <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the Internet, and can also be seen as skills needed for understanding when <i>not</i> to use the Internet.</p>

<h3>Language</h3>

<p>Communicating is an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>skill and fundamental for an interest in information-seeking on the whole. When seeking information on the Internet there is usually a need to master the written language. (Alexandersson &amp; Limberg <a href="#ale">2004</a>). Even seeking pictures needs a written keyword. <span>Language</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>itself is needed for communication and to <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and formulate questions about something you want to know.</p>

<p>At <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>A, with <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>from pre-school to grade 3, there had been a project the year before my study where the <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>had used the Internet for information-seeking (Jansson <em>et al.</em> <a href="#jan">2001</a>). It could be seen that even the youngest <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>appreciated doing Internet searches, but there was a <span>limit</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> which seemed to be connected with their <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>skills. In my material it was obvious that the <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>became interested in <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>when they saw the older ones working with the Internet and <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>interesting information, which they shared with their classmates. If a student could not read, the solution was to find a classmate who could, so that the student could be helped do what he or she wanted to.</p>

<p>The results of the reading-comprehension <span>test</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> which was conducted every year at this <span>school</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> showed that all grade 1 <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>had <span>reached</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>level corresponding to the average of grade 2. Before the start of the project this had never happened. The grade 1 <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>had been working with the Internet since pre-school class.</p>

<p>Reading is a prerequisite for seeking information on the Internet, but working with the Internet in seeking information can, in turn, motivate learning to read.</p>

<h3>Knowledge of the technology</h3>

<p>According to the curriculum of the Swedish comprehensive <span>school</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>science is no longer a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>subject as it was earlier, in the 1980s. The <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is now seen as a tool for learning other subjects. Use of a <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>therefore needs to be natural and 'transparent', and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>use is <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in that <span>direction</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>To the older <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the study, the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is already a natural tool, which they do not <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>upon very much. To the youngest <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>practice can be a problem. They are not always sure about how to get the cursor to <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the way they want, where the letters are placed on the keyboard, or how to open up a <span>program</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Among <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of all ages it has been obvious that knowledge of how the Internet is constructed has made it easier for them to understand that everything on the Internet is not always what it seems to be at first sight. Turkle (<a href="#tur">1984</a>) has shown that when Apple <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>'desktop' interface at the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the 1980s, computers opened up to a different category of users than before. It was no longer necessary to know <span>programming</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or have knowledge about the <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>technology. This is true in a sense, but my results also show that it is necessary to understand the technology enough to have an understanding of how the Internet system works, and the fact that anyone can put anything on the net (Enochsson <a href="#enob">2001b</a>).</p>

<p>As seen above, technology has several dimensions that have to be trained if information seeking on the Internet is to be developed in a successful way. My results show that <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>practice is important, and that some <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>have to be pushed in this respect. Among the younger <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>it was obvious that those who communicated through virtual communities or programs like MSN Messenger had a clearer picture of how the Internet system works, since through their activities they got a picture of how they and their friends could influence what they saw on the screen.</p>

<h3>Knowledge of different ways of seeking information</h3>

<p>Generally, the Internet might not always be the best alternative for <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>information. One of the teachers put it like this:</p>

<blockquote>Lisa (teacher grade 4): It's best when they have found it out themselves. When they have been sitting at the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>searching and searching without <span>finding</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><br />
For example, when we worked with the Detective Story about Sweden (Sverige-deckaren), when I didn't lead at all how they searched. They could <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>just as they wanted. Then we compared the answers they had found, what time it took, and where they found them. And they laughed a lot when they found out that they had been sitting for two hours searching on the Internet and making phone calls, when someone else just opened their desk lid and found the same facts in three seconds. Then it became an 'ah-ha!' experience.</blockquote>

<p>But she also wanted all <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to learn how to do Internet searches, so that it could be a real option. What Lisa did was to let all the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>find an answer to the same question by choosing their own way of searching. Through <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the classroom, the different answers and also the sources were compared. This way, her <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>developed knowledge about how different ways of seeking could work in different situations. The teachers in the other <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>did the same as Lisa, although to varying extents.</p>

<p>On the Internet it is possible to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for and find information in different ways. Apart from using <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines, which is obviously the most common way of searching among young <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> you can also <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by linked sites or through the address space if you know how an address is composed.</p>

<blockquote>Tanya (grade 4): You need to have www first and something after.</blockquote>

<p>Students with experience of information-seeking think in terms of how the <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>who has put the information on the Web might have thought. This is related to the most appropriate way to <span>search</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<blockquote>I: What do you need to know to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to find things?<br />
Frank (grade 9): Write, press the mouse (laughs)  / - - - / The people who put out their home pages write different key words to make it easier to find. Then you have to think about what they could have written. If you are looking for facts about Ethiopia, for example, it is not very difficult. Then you just have to write Ethiopia maybe &quot;+facts&quot;. But you just have to think like they have done, and <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of... write like them.</blockquote>

<h3>Knowledge of <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines</h3>

<p>If the <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for information through <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines such as Google and AltaVista, etc., it is easier if you know how to make a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>more specific by using 'search engine maths' (<a href="http://www.searchenginewatch.com/">Search Engine Watch</a>) or <span>Boolean</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>logic.</p>

<p>The <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>mention the use of addition, subtraction and quotation marks. They also suggested that <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>word with upper- or lower-case letters might have different <span>consequences</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> as might using the space bar.</p>

<blockquote>I: Could you explain what to do to someone who hasn't got very much knowledge about searching on the Internet?<br />

Ellie (grade 9): Well, first you go to a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engine, and then write what you want to find, preferably in lower-case letters, because it makes it wider. And if you want something... something more specific, then you can write a plus if you like, and then you can add quotation marks. But I don't really know why you do that, but...I've learnt to do that...<br />
/ - - -/<br />
E: You can also put minus if you want something not to come up. Because it's easy to end up at a lot of porno sites if you <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for bananas in Amazonas, for example. / - - - / So you get fewer sites if you put minus some stuff.<br />
I: What can you put minus to get rid of the porno sites?<br />
E: Well, &quot;-nude girls&quot; or something.</blockquote>

<p>Some <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>say that they do not know very much, but they understand that there is more to learn to improve their <span>technique</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Several <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>have favorites among the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines. They say that different <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines find interesting pages to different extents. How different <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines work is good to know, but not always easy to find out. <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that they work somewhat differently can help.</p>

<p>Some <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the ninth grade did not know 'search engine maths' very well. They had never been taught, but had to rely on help from their classmates. Some had learnt enough from friends, but not all of them. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>few <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in this class had been taught how to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for information on the Internet in lower grades. They said that it had been very useful, especially the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engine maths.</p>

<h3>Setting goals</h3>

<p>According to the <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> there is a great risk of ending up just surfing around and/or doing something else if it is too difficult to find material. Goals can look different and have different degrees of specification. To function they have to be sufficiently specific.</p>

<blockquote>
Alma (grade 4): It's good if you know <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>what to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for.<br />
I: What else do you need to know to find things?<br />
Christel (grade 9): I think it is to know what you are looking for. It's hard to know what you don't... You have to know what to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for. Because I've been looking for some things to write about in <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Sciences, and if I don't know what to look for, then I can't <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for anything. So I have to know myself what I'm going to do on the net.
</blockquote>

<p>The <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>constantly refer to 'interest' as fundamental for an easier information-seeking process. Alexandersson and Limberg (2004) also found that an interest in the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>task led to a greater understanding. At <span>school</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> projects are often seen as doing a job to please the teacher (Gross <a href="#gro">2001</a>). Some <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>can experience this kind of job as challenging, when they can find an interesting aspect of something the teacher has initiated. But that is not the common view (Enochsson <a href="#enob">2001b</a>).</p>

<h3>Being critical</h3>

<p>Different research <span>traditions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>have different <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the concept of 'critical thinking'. One definition is a complex ability where critical scrutinizing in a logical sense is <i>one</i> part, and emotional aspects, which include, for example, <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and standpoints, are another. Values and standpoints have already been mentioned, and I will point now at two other parts: what kind of Web pages to rely on and understanding different perspectives.</p>

<p>There is a <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>source critique, which consists of knowing what type of Web pages you can normally rely on. They can be governmental pages, pages belonging to <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>organizations, link sites from libraries, etc. Part of this <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>source critique is being suspicious of private home pages. <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>about what you are searching for is also <span>essential</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<blockquote>
Michaela (grade 9): You find out if it is a subject you know something about, then you see it quite quickly. At least if it is a page where there are a lot of facts that are not right, then you can see it quite quickly because you know something about it. But if it is a page with a few things that are not right, and there might not be very many, then it's very hard to find it out. It's very easy to buy everything and believe in it.
</blockquote>

<p>The younger <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>describe it in terms of 'checking if it is <span>reasonable</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>, 'to think for yourself' or 'ask the teacher if you are uncertain'. But it is not always easy, because you need experience to understand that something might be <span>wrong</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Understanding different perspectives is another part of critical thinking: to understand that there are other perspectives, that different standpoints can meet, and that none of the suggested answers has to be <span>wrong</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> but are different 0es of the same issue. The following quotation is an example of this:</p>

<blockquote>
Anthony (grade 4): There can be some problems, since you can see all pages all over the world, there will be problems. In Iran they have other <span>laws</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>[than in Sweden], for example women cannot have shorts outdoors, and then, so to <span>speak</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>..There are the same Web pages with women having shorts outdoors and so...
</blockquote>

<p>My results show that when the teacher has a clear goal in her <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and supports the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in developing critical thinking, things happen. At <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>A the first graders and the <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>graders had extra lessons where they talked and reflected about the reliability of the Internet. The lessons were studied during two periods in two consecutive semesters.; In the second semester there were significantly more <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>who <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>my questions about reliability on the net and Internet competence. All these <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were from grades one and three. Awareness was clearly increased in these grades, but not in grade two. At least how they talked about it. And since language has a role in development, this is extremely important.</p>

<p>Being critical bears a relationship to knowledge about how the Internet system works (Enochsson <a href="#enob">2001b</a>; <a href="#enoe">2005</a>). This holds for <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of all ages. As mentioned above, virtual communities and private chat programs like MSN Messenger work like gateways to understanding the system. Students who regularly use these <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>show greater reflection about the reliability of the net. Almost all of the older <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the study use these <span>applications</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> but there is a clear difference between the young users and the young non-users with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of reflection on reliability.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>Seeking information is a complex process, which demands knowledge and skills from various areas. At the same time it is important that these competencies are coordinated and form <i>one</i> <span>entity</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>1 shows a model where the different fields of competence are illustrated as radii from the centre of a spiral to its outer edge. As he or she gets older, the child moves from the centre and out, and also between the different fields of competence, which interact with each other and cannot be seen as <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>entities. The development is described as a spiral, which symbolizes the fact that the different areas and competencies are trained constantly and recurrently.</p>

<p>The model of the spider's Web is borrowed from Corsaro (<a href="#cor">1997</a>) who seeks to show that <span>children</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>s development can be seen from a reproductive view in contrast to a <span>linear</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>view with development stages. According to a reproductive view, <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>do not simply imitate or internalize the world around them, but participate in it and strive to <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and make sense of the adult world. This model describes well the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>explanations</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>about continuous training.</p>

<p>Compared to Eisenberg and Berkowitz' (<a href="#eis">1990</a>) model <i>Big 6</i>, there are almost the same skills <span>represented</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> But in <i>Big 6</i> language is not regarded as a part of the information seeking process. The reason for bringing it up here is that the <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>stress language as an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>skill. But it is also important to remember that there are specific <span>languages</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for each context, and in the information seeking process there is a certain way to use the language that has to be learned.</p>

<p>From evaluations of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>projects in the Swedish compulsory <span>school</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> we have seen that there is a risk that the time for collective conversations will diminish when <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>spend more time in front of the computers (Nissen <a href="#nis">2002</a>). This leads to diminishing prerequisites for learning and developing <i>the fourth basic skill</i>, that is, seeking, <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and scrutinizing information (Rask <a href="#ras">1999</a>).</p>

<p>In all the studies mentioned in the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of this article, the researchers advocate more training and practice, so that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>can become more skilful information seekers. <span>Knowledge</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>about <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines and different ways of searching are the skills most often mentioned. What the <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>talk about in addition to this is the importance of mastering language. Both formulating questions and problems and spelling correctly in <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines are necessary skills according to the <span>children</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Bilal (<a href="#bilb">2002b</a>) makes comments on misspellings and syntax, but this can also be seen as a problem of the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines. Bilal also suggests redesigning the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engine's interface. But there will always be words that are spelled quite similarly and knowing how to spell correctly must be trained even if <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines become more sensitive in this respect. From the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> point of view, language cannot be separated from the information-seeking process.</p>

<p>Knowing how to handle the technology is of course important when searching for information on the Internet. But knowledge about the system is also needed. Slone (<a href="#sloa">2002</a>) as well as Enochsson (<a href="#enoa">2001a</a>; <a href="#enob">2001b</a>) have highlighted the importance of having a model of the information system to become a successful information finder, which is well in <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with what the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>say.</p>

<p>One reason why teachers prefer to avoid information-seeking on the Internet is that there is so much unwanted information like pornography, racism, and violence on the net. The <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>also see this as a problem and stress the importance of learning how to handle it, since at least the older <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>think it is a Utopia to believe that filters can stop it.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>All the teachers in this study spent a lot of time reflecting together with the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the classroom. They all pointed to, and also let the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves discover, possibilities and problems. This was done by letting the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>work with information-seeking in <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with a great <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of time for discussion in the classroom. According to my results, this seems to be an important part of integrating the different skills into a single process. The teachers have to be attentive to all the different skills, but that does not mean that the different skills have to be trained separately. It is more important to train and practice in a meaningful context. Solomon (<a href="#sol">1994</a>) discussed the importance of context in a pre-Internet study.</p>

<p>An important comment <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of all ages make, is that it takes time to learn to seek information on the Internet, and sometimes it can be stressful. The older <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>say that it takes time to learn to become a skilful Internet searcher. More training and experience is also needed according to several researchers, as can be seen in the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of this article. The older <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>all know that <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>criticism</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is very important, but <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of time can lead to negligence. If you are interested in good marks, it can be better to read the books the teacher has already chosen <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of seeking the information on the Internet. The <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>also ask for guidance.</p>

<p>What this paper aims to show is young <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> view on seeking information on the Internet, mainly in <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>settings, and how this can be related to a non-linear model in contrast to a <span>linear</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>model where the development are seen as stages. Linear models are often the way practitioners are used to look at learning, even though educational research has advocated other models for a long time.  Compared to the space given to different skills in earlier research reports, it seems that the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in this study put a greater stress on basic language, basic <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>skills, and critical thinking. Maybe the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>has been too <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>engines, and it is time to look more closely at other aspects of the information-seeking process. </p>

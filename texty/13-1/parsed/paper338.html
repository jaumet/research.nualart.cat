<h2>The opportunity</h2>

<p>I was an unlikely candidate to be the <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>who would transform Canada's leading generalist sociology journal into an electronic open access format. Indeed, my initial reaction to the entire concept was alarmist. I first learned about open access in a mass e-mail from the <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) of Canada. If I remember correctly, the message arrived several years ago and solicited input from academics on the prospect that SSHRC would expect funded academics to <span>publish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in journals that provided readers with <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>electronic access to their content. Knowing a bit about the financially precarious nature of academic publishing in Canada I suspected that this requirement would devastate independent journals. Consequently, I forwarded the message to <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Nico Stehr, then the editor of the <em>Canadian Journal of Sociology/cahiers canadiens de sociologie</em>, expressing my <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and asking if he was aware of this development. He was not. </p>

<p>On the face of it, contacting <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Stehr was a bit presumptuous as I had no official standing with the journal. That said, by that time a series of factors had conspired to ensure that I had developed a consistent pattern of involvement with the <em>Canadian Journal of Sociology</em>. The office for the journal is located in my home department of sociology at the University of Alberta. One of the founding editors was <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Nico Stehr, who was also by far the most active <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in editing and managing the journal. He had <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>served as editor since the journal was <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in 1975. I became acquainted with <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Stehr in 1994 at the University of British Columbia, where he was a visiting fellow and I was a PhD student and also his research assistant. One of the other co-founders of the journal was <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Richard Ericson. Richard was my PhD supervisor, co-author and close friend. Beyond those personal <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>with the journal, by 2006 I had also published one article, a review essay and a few book reviews in the journal. I was also the journal's most active manuscript reviewer. Hence, despite my not having official standing I had developed an interest in, and persistent series of contacts with, the journal. It was in that context that I sent my unsolicited note to the editor to ask if he was aware of how open access threatened to destroy what he worked so hard to build.</p>

<p>By 2006 <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Stehr had retired from his Canadian academic <span>positions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and was living and working full-time in <span>Germany</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> He approached me in December of that year to ask if I would be willing to take-over as editor. There was <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>time pressure involved, as he wanted me to start effective January 1st. I was conflicted. My editorial experience at that time <span>consisted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of co-editing a book and also a special <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of the journal <em>Surveillance &amp; Society</em>, both of which provided me some <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>insights into the editing process. The job of editor seemed a nice fit with some of my strengths, in that I am well organized and like to try and strengthen the works of other scholars. I also have eclectic interests and am a fan of clear prose, which is not a bad trait for an editor. Nonetheless, I had no experience with the day-to-day running of a journal. Moreover, I was in the middle of my first sabbatical and was concerned about what would happen to my research and <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>plans if I became editor.</p>

<p>After thinking about the offer for a couple of days my first question to <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Stehr was whether the journal was financially viable. I feared that if I took over as editor and opened the books to discover that the finances were a disaster that my editorial legacy would consist of having to fold-up the publication. Thankfully, I was reassured that the journal's finances were in good shape. Today, those initial <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>about subscription revenues seems quite ironic given that I have subsequently <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>changes which effectively <span>eliminated</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that revenue stream. </p>

	<p>Encouraged by my friend Richard Ericson, I <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the position. What follows is an abridged account of my first year as editor. It aims to accomplish several things. It provides an opportunity to outline my rationale for making a number of changes, including the decision to make the journal entirely electronic and open access. As such, it is a kind of snapshot of some of the issues currently facing editors in the rapidly evolving field of academic publishing. Hence, I hope that my recollections might <span>prove</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>useful to other editors who are contemplating such a <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>or individuals interested in becoming an editor.</p>

<h2>The Canadian Journal of Sociology</h2>

<p>Thankfully, the journal I inherited was generally in good shape. The <em>Canadian Journal of Sociology</em> is an independent peer reviewed publication, and was originally constituted as a charitable organization in 1975. It is a generalist sociology journal, which, given the heterogeneous nature of the <span>discipline</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> means we receive submissions on an extremely diverse <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of topics. In addition to peer-reviewed articles we also <span>publish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>review essays and book reviews. We also have <em>Notes on society</em> and <em>Notes on the discipline</em> <span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>which are not peer-reviewed but provide a venue for shorter, more topical pieces.</p>

	<p>If we have a Canadian 'competitor' it would be the <em>Canadian Review of Sociology</em> (formerly the <em>Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology</em>) and one of the original justifications for creating the <em>Canadian Journal of Sociology</em> was to counter some of the geographic, substantive and theoretical biases that the original founders of our journal identified in the <em>Review</em>. Today, the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>distinction between the two journals is that the <em>Review</em> is an association journal and, as such, receives some funding from the Canadian Sociological Association. Members of the Association automatically receive an annual subscription to the <em>Review</em>, whereas up until 2008 they had to subscribe to the <em>Journal</em>. When I took over, our journal was funded from several sources, most notably a competitive grant from the SSHRC, subscription revenues and reprint fees.</p>

	<p>It is a testament to <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Stehr's hard work that the journal is recognized as a <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>publication, having published well-received and often reproduced works by some of the most <span>prominent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>sociologists in Canada and abroad. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that with an impact factor of .700 the journal ranks 34th of all sociology journals internationally. While this places the journal well below the dominant American venues, it does compare favourably to the <em>British Journal of Sociology</em> (1.00) which is the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>generalist sociology journal in the United Kingdom. The journal also ranks higher than a series of venerable American and European sociology journals (see Table 1) and higher than the <em>Canadian Review of Sociology</em>. While I am the first <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to question the value of such high-level indictors, it is nonetheless a notable achievement that a small independent generalist sociology journal run out of a Canadian prairie province would rank so highly; particularly in light of the enormous number of sociology journals now in publication.</p>

<p>In 2007 the journal was being published on a contract basis by the University of Toronto Press who also handled subscriptions and mailed the journal to subscribers. Published articles are included in the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>scholarly indexing services, and the entire run of manuscripts going back to 1975 is available electronically through aggregator services such as Project MUSE and Ebsco. Somewhat confusingly, when I became editor, there was also an electronic version of the journal which <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Stehr had the foresight to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in 1995 called the <em>Canadian Journal of Sociology Online</em>&mdash;a rarity in those early days of electronic publishing. This publication was edited by <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Jim Conley at Trent University and was entirely open access, publishing several original <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and a <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>number of book reviews.</p>

	<p>When I commenced, Joanne Milson was working part-time as the editorial assistant out of the journal's <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>office at the University of Alberta. She managed the submissions, finances and a host of other tasks <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to the smooth operation of the journal. Her process for managing submissions had evolved to the point that we would accept submissions as email attachments and would also coordinate reviews that way. The <span>rest</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of the process was, however, still done on paper and pencil. Joanne used large index cards to keep track of the <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>about a submission; who had been asked to review the piece, the date the review was due, and so on. This system worked, but the information was not readily available to the editor. Hence, one of the last messages <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Stehr sent me before he stepped down included the suggestion that I <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>adopting the <a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/?q=ojs" target="_blank">Open Journal System</a> which is produced out of Simon Fraser University. I suspect that he was recommending this as a way to handle submissions entirely electronically, but as I explored everything that the Open Journal System was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to accomplish the seeds were planted of making the journal entirely open access.</p>

<h2>Transformation</h2>

<p>In the first few months of 2007 I threw myself into learning more about the journal. One of the more disconcerting things I discovered was that many years ago our charitable <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>had lapsed. For the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of taxation, therefore, it was completely unclear what, if any, legal standing the journal had. I contacted numerous editors of Canadian journals for guidance. After <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>additional consultations with my departmental chair, university lawyers and risk assessors we <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that the journal was a University of Alberta entity&mdash;essentially recognizing the fact that it had been <span>founded</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>here and operated with university support for thirty-two years. Everyone also acknowledged that as editor it was within my purview to take the journal with me if I left for another institution and that I could hand it off to a successor at another university.</p>

	<p>The questions about governance structure highlighted the issue of oversight. Over a <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of many years the previous editor had become responsible for almost everything pertaining to the journal. Although he undoubtedly <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>out advice from colleagues, all decisions effectively flowed through him. While this arrangement appears to have worked fine for him, I wanted to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>a more formal oversight <span>mechanism</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>as I anticipated making several changes to the journal and was well aware of my inexperience. Towards that end I <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the Executive Board for the journal at the University of Alberta. It consists of five sociology colleagues who have diverse theoretical and methodological orientations and who generously agreed to serve in this capacity. We met for the first time in March 2007 and I have subsequently asked individual members for advice on a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of issues. </p>

	<p>Reassuringly, I learned that our subscription numbers were quite respectable. That said, there had nonetheless been a long-term decline in both individual and institutional subscriptions while the number of people accessing the journal electronically through library-provided subscriptions had <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to increase. Both of these trends would be <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to many editors. </p>

	<p>Adding to the general sense of transition, Joanne Milson informed me early in the year that she would be retiring. With her departure the journal had effectively seen a complete overhaul in its executive structure, <span>extending</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>all the way to the need for a new book review editor. As we interviewed candidates for the editorial assistant position I wanted to ensure that we hired someone with the technical skills that would allow us to make the journal more electronic if I chose to go in that <span>direction</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> That said, at this stage my understanding of everything entailed by open access was extremely rudimentary. Things came into greater <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in the coming weeks.</p>

	<p>In a 'back to the <span>future</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in the spring of 2007 I hired Laura Botsford as the new editorial assistant. Laura had been the editorial assistant for the journal from 1978 to 1990. In the interim she developed even more experience as an editorial assistant, had worked on open access journals, and become very technologically proficient. Equally importantly, she was a qualified copy editor. When I started in 2007, I learned that the copy editing of manuscripts was <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>left to individual authors, with some minor corrections being done by our publisher. Predictably, there was much to be desired in the published version of some papers. As the previous editorial assistant (Joanne) was not a copy editor I decided to rectify this <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>by throwing myself into the task. While I enjoy copy editing and had romantic images of scrupulously scratching-up each article, the time involved <span>proved</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to be enormous, and work on the journal was already cutting into many other things. It was a relief when Laura was able to <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>this responsibility.</p> 

	<p>As noted, I was also starting to more consciously weigh the pros and cons of making the journal open access&mdash;a process I found extremely frustrating. It was a big decision, and I was simply unaware of all of the implications of such a <span>move</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> To say I vacillated would be an understatement, often changing my mind during the course of a single <span>day</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> To try and clarify the issues involved in such a <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>I invited two colleagues (Pam Ryan and Denise Koufogiannakis) from the University of Alberta Libraries to advise Laura and me on the prospect of the journal going open access. Rather fortuitously, the University of Alberta Libraries is a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>supporter of open access publishing and <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>a journal hosting service <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>using Open Journal Systems. Laura and I, however, did not give our colleagues an easy time during the meeting, asking them a procession of difficult questions about the implications of such a <span>move</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> Looking back, it is evident that Pam and Denise could not have answered most of those questions to my satisfaction as the answers were contingent upon their having <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>knowledge about the specifics of the journal's finances and assorted institutional arrangements. I also suspect that what I really wanted from them was an <span>impossible</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>guarantee that the journal could accrue all of the benefits of going open access without also bearing the risks of such a <span>move</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

	<p>At their suggestion I attended a public lecture, organized by the University of Alberta Libraries, by John Willinsky on open access publishing. Unbeknownst to me at the time, <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Willinsky is one of the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><span>figures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in open access publishing (see <a href="#wil06">Willinsky 2006</a>) and his talk drew a large audience. During the course of his <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>it dawned on me that open access is not just something one might or might not do. Instead, it is a widespread social movement informed by the normative position that knowledge should be as widely accessible as possible. Notwithstanding that undeniably appealing sentiment, at the end of the talk I was still ambivalent. I was intrigued by many of the arguments, notably that open access could increase readership and the impact of the works published in the <em>Canadian Journal of Sociology</em>. At the same time, I was troubled by the flavour of the talk which leaned towards advocacy and as such tended to elide all of the tough questions I was wrestling with, most notably how to ensure the financial viability of an open access journal. After the talk I informed <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Willinsky that I was contemplating <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the journal in this <span>direction</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> and he was (predictably) very enthusiastic. I bought a copy of his book <a href="../reviews/revs202.html" target="_blank">The Access Principle</a> (2006) and started to read more widely on the <span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> Momentum was undeniably building in a particular <span>direction</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> but I <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to have reservations. </p>

	<p>To try and further clarify some of these issues I travelled to Toronto to meet the journals editor for our publisher, the University of Toronto Press (UTP). She accentuated the financial risks of such a <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and (also predictably) argued that open access would <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the death knell for our journal. As evidence of my continuing ability to vacillate on this <span>topic</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> even at this <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>date the last thing I said to her before we parted was that I <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to keep the journal with the Press and planned to make the journal one of their premier publications. The next time she heard from me was some weeks later when I asked her to immediately stop <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>subscription renewals for the journal as we would be leaving the Press, would no longer <span>publish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>a paper edition, and would be <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to an entirely open access format. She was taken aback and told me this was an uncorrectable mistake.</p> 

	<p>Notwithstanding a series of lingering anxieties, I was now persuaded of the benefits of open access publishing. It is also the case that making an <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>hard copy journal entirely electronic and open access is a big <span>move</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> and the risks of this <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>are born almost entirely by the editor. The largest anxiety concerned the financial implications of such a <span>move</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> When I first contemplated assuming the editorship I consulted with my colleague <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Jo-Anne Wallace who was then editor of the journal <em>English Studies in Canada</em>. Being a bit of a pessimist I asked her what was the most unpalatable aspect of being editor, and she replied: '<em>laying awake at night thinking about the journal's finances</em>'.  I laughed at the time, but the humour started to wane as I subsequently found myself lying awake worrying about our journal's finances. </p>

<p>Journals have survived by charging for access to their contents, which can take the form of subscription fees or increasingly fees from aggregators who then <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>libraries for exclusive electronic access to a package of journals. Going open access <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>eliminates most if not all of those revenues. However, it was always the case that most of our subscription revenues went to cover the costs associated with producing a print <span>volume</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> such as printing, subscription management and postage. When I sat down to try and <span>calculate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the bare minimum we needed to keep the journal running, those numbers boiled down to the salary of our editorial assistant and some funds to occasionally purchase new technology. The cost of office space was not an issue as the Department of Sociology very generously provides the journal with an office. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>competitive grant from the University of Alberta gives me one course <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>release to work on the journal. Scrutinizing my (admittedly rough) calculations I <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that we could survive on our SSHRC funding and decided that we would go open access. </p>

	<p>Several things now had to be resolved. It was apparent, for example, that we needed to clarify the <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <em>Canadian Journal of Sociology Online</em> before we could <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the print version of the journal towards open access. Hence, I consulted with <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Jim Conley who was editing that publication and had an obvious interest in these developments. At the most basic level, eliminating the print version of the journal&mdash;making it both electronic and completely open access&mdash;would mean that we would now have two online journals under the imprimatur of the <em>Canadian Journal of Sociology</em>. Hence, I proposed that we integrate the two publications, effectively wrapping-up the existing online version at the end of the year and starting to produce the other publication electronically for the first <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of 2008. Jim was enthusiastic and also generously agreed to serve as our new book review editor.</p>

	<p>The other issue which caused me sleepless nights concerned the aggregators. Those are the agencies such as Ebsco and Project MUSE who, on a contract basis, digitize our printed copy journal and then include those electronic articles in a package they sell to libraries. It is because of such agencies that patrons of subscribing libraries can get electronic access to the entire run of  <span>volumes</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of the journal going back to 1975. With open access the issue becomes what will happen to our arrangements with the aggregators given that the journal is now available <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to anyone with an internet connection? Financial con0erations are involved here, as aggregators pay the journal several thousand dollars a year to include us in their holdings. More importantly for me, however, is the fact that the back issues are <em>only</em> available electronically through such services. If they decided to effectively drop us from their holdings I feared that the previous <span>volumes</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>(all thirty-two years worth) would no longer be available electronically. While our journal holds the copyright for each article we <span>publish</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> the aggregators have incurred the costs involved in digitizing the older works, so they effectively own those digital copies and would therefore be unlikely to share them for <span>free</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> While we could digitize our back issues ourselves and post them at the journal's new site, doing so would be prohibitively costly and time-consuming.</p> 

	<p>Ultimately, I decided to <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>towards open access before those issues were resolved. In the interim I had learned that Google Scholar was wiling to digitize back issues of journals for <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and post them on the internet, again on the <span>condition</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that they would own the electronic copy. Such an arrangement would mimic our existing relationship with the aggregators, with the important proviso that after digitizing the text Google Scholar provides <em>free</em> electronic access to the articles. While this was not an ideal scenario, I approached it as a reassuring fall-back option. If we could not come to an agreement with the existing aggregators I envisioned <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>up the Google Scholar offer as a way to ensure the continuing electronic availability of our back issues.</p> 

	All of these changes now had to be publicized. In drafting an editorial for a forthcoming <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of the journal I carefully tried to outline and justify the changes, cognisant aware that this was a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>step in its transformation. Once these developments were announced there would be no opportunity to go back&mdash;certainly not without my looking like a fool. The editorial <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>several changes to the journal, including the use of a different academic <span>style</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> the new online submission management system, enhanced copy editing, new governance structure, and so on. The largest amount of space was dedicated to outlining and justifying the decision to drop the print version and go open access. The positive environmental implications of such a <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>were noted, as was the ability to <span>publish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>more book reviews in a more timely fashion. For me, however, the knock-down appeal of this change has always been that it would give works published in the journal a wider global audience and greater impact. When I had a clean draft of this document I send it to my friend and mentor Richard Ericson. I did so with some <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of trepidation, as he was one of the original founders of the journal and I was clearly <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>a risk with something he had helped to create. Thankfully, he was wildly supportive: '<em>You have convinced (even) me that open access is the way to go!</em>' His encouragement meant a lot to me, but today it is also tinged with <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>sadness as this was the last I ever heard from Richard who died tragically a short while later.

	<p>On a more pleasant note, Richard was not the only <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>who <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>this initiative. When the editorial was published (<a href="#hag07">Haggerty 2007</a>) I also sent a copy by e-mail to all of the sociology department chairs in Canada. The profile of the <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>was further enhanced when the Canadian academic magazine <em>University Affairs</em> ran a <span>prominent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>article on the changes to the journal (<a href="#tam07">Tamburri 2007</a>). Having taken the plunge I waited to see how my colleagues would react. Thankfully (and somewhat surprisingly) I have yet to receive a single missive from anyone who objected but have had a host of messages supporting the change. Two exchanges were perhaps most encouraging. The first was with <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>John Willinsky who praised our example as a model for other journals. It was a sentiment echoed in an email I received from <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Craig Calhoun who is currently the head of the <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Science Research Council (SSRC) in the United States, who noted that he <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and might use it as an example for his colleagues to emulate. </p>

<h2>Looking ahead</h2>

<p>As I write this we are <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>steps towards publishing our <a href="http://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/CJS/" target="_blank">first exclusively electronic issue</a> (see <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>1). The content for the first few issues is now set, and we are fortunate that they contain <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>from <span>prominent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>sociologists  which I hope will only add to the profile of the changes to the journal. Publishing the first electronic <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>brings one part of this process to a close, but a number of outstanding issues still need to be addressed.</p>

	<p>One matter that I have not yet been able to turn my <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the journal's associate editors. We are blessed with many excellent and dedicated associate editors who review manuscripts and provide informal input on the journal. However, without completely dropping the existing cohort, it is time to add a group of new associate editors as part of the overall process of renewal and rejuvenation. As I go forward on this front I will try to <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>at least five different interests. First, associate editors need to be <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>scholars who can provide sound judgement and guidance on manuscripts. Second, they have to be willing to <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>help out. As any editor will confirm, <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>willing (quality) reviewers is the most frustrating part of his or her job. This problem is compounded for a generalist sociology journal where the editor often has to seek out expertise from individuals who are not associate editors and whom they may not know personally. The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>criterion is that as a body the associate editors should <span>approximate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the various forms of diversity that now characterize our <span>discipline</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> Fourth, I am eager to include a younger cohort of individuals as associate editors as part of the process of rejuvenation, hopefully bringing a new generation of readers and contributors to the journal. Finally, by convention, some of these individuals will have to be <em>name</em> scholars in order to <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the journal's profile. This is something that is explicitly mandated by SSHRC's funding criteria, but it can sometimes be in tension with the aim of having associate editors who participate. Many <em>name</em> individuals with <span>prominent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>journals are just that, <span>names</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> who are minimally involved in the journal itself.</p>

	<p>Another development <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the fact that the <em>Canadian Journal of Sociology</em> is officially a bilingual journal, publishing works in both <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and French. In practice, however, in recent years we have not received many French submissions and published few French articles. I hope to rectify this <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and draw more French language submissions and readers to the journal. Towards that end I recently asked <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Daniel B&eacute;land (University of Saskatchewan) to be the editor responsible for French submissions and <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Elke Winter (Universit&eacute; d'Ottawa) to be the book review editor for French books. Both have graciously agreed to take on those responsibilities.</p>

	<p>At this date our relationship with the aggregators still remains unclear. We are talking with them about how to proceed in light of the the journal's open access <span>status</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> Happily, they seem interested in keeping the reconfigured journal in their stable of journals and might be willing to compensate us (a bit) to do so. The reason for this appears to be related to their <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>models. Aggregators want to have as comprehensive a package of journals as possible to present to libraries in order to demonstrate the <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of material that they index. From the library <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>it is this indexing which is key, as it allows patrons to discover specific journal content from everything else in the field. The aggregators' desire to have widespread coverage, combined with the comparatively high profile of the journal, appears to make them amenable to maintaining our journal as part of their holdings and compensating us for this fact.</p>

	<p>Now that the online journal will soon start to have real content, we must ensure that people can access this material. Individuals who use an internet <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>engine should have little <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>finding such articles, but what about library patrons who use a library system to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>for a specific article published in the new journal, or who do a subject <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>on a <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>covered in one of the articles? In order to ensure that they will be automatically directed to the new <em>Canadian Journal of Sociology</em> homepage we now need to contact all of our previous institutional subscribers and let them know about this change. Apparently librarians receive such notices on a <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>basis and update their catalogues accordingly. But how do we get the word out more widely? One of the most appealing aspects of open access is that it can provide scholarship with a global reach. In order to ensure that a librarian in Kenya or Argentina who perhaps previously could not afford a subscription to the journal or to JSTOR can add the <em>Canadian Journal of Sociology</em> to their <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of offerings we will be adding our journal to the <a href="http://www.doaj.org/" target="_blank">Directory of Open Access Journals
</a>. My librarian colleagues advise me that this is the best <span>mechanism</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to inform the global library <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>about this change.</p>

	<p>We must now also start to think about incorporating the works that were published in the previous incarnation of the <em>Canadian Journal of Sociology Online</em> into the new  homepage. Our plan is to copy the current content to a server at the University of Alberta and then have them linked to pages on the journal site. Always the optimist, Jim Conely reassures me that this should not be a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>undertaking.</p> 

	<p>Finally, looking ahead, the most consequential thing that I must do this year is apply for SSHRC funding. Our existing grant will soon end, and everything that we have done over the past twelve months has effectively involved a gamble that the journal will continue to receive funding from SSHRC. There are good reasons to believe that the funding application will be successful. The journal has a high profile and publishes <span>prominent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>works. Moreover, in the past few years SSHRC has emerged as a strong proponent of open access and the <em>Canadian Journal of Sociology</em> has become something of a <span>cause</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>celebre for open access publishing. If, however, I have dramatically misread developments at SSHRC, or if the winds of change push the funding agency itself on to the federal chopping block, then we could find ourselves in a crisis. At this stage there is no going back to a print journal. All of our eggs are effectively in one funding basket and it is not clear how we could generate <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>revenue to keep the journal running without SSHRC funding. </p>

<h2>Lessons learned </h2>

<p>Although I was not aware of it at the time, I suspect that one thing which predisposed me towards open access was my experience with the journal <a href="http://www.surveillance-and-society.org/" target="_blank">Surveillance &amp; Society</a>. One of my academic specializations is in surveillance studies and over the past few years I have been impressed with the work <span>Professor</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>David Murakami Wood (University of Newcastle) has done in <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and editing this electronic open access journal. It has published excellent pieces and, more than that, emerged as a hub around which a particular intellectual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>revolves. The successes of that venture undoubtedly informed my sense that open access was a viable option.</p> 

	<p>A different experience related to my surveillance studies persona <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><span>ultimately</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>tipped the <span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>towards making the journal open access. In June of 2007 I helped facilitate the week-long <em>Summer Seminar in Surveillance Studies</em> <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>at Queen's University (Kingston). I was one of several individuals who provided surveillance-related workshops, seminars and field trips to a group of approximately twenty-five graduate <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>from around the world. As I became acquainted with these exceptionally bright and accomplished <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>I was struck by their technological prowess and the informational and mediated <span>worlds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>they inhabit. They write <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>code, have their own blogs, are denizens (and critics) of the Facebook world, read electronic magazines, and are more up-to-date on technological developments than I will ever be. These <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>will comprise the next generation of scholars, and it dawned on me in a very <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>way that they increasingly expect academic works to be freely available. Barriers that restrict their ability to acquire information will only serve to <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>them elsewhere for more immediately available sources. Spending time with them made me realize that in the long <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the <em>Canadian Journal of Sociology</em> had to go open access or risk irrelevance.</p>

	<p>Many lessons have been learned along the way. One of the first is that while there is an appetite for open access publishing, editors are wrestling with the types of issues I detail above. An unanticipated consequence of publicizing our transformation is that I am often now consulted by colleagues on open access issues. As an advisor I suspect that I am infuriatingly inconclusive, inevitably stressing the benefits of open access, but at the same time noting that whether this is desirable for <em>your</em> particular journal <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>on your vision for the <span>future</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> but also upon the specifics of your contractual arrangements, subscriptions and cash flow. And while the devil is in the <span>details</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> it is also apparent that all of these things cannot be completely worked out in advance. Moving the journal to open access was a calculated risk, but it was still a plunge into the <span>unknown</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> I did not tie up every loose end or answer every lingering question before committing to the change, and if I had tried to do so I suspect that the change would never have occurred. </p>

	<p>Another lesson I have learned is one that has been learned repeatedly by administrators the world over: how invaluable it is to have dedicated assistance and support. This has come in several different forms. My editorial assistant, Laura Botsford, has been a blessing. While she is technically in my employment, she <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>her tasks with the vigour and commitment of someone who is involved in a collaborative venture. At the institutional level, I have been fortunate that the University of Alberta Libraries support open access as part of their <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>model. Their programmers and technicians have dedicated the time and <span>energy</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>necessary to help us switch to a new format. As further evidence of this commitment, in the past six months the University of Alberta Libraries hired Leah Vanderjagt. One of her <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>responsibilities is to assist the open access journals on campus and I have been lucky to have Leah to whom I can <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>all manner of idiosyncratic questions. Such support is certainly not the norm at other <span>universities</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 

	<p>Looked at differently, however, I have not been so much a beneficiary of good luck, but have capitalized on the type of infrastructure, priorities and culture that should characterize a <span>prominent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>research university. Repeatedly, I have heard anecdotes from editor colleagues who lament continually bumping up against an administration that does not recognize the importance of editing academic journals, and is consequently obtuse as to the need to provide even rudimentary support. The <span>exact</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>opposite has been the case at the University of Alberta. Everyone I have encountered recognizes the contribution made by <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>journals, and the centrality of editors in ensuring their success. Moreover, they are attuned to the prestige value that can come from having such journals housed at your institution. Wherever reasonably possible, my university has provided the types of support (financial, institutional, moral) required to run a journal. If I was at a lesser university where the value of research and publishing was not as highly regarded I suspect that such assistance would not be as forthcoming.</p>

	<p>All of that said, it would still have been tremendously easier to just start an entirely new electronic open access publication than make the transition from an existing print journal. Anyone who establishes a new open access journals does not have to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>with existing subscribers, publishers, aggregators, funding agencies, indexing services and other institutions. At the same time, our <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>has undeniable advantages. We have the imprimatur and history of an <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>publication that will make it easier (hopefully) for us to secure funding, <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>submissions and reviewers. <span>History</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> name recognition, reputation and impact factors are on our 0e whereas they are not available to an entirely new journal. </p>

	<p>Some of the more general lessons I have learned over the past twelve months <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>publishing and scholarship. Editing a journal is akin to running a small independent <span>business</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> Even with informal advisors and a formal Executive Board, it is still the case that every decision relating to the journal <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>still runs through me-from the big picture issues to the minutia of whether we should capitalize the word <em>Internet</em>. People continually ask how much time it takes to do this work. In my case the answer is <em>a tonne</em>. The more general answer is <em>it depends</em>. The time commitment is <span>ultimately</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>contingent on what an editor wants to accomplish. Maintaining the <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>quo can be time consuming, but with adequate support it should not be overwhelming. It was introducing changes that has eaten up an inordinate amount of time, one of the reasons I suspect that more journals have not yet moved in this <span>direction</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

	<p>The editorship has also taught me a good <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>abut my <span>discipline</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and my colleagues, both good and bad. I have been reminded of the harried existence of many academics, with many potential reviewers often indicating that they would love to help but are simply overwhelmed. Even in such an <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> however, many colleagues who have their own pressing research, administrative and family priorities have nonetheless been tremendously generous in donating their time and <span>energy</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

	<p>I have also been exposed to the unbelievably eclectic nature of sociology in a way that mitigates against the academic tendency to become an expert in an ever-more-narrow specialization. It has been fascinating to learn about fields I knew nothing about and to be <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to colleagues working on innovative projects. Over the past twelve months I have <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>a few more grey hairs and <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>a good amount of sleep. I have also met excellent scholars and generous colleagues. And while editing is often characterized as a thankless task, I have been thanked many times by individual contributors, the wider sociological <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and advocates for open access. What else could you hope for?</p>

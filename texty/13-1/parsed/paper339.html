<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A household is,</p> 

<blockquote>...a group of two or more related or unrelated people who usually re0e in the same dwelling, who <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves as a household, and who make common provision for food or other essentials for living; or a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>living in a dwelling who makes provision for his/her own food and other essentials for living, without combining with any other <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>.  (<a href="#abs02">Australian Bureau of Statistics 2002: 115</a>)</blockquote>

<p>By this definition a household includes, e.g., group houses, aged care facilities, single parent homes and <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>families.</p>

<p>The household, whatever its <span>composition</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> has been a place of information consumption and management since mankind first began living in caves. In the intervening years, both the technologies that mediate information and the information itself have undergone dramatic and <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>change. Cave walls gave way to clay tablets, then <span>papyrus</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>scrolls and paper, and now we have <span>electrons</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and pdf files. Naturalistic information, i.e., information emanating from the physical <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> including speech, has been supplemented by text messages, e-mails and <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>thrillers.</p>

<p>While much is known about the <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>household as a consumer of media and adopter of technologies, little is known about how the household, as a collectivity, processes and manages the information it receives each day; that is, about how the household operates as an information system.</p>

<p>Indeed, we have been unable to find any research on the household as an information system. An <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>search of academic databases and the internet over several years revealed 26,000 potentially relevant papers but none of these specifically addressed the household as an information system. However, several authors <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>this knowledge, primarily as a means of better understanding how a household adopts information and communications technologies. For example, <a href="#ven96">Venkatesh (1996: 51)</a> observes, '<em>for a thorough understanding of the household adoption and use of new information technologies, we need a theory of household behaviour and a theory of household interaction</em>'.</p>

<p>Ten years later Haddon notes:</p> 

<blockquote>...to understand both adoption and use [of information and communications technologies in the household] we need to appreciate the negotiation and <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>between household members and the politics of the home that lie behind conflicts and tensions on the one hand and the formation of areas of consensus on the other. (<a href="#had06">Haddon 2006</a> : 197)</blockquote>

<p>In the same vein, where models of household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>have been proposed, they tend to be directed towards understanding the place of technology in those <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><a href="#ven96">(Venkatesh 1996)</a> rather than the use and management of information <i>per se</i>.</p>

<p>Despite these and similar calls for an understanding of the household as an information system, little effort appears to have been applied to providing that understanding.</p>

<p>Yet one might ask what benefits one would <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>from such an understanding, apart from informing a theory of the adoption of information and communications technologies in households. Understanding household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is important, I believe, for several reasons. First, there is currently no theory or model for how or why a household processes and manages its information. Secondly, the household is one of many types of organization. Insights gained from understanding the information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of a household may be generalisable to other types of organization. Thirdly, a householder spends much of his or her time at home engaged in information-related activities; up to three hours a <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>according to the <a href="#abs98">Australian Bureau of Statistics (1998)</a>. Anecdotal evidence, not to mention our personal experiences, suggests that much of this time is spent processing and managing information and that these activities are too often frustrating and annoying for all <span>sorts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of reasons, which need to be <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>if we are to devise better ways of handling information (including through improved information and communications technologies) and minimising the loss of important information. Finally, we may discover that how a household processes and manages information is related to other aspects of a household, such as family dysfunction or the level of social isolation of a householder.</p>

<p>This article reports the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of an exploratory Australian study (conducted as part of a PhD <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of study) into the operation of the household as an information system. It outlines a theory of how and why the household, as a collectivity, processes (filters, uses, keeps and throws out) and manages (maintains and looks after) the information that flows into it each <span>day</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> irrespective of whether the information relates to the household or an individual householder: its 'household information <span>practices</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>. In doing so, the research looks at household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>from the <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of a householder.</p>

<p>We begin with a brief analysis of the context of household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>before outlining the methodology and methods used for this study. Then the information management challenge confronting a household is discussed and, finally, there is a statement of the theory of household information <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>Context of household information practices</h2>

<p>Household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>occur against a background, or structure, of a constantly changing context of information, information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services and society. Exploration, and hence our understanding, of each of these elements is well <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in the literature.</p>

<p>Our relation with, and the changing nature and quantity of, information is explored in various terms, for instance:</p>

<ul><li>the digital divide (e.g., <a href="#com01">Compaine 2001</a>; <a href="#fos00">Foster 2000</a>; <a href="#loa98">Loader 1998</a>)</li>
<li>information overload (e.g., <a href="#edm00">Edmunds &amp; Morris 2000</a>; <a href="#noy95">Noyes &amp; Thomas 1995</a>; <a href="#tid99">Tidline 1999</a>)</li>
<li>media consumption (e.g., <a href="#gre98">Green &amp; Davenport 1998</a>; <a href="#sch95">Schement &amp; Curtis 1995</a>; <a href="#sil94">Silverstone 1994</a>)</li>
<li>information behaviour (e.g., <a href="#bon98">Bonner <em>et al</em>. 1998</a>; <a href="#wil00">Wilson 2000</a>)</li>
<li>our information age (e.g., <a href="#fea00">Feather 2000</a>; <a href="#hob98">Hobart &amp; Schiffman 1998</a>)</li>
<li>information (and knowledge) management (e.g., <a href="#cho98">Choo 1998</a>; <a href="#dav97">Davenport &amp; Prusak 1997</a>)</li>
<li>personal information management (e.g., <a href="#whi96">Whittaker and Sidner 1996</a>;  the <a href="#kftf">Keeping Found Things Found</a> project)</li></ul>

<p>Information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services have been widely studied in terms of the technologies themselves and their development, adoption, domestication and social impact (e.g., <a href="#ave02">Avery &amp; Baker 2002</a>; <a href="#che98">Checkland &amp; Holwell 1998</a>; <a href="#obr99">O'Brien <em>et al</em>. 1999</a>; <a href="#ven96">Venkatesh 1996</a>).</p>

<p>The construction, maintenance and changing nature of society is the <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of various disciplines like sociology, anthropology and economics, each with its own <span>extensive</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> related literature (e.g., <a href="#ald77">Aldous 1977</a>; <a href="#abs05a">Australian Bureau of Statistics 2005a</a>; <a href="#bel73">Bell 1973</a>; <a href="#cas00">Castells 2000</a>; <a href="#dal68">Dalton 1968</a>; <a href="#dia98">Diamond 1998</a>; <a href="#dou96">Douglas &amp; Isherwood 1996</a>; <a href="#kee98">Keesing &amp; Strathern 1998</a>; <a href="#nar97">Narotzky 1997</a>; <a href="#web64">Weber 1964</a>).</p>

<p>This literature paints a picture of a constantly evolving and interacting structure or context that both affects households and is affected by them. The interactive process is akin to what <a href="#ven06">Venkatesh (2006: 194)</a> calls '<em>coevolution of the artefacts and the users</em>'.</p>

<h2>The research </h2>

<p>As mentioned in the Introduction, the aim of this research was to conduct an exploratory study into household information <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> In particular, the objective was to develop what  (<a href="#gre02">Gregor 2002</a>) calls a '<em>theory for understanding</em>' that would illuminate how and why household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>occur. (Gregor contends that there are five types of theory based upon their <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>purpose: '<em>(i) theory for analysing and describing, (ii) theory for understanding, (iii) theory for predicting, (iv) theory for <span>explaining</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and predicting, and (v) theory for <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>action</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></em>') At the same time, the theory was <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to provide a basis for further research and the development of more comprehensive theory.(<a href="#gre02">Gregor 2002: 2</a>)</p>
 
<h3>Methodology</h3>

<p>The dimensional analysis methodology of <a href="#sch91">Schatzman (1991)</a> was used for two reasons. First, it specifically seeks to identify the <em>all</em> that is involved in a phenomenon: the processes, activities, <span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> con0erations and motivations affecting household information <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> As such, it is ideal for exploring an unstudied or poorly <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>research area. Secondly, dimensional analysis comes from the interactionist theoretical <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>which places the actor (or householder in our case) firmly at the centre of analysis. This was con0ered <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>if the theory was to encompass the deeper matter of why information was processed and managed. One consequence of this approach is that the <span>terminology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the theory is that used by the householders, rather than that found in the literature.</p>

<p>In exploring a <span>phenomenon</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> dimensional analysis seeks to identify the <em>range</em> of behaviour and factors involved, not <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or normal behaviour. Data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and analysis <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>concurrently, facilitated by theoretical sampling: selecting subjects or participants because they are likely to inform the developing theory, not on the basis of representativeness or randomness. This allows potentially relevant behaviour and factors identified in one <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to be explored in the next and compared with later ones. During analysis, identified behaviour and factors are abstracted into concepts, grouped into integrating sub-dimensions and dimensions, and <span>ultimately</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>formed into a substantive theory. In this way, the theory emerges from the data and is contextualised through an integrating <span>perspective</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> For this research, the <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>that best accounted for the data was <em>living with information</em>.</p>

<p>Explication of the theory is structured by using Schatzman's <span>explanatory</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>matrix:</p>

<blockquote>An explanation, after all, tells a story about the relations among things or people and events. To tell a complex story, one must designate objects and events, state or imply some of their dimensions and properties. - that is, their attributes - provide some context for these, <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>condition</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or two for whatever <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>or <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is selected to be <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the story, and point to, or imply, one or more <span>consequences</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> To do all this, one needs at least one <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to select items for the story, create their relative salience, and <span>sequence</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>them. Thus, &quot;from&quot; <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> &quot;in&quot; context, &quot;under&quot; conditions, specified actions, &quot;with&quot; <span>consequences</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> frame the story in terms of an <span>explanatory</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>logic... (Schatzman 1991: 308)</blockquote>

<h3>Methods</h3>

<p>Data were collected in two ways: by questionnaire and interview.</p>

<p>Each householder interviewed (except one) first completed a questionnaire nominating which of the 190 types of information (<a href="#App1">Appendix 1</a>) and 70 types of information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services (<a href="#App2">Appendix 2</a>) commonly found in a household they used and how <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>they did so. (Information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services were con0ered important because of their role in mediating <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>between householders and information.) The questionnaire also collected basic demographics about the household and each householder. This was <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by a semi-structured, group interview with (where possible) all members of the household lasting 60-90 minutes. Interviews generally began with the question, 'Tell me what happens to information in your household' and went on to explore the theme for that household (identified through theoretical sampling) as well as issues arising during the interview.</p>

<p>Analysis of the questionnaires resulted in four rather crude, but useful, metrics. 'Information variety' and 'information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services variety', <span>respectively</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of information and types of information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services used in a household; 'information use' and 'information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services use' <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>how <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>each type was used in a household. Frequency of use of information was con0ered to be a proxy indicator for the amount of information processed by a household and its relative preponderance within the household. Use of information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services was con0ered a proxy for the relative importance of a technology or service in a household as both a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and mediator of information.</p>

<p>Interviews were transcribed and then analysed graphically using a graphic <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>application (<a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/" target="_blank">OmniGraffle</a>). This gave a rich-picture-like <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of each interview, its concepts and the information processes used along with their inter-relationships. Further graphics were used to consolidate concepts into sub-dimensions and dimensions and to explore alternative perspectives.</p>

<p>Dimensional analysis allows data to be collected from any <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Accordingly, the first household was selected because the householders were known to me and had previously told me that they had resolved the problem of information overload. Subsequent households were selected theoretically to explore emergent themes and issues, as well as different types of households, e.g., an aged care facility.</p>

<p>It quickly became clear that each household interviewed possessed a particular <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of factors that affected household information <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> e.g., household <span>composition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and/or disability and/or demographics. Each household also had largely similar <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of information-related behaviour. Because of this, development of concepts (conceptualisation), dimensions and theory was rapid. By the eighth household, theoretical saturation was firmly established; no new concepts were identified. Data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to confirm and densify the emergent theory and ceased after <span>sampling</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>eleven households with twenty-eight householders.</p>

<h2>The household information challenge</h2>

<p>If we are to understand how and why a household processes and manages its information, we need first to understand what its members (the householders) <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to be information. Then we need to understand the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and quantities of information <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and processed, i.e., the household information <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>The nature of information</h3>

<p>What is information? There is no simple answer. Machlup &amp; Mansfield (<a href="#mac83">1983</a>), for instance, identified and reviewed around forty different academic disciplines and fields dealing with information, each <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>claiming it as their own and defining it in their own terms. Holgate (<a href="#hol02">2002</a>) <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>about a dozen <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the concept of information and Capurro &amp; Hj&oslash;rland  <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>their review of the <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of information with the comment, 'There are many concepts of information, and they are embedded in more or less explicit theoretical structures' (<a href="#cap03">2003</a>: 396).</p>

<p>To overcome this <span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> each householder was required to employ his or her own view of what constituted information. Additionally, for the questionnaire, the concepts information (however defined) and information object were conflated. This approach was an acknowledgement that information is usually embedded in some object (an information object) and that this object is what is processed and managed by a householder. (The only exception to this is transient information: information (content) that has not been recorded or captured in an information object, e.g., live speech.) Accordingly, the <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of information types used in the questionnaire covered both transient and object-based information.</p>

<p>Analysis of the questionnaires and interviews revealed that, for all householders, information in the form of information objects was the centre of their information processing and management; as one householder commented '<em>...I have four filing cabinets in this household and they are jammed full <span>cause</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>I keep records of all this stuff</em>'. Thus, transient information, such as a television programme, might be converted to an object (videotape or DVD) for keeping and later enjoyment; appointments would be noted on a calendar for safekeeping and/or publication to other householders; and, notes of a public lecture would be carried around in a personal digital assistant (PDA) for easy access.</p>

<p>Further, householders overwhelmingly con0ered information to be something that was useful to them: by definition, if it wasn't useful, it wasn't information: '<em>Something useful</em>', noted a female householder. Such a simple and straightforward approach to the concept of information is not readily found in the literature on the nature of information.</p>

<p>Information then, for the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of a theory of household information <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> is information-as-object, as favoured by <a href="#buc91">Buckland (1991)</a> in his discussion of information. But these information objects must be useful to a householder.</p>

<h3> The information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></h3>

<p>If information is useful information objects, what are the objects that constitute a household's information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and what information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services are used to interact with that information? No clear picture of the information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of a (typical) household can be gauged from the literature. What measures are available are largely provided by national <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>agencies, but these are extremely <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and cover such things as time spent in specific information-related activities like watching television or <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#abs98">Australian Bureau of Statistics 1998</a>); the number of books published (<a href="#abs05b">Australian Bureau of Statistics 2005b</a>); and, the use and penetration of selected information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services in households (<a href="#abs06">Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006</a>). There is nothing (at least in Australia) on the quantity of junk mail, letters, newspapers, e-mail (just data transmission (<a href="#abs05c">Australian Bureau of Statistics 2005c</a>)), transaction receipts and so on entering, or found in, a household. In short, there are no data on the majority of the types of information, useful or otherwise, making their way into our homes every <span>day</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> whether <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for personal or household use. Thus, the questionnaire results provide the best picture of the information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of Australian households.</p>

<p>Analysis of the questionnaire responses revealed that within the same household, each householder reported different information and information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services variety. That is, they each had a different understanding of the information, information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services available in their household and each used a different sub-set of the total found in their household. Similarly, they each reported different levels of information and information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services use, each interacting with their sub-set  according to their own timelines. These results were also repeated at the household level: different households had different information and information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services variety and different levels of use.</p>

<p>Overall, this meant that the information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of each household was unique. Some environments were richly varied with <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>use while others were not. The most constrained <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>was that found in an aged care facility.</p>

<p>Setting a0e the aged care facility, there was no obvious <span>cause</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for the differences in variety and use, notwithstanding the small <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>size. Having young <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in a household seems to be one factor; income, <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>level, employment type and household location seem to be irrelevant. During the interviews, many of the householders <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>their own reason for these differences, primarily the interests of a householder and their personality. Further analysis confirmed this to be so. But this is only one dimension of the <em>all</em> that is involved in processing and managing information in a household.</p>

<h2>The theory of household information practices</h2>

<p>Analysis of the data reveals that household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>(processing and managing information in a household) consist of two enabling processes and nine dimensions of <span>action</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> In <span>combination</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> these processes and dimensions determine which householder will take <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of what information, how they will process and manage that information and how much the other householders will be involved. Thus, households do not manage information, individual householders do, either on their own behalf or on behalf of another member of the household.</p>

<h3>The enabling processes</h3>

<p>Figure 1 illustrates the basic process by which household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>emerge.

<p>Thus the two enabling processes are <em>taking charge</em> and <em>negotiating</em>.</p>

<h4>Taking charge</h4>

<p>An individual householder comes to take <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of information in one of three ways: by <span>assumption</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> by caring or by gap filling.</p>

<p>In <em>taking <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by assumption</em>, a householder assumes responsibility for processing and managing (and often using) selected information because that information is useful to them as an individual, that is, it fulfils a role for them personally. This is most clearly illustrated when householders takes <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of their personal information. Alternatively, the information may be associated with a role occupied by a householder and information processing and management is part of exercising that role, e.g., being 'wife' or 'owner' of the <span>computer</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> The husband in one household <span>observed</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> '<em>Well, [my wife] looks after a lot of social type information, whereas I take care of the financial...</em>'. To which one of the sons replied, '<em>It's an ethnic thing.</em>'</p>

<p><em>Taking <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by caring</em> <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>when a householder processes and manages information on behalf of another householder (or someone <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the household) who is unable to take <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of that information themself, e.g., a child, invalid parent, disabled or aged spouse.  Commented one woman:</p> 

<blockquote>
...I would rather [my husband who suffers from Multiple Sclerosis] concentrated on things he enjoyed doing more than worried about silly little you know the day-to-day stuff that causes stress if you find you can't <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on it for very long.
</blockquote>

<p><em>Taking <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by gap filling</em> <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>when a householder, who is not interested in the information, takes <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of it because no-one else will and the <span>consequences</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of not doing so are unacceptable to them. Thus, one householder may end up paying all the bills, not because they want to, but because it is important for them that the household continue receiving electricity, <span>gas</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and the phone service. So they take <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of, and pay, the bills rather than miss out on these utilities. One wife <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in relation to her gap filling: '<em>No, he's just being plain lazy [in not doing day-to-day information management]. It's a bit like he won't do the vacuum cleaning because he doesn't like the noise but does that mean to say that I like the noise? No!</em>' This way of <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>charge may also be associated with a particular role within a household.</p> 

<p>In these ways all the information flowing into a household is nominally processed and managed by someone in the household. Each responsible householder develops their own ways of processing and managing the information for which they take charge: their own individual information <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Often, these <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>involve more than one householder so creating <em>open</em> <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> as when the bill payer keeps the paid bill in someone else's filing cabinet. Just as usual though, individual information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>are <em>closed</em>, <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>only the responsible householder who can do whatever they like with the information.</p>

<p>When contemplating <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>charge of information in any way, a householder weighs up the nine dimensions of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to ensure that the value they <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>from <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>charge, i.e., a fulfilled role of information, is <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the effort of <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>charge.</p>

<h4>Negotiating</h4>

<p>Taking <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in any of these ways is not totally a unilateral action: a grab for power, exercise of authority or imposition of self-interest. Every endeavour to take <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is negotiated between the householders, be the endeavour related to a particular type of information or the chance to watch a favourite movie on television. Not all negotiations, however, are obvious or explicit. Many are tacit, often requiring the other householders to object to the proposed endeavour rather than specifically <span>agree</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to it. <span>Sometimes</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> non-negotiation-based techniques are used, e.g., one householder may get tired of processing and managing all the tax-related information and insist that the other householders look after their own:</p> 

<blockquote>So I just took [doing my husband's tax] on by default because I could do it quickly and <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and was used to it. But then it <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of got to a point where I said, "No, I'm jack of doing all of this. You should be doing some of it". And so we had a shift of responsibilities...</blockquote>

<p>Negotiations usually <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>whenever a problematic <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>arises, circumstances change or a trigger event happens within a household, e.g., a child leaves home, couples <span>separate</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> a new information-related device or service is <span>acquired</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> a favourite television show needs to be recorded. Through negotiation, such situations are resolved and routine information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>are <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for both the individual householders and the household as a collectivity.</p>

<p>By way of these negotiations, household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>emerge. In particular, they <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>a negotiated order: '<em>an informal structure ... in which the involved parties develop tacit agreements and unofficial arrangements that enable them to carry out their work</em>' (<a href="#day77">Day &amp; Day 1977: 130</a>). The negotiated order of household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>consists of the individual information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of each householder, the <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>between those <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and any rules <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>within a household for the maintenance of those <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> The process of <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and maintaining household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as a negotiated order is illustrated in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>2.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p339fig2.jpg" width="354" height="262" alt="<span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>2: Household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as a negotiated order" /></div>

<p>Over time, the negotiated order, and hence household information <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> change reflecting <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to more problematic situations, changes to the rules and changes in the context of household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>(information, information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services, and society).</p>

<p>According to <a href="#str78">Strauss (1978)</a>, a negotiation consists of three interacting components as illustrated in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>3. Central is the negotiation itself which includes all the transactions and <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>between the negotiators: doing deals, making compromises and the like. The negotiation structural context is the <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>context within which a negotiation occurs; it is generally external to the negotiation. And finally, the negotiation context is the set of factors that <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>affect a negotiation.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p339fig3.jpg" width="104" height="167" alt="<span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>3: Strauss's components of a negotiation" /></div>
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 3: Strauss's components of a negotiation</strong></div>

<p>In negotiating household information <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> the nine dimensions of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>contribute to these components as shown in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>4. Dimensions over which a householder generally has little control (influencer dimensions) are part of the negotiation structural context. Dimensions <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>affecting a householder (direct affect dimensions) constitute the narrower negotiation context, and individual information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>are the outcome of the negotiation. Sitting behind theses dimensions is the ever-present, constantly changing context of household information <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<div align="center"><img src="p339fig4.jpg" width="271" height="336" alt="<span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>4: The dimensions of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and the negotiation model" /></div>
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 4: The dimensions of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and the negotiation model</strong></div>

<p>As in <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>charge, each householder engaged in a negotiation con0ers all the dimensions of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>when deciding their position.</p>

<p>Of course, this analysis ignores issues like power within a household, negotiation skills and previous negotiations, all of which affect a negotiation. Such issues must also be con0ered when analysing and understanding a negotiation. However, they have been omitted here to highlight the place of the dimensions of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as a negotiated order.</p>

<h3>The dimensions of action</h3>

<p>Table 1 lists the nine dimensions of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for processing and managing information and their sub-dimensions as revealed from analysing the interviews and questionnaires. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>dimension, and its sub-dimensions, <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>factors, issues, circumstances (con0erations) taken into account by, or affecting, a householder when interacting with information. Hence, the designation <em>dimensions of action</em>. These dimensions <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the viewpoint of a householder coming to live with information as part of their daily life. Therefore, they include the impact on a householder of dealing with the daily flow of information.</p>

Relationships between 'Being a householder' and other dimensions are not shown as this dimension affects all the others except 'Con0erateness of information provider'. This latter dimension is <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the control of a household, but householders do attempt to influence information providers to make them more, or less, con0erate, e.g., by asking to be removed from mailing lists.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p339fig5.jpg" width="503" height="483" alt="<span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>5: Interactions between the dimensions of <span>action</span>" <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> /></div>
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 5: Interactions between the dimensions of action</strong></div>


<p>As noted above, these dimensions are con0ered by each householder when negotiating to take <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of information. Thus, the model portrayed in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>5 operates at the level of each householder, not the household. When it operates effectively it allows a householder to take <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of his/her information (personal or household-related) through individual information <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> When the system breaks down, or when the structural context changes too much or too quickly for a householder to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>(for instance, a new <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>comes without a floppy disc drive), information is <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and a householder must live without it, at least in the immediate <span>term</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>Individual information practices</h3>

<p>Despite the different information environments existing in households, each householder adopts a common process for dealing with information once they have assumed responsibility for it. What <span>differs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is the information to which the process is applied by each householder and the timing of activities within the process. This process, shown in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>6, incorporates all the dimensions of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and represents individual information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as an information system.</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p339fig6.jpg" width="642" height="827" alt="" /></div>
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 6: Individual information practices</strong></div>

<p>This system works as follows. Because information is meaningful or has value to a householder, the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of their individual information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is to identify, capture and use meaningful information. As information comes into a household it is filtered and sorted, acted upon as necessary, kept, organized and protected from loss. What is not needed is thrown out and relevant information is shared or given away. As appropriate, the accessibility of information is improved, either as part of filtering or during <span>storage</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and protection. From time to time information is <span>lost</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> leading to mitigating <span>action</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> according to the value and nature of the information <span>lost</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Where <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>information cannot be replaced or compensated for, or should a householder choose to go without information, they live without information and bear the <span>consequences</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of the loss. All these activities are driven by the need of a householder to fulfil a role for information, to make it meaningful in their life. Further, the activities are affected by the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of a householder ('Being a householder'), any disabilities suffered by a householder or the existence of a disabled householder within a household, the vicissitudes of life and the circumstances of a householder. Finally, changes in the background context are responded to leading to revised individual information <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>Characteristic household information practice mode</h3>

<p>Because each household has its own <span>dynamics</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> operation of the two enabling processes (taking <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and negotiating) and the nine dimensions of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>occurs differently in each household. Even so, a household has a characteric way in which it <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>its information <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> called its <em>characteristic household information practice mode</em>. This <span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is based on the allocation of responsibility for processing and managing household-related and personal information.</p>

<p>Four <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>have been identified:</p>

<ul><li>Caring: household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>revolve around <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>charge by caring. Processing and management of the personal information of a disabled or dependent householder is involved, along with household-related information for the whole household.</li>
<li>Co-managed: householders share responsibility for household-related information using a <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>charge by <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and gap filling. Each householder is responsible for their own personal information unless otherwise negotiated.</li>
<li>Controlled: one householder, in <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>charge by <span>assumption</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> exercises <span>prime</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>responsibility for processing and managing, at least, household-related information, through <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>charge by <span>assumption</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> This <span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is often displayed in a household having a dominant householder. Domination may be due to the householder's personality, their household role or some other aspect of 'Being a householder'. Personal information of other householders may also be <span>controlled</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></li>
<li>Independent: each householder is largely left to their own information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and control of household-related information is loosely exercised. This <span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>is <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of households comprised of independent householders, for instance, group households, single-person households and aged care facilities where the clients are able to process and manage their own information.</li></ul>

<h2>Information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>as meaningful action</h2>

<p>The discussion so far indicates that household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>are an emergent <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>representing a self-organizing information system. But why do these <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>emerge at all? Why do householders process and manage information?

<h3>Enabling the role of information</h3>

<p>Central to this Why? question is the role of information: the purpose to which it is put by a householder. As Brown &amp; Duguid note, </p>

<blockquote>The ends of information, after all, are human ends. The logic of information must <span>ultimately</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>be the logic of humanity. For all information's independence and extent, it is people, in their communities, organizations, and institutions, who <span>ultimately</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>decide what it all means and why it matters. (<a href="#bro00">Brown &amp; Duguid 2000: 18)</a>.</blockquote>

<p>For each householder a piece of information, as noted in Table 1, is used as a means (has the role) of:</p>

<ul><li>connecting generations;</li>
<li>experiencing life;</li>
<li>living your values;</li>
<li>managing life; and</li>
<li>not missing out.</ul>

<p>Which role the information <span>constitutes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span><span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on the dimension 'Being a householder', that is, it <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on what each householder wants to use the information for. Accordingly, the same information can have different <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for different householders and even different <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for the same householder at different times in their life.</p>

<p>Processing and managing information, in the form of individual information <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> is part and parcel of fulfilling the role of information. For instance, information cannot be used to manage life unless the relevant information is first identified and extracted from the daily inflow of information.</p>

<p>In the same way, meaningful <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>for information determine meaningful information which determines individual information <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> So, if a householder <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>being part of a <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>history, or has information they believe is historically important, that is, information with a role of 'Connecting <span>generations</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>, say, grandfather's diary, a spouse's <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>photographs</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> they are likely to filter this information from the daily inflow, keep it, protect it and improve its accessibility by organizing it.</p>

<p>Looked at another way, the individual information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>implemented are a measure of the relative usefulness for a householder of different types of information.</p>

<p>Ultimately, if a householder decides that they can live without information, affording it no role, they will centre their information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>on 'Going without information'. Such householders are rare. More common are those for whom the role 'Not missing out' manifests itself in information hoarding. These people value keeping information just in case it is needed some time in the <span>future</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Just knowing it is there is important. One householder <span>observed</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> '<em>I suppose I am a background hoarder of things, you know. I am not so good at tossing out things even when there is a good reason for them to be tossed out...</em>' Most householders are somewhere between these extremes.</p>

<h3>Negotiation as meaningful action</h3>

<p>As a negotiated order, household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>reflect the agreements between householders about who will do what with which information and how that is to be done. Negotiations (or <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>thereof) thus mediate within a household shared understandings of the role, and hence meaning and importance, of information for each householder. What is also negotiated, be0es individual information <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> are the relative priorities of those <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and meanings amongst all the householders. In short, the meaning of household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and individual information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>(the whys?) are socially constructed and maintained.</p>

<h2>Constructing household information practices</h2>

<p>Throughout the interviews, householders told stories about how they managed to extract meaning from their <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>with information. Often this required them to overcome their circumstances (represented by the context of household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and the influencer dimensions of action), and the <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>demands of other householders, as they came to live with information. What follows is two of those stories.</p>

<h3>Living your values</h3>

<p>The husband in Household 1 told how a desire to live his <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>permeates his individual information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and hence household information <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> (All quotations are from this householder.)</p>

<p>This householder made '<em>a decision earlier on in my life that you want to be able to leave the world at least as good and, if possible, you want to make a difference, a positive difference</em>'.</p>

<p>One way in which this decision was put into effect was to <span>limit</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the flow of information: '<em>There's two principles: one is that of information <span>density</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and the other one is that of relevance, to areas of interest</em>'. Consequently, household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>included:</p>
<ul>
<li>buying '<em>only one [news]paper a week</em>';</li>
<li>listening to '<em>high <span>density</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>radio, information dense radio</em>' and </li>
<li>using '<em>a newsletter or a magazine [which] gives you a denser information flow, a more comprehensive [coverage] than a newspaper</em>'.</li></ul>

<p>Because this householder was also politically active (to make a positive difference), he needed '<em>an information resource space on the specific areas of interest'.</em> So, '<em>I create paper files, hanging files and other files, related to particular areas of interest, and then use those when I need them</em>'. His preference for paper is because '<em>I was brought up in the paper age</em>' and, anyway, paper '<em>is portable, it's portable, it's <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>accessible, it's file-able later on</em>'. Preferring paper means that information-related technologies are not very important: '<em>We don't have to have the latest [technology]... I always think with new technology you let those who have got the money pay for the experiments</em>'. Accordingly, '<em>We don't regularly back up the hard drive</em>' as most of the important information is paper-based. But this paper is not protected in any way.</p>

<p>Concern for a better world also prompted him to try and preserve history by protecting a <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>photographs</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and other <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of '<em>historic value</em>'. This information, created by a friend, was being <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the Australian National Library for safe-keeping and <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>use.</p>

<p>For this householder, living with information means being able to use information to make the world a better place. In turn, this means controlling information overload to maximise the <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of information that supports this goal.</p>

<h3> Using the changing context of household information practices</h3>

<p>Household 10 illustrated how changes in the context of household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>can be deliberately used to change household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>to the benefit of one particular householder.</p>

<p>The father in this household had, many years ago, assumed control of the family <span>photographs</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>because he was interested in them. He took the photos, put them in an album, '<em>put dates and everything on the envelopes and all that</em>' (Daughter). Until recently that is, when the daughter bought a digital camera. Now responsibility is split between father and daughter, on the basis of the technology of the photograph. '<em>As she said, they are in two formats. And I normally take care of the paper-based ones</em>' (Father).</p>

<p>Introducing this new device was not negotiated; it resulted from a unilateral <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>by the daughter. In <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>charge of <span>photographs</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in this way she challenged the <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>negotiated order of household information <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> Not only did this challenge trigger a reappraisal of, and <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>in, household information <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> it also triggered her father to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>a similar <span>move</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> '<em>Well, I haven't bought a good camera yet&mdash;when I do, maybe I'll switch over totally to the digital format,,, It's still quite expensive</em>' (Father).</p>

<p>But the daughter does not support any further change to the negotiated order. '<em>There is no point in buying two digital cameras in the one family!</em>' (Daughter).</p>

<p>Her decision to buy her own digital camera was taken against the background of male domination of technology in the household: '<em>[Access to the computer] goes on gender then on age</em>' commented one of her brothers.</p>

<p>For her, living with information means being able to access and control information on her terms. It means breaking the bonds of sexism which, she <span>believes</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> constrain her access to technology. Until these bonds were broken, she con0ered her opportunity to fulfil any role for information to be <span>limited</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>are complex, ever-changing, often subtle and socially constructed. They emerge from the <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>of a householder with information, information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services, other householders and information providers. Interactions with information <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>the importance of that information to the householder. In turn, this importance is reflected in the operation of the enabling processes and the <span>calculus</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#sch91">Schatzman 1991:309</a>) performed on the dimensions of <span>action</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Household information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>thus constitute a negotiated human information system: an agreed way of ensuring that all the information entering a household is processed and managed according to the needs of each householder.</p>

<h2>Appendices</h2>
<strong>Note</strong>
<p><a name="appnote">I have been unable to find any agreed nomenclature to describe the types of information and information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services found in a household. Terms used in both appendices, therefore, are mine. The types, and the types of information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services, were identified through an audit of the information found in my own household. They generally relate to the subject of the information or its use. That these designations were not challenged by participants indicates that they were meaningful, if not <span>accurate</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Rather than present participants with long lists of different types of information and information-related <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and services, I chose to group the various types into categories. Because I could find no agreed categories I developed my own. To a large extent categorisation is <span>arbitrary</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span> My intent in categorising types was simply to make it easier for participants to complete the questionnaire and identify the types <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:117px 39px 117px 39px;position:relative;">.</span>and used in their household.</p>

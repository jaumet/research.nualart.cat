<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Information seeking and use has always been an <span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and important component of the theorizing in organization science about decision making, innovation, organizational sense-making, and knowledge creation. In general terms, we may say that organizations seek and use information in order to understand and enact their <span>worlds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#cho06">Choo 2006</a>). Information <span>constitutes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>what the organization 'knows' about its <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and its tasks, and thus creates a basis for <span>action</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> However, the link between information, knowledge, and agency is problematic and not well <span>understood</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>In this paper we introduce three case studies that highlight different aspects of the <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>between information and knowledge in organizations. The first case compares information seeking and use in the due diligence processes of a government department and a venture capital firm. The second case reveals the epistemic properties of information seeking in the preparation of country studies by the staff of a German bank. The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>case recollects the experience of large-scale information sharing among copier technicians of a multinational office products company. Our analysis of these cases leads us to conclude that organizations behave as <i>epistemic communities</i> in which <i>information-seeking</i> and <i>belief-forming</i> are closely interlaced. We <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the epistemic styles and information cultures of organizations, and examine how epistemic <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>influence the seeking and use of information.</p>

<h2>Case <span>Study</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>1. Due diligence process in two organizations</h2>

<p>Moldoveanu (<a href="#mol02">2002</a>) compared due diligence processes in a US-based venture capital firm and a Canadian government agency. Both processes evaluated the application for funding from the same start-up firm, Highline Inc. Both processes ended in approval decisions, albeit for different reasons. Highline Inc. was a private Canadian high-technology start-up company designing chips and <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>fixed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>broadband wireless access. Highline Inc. submitted the same <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>model, marketing plan, financial projections and technology strategy <span>map</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to both the government agency and the venture capital firm. The plan called for the development of a broadband wireless system that could offer Internet service providers and local telecommunication carriers with a <em>last-mile</em> infrastructure that would outperform existing technologies. Using data from well-known market research firms, Highline Inc. projected revenues of $10 million in the first 16 months of operation, rising to $500 annually in the fifth year. Highline Inc. was hoping to raise $15 million from venture capital firms and another $7.5 million from the federal agency. </p>

<p>Managers of the venture capital firm and the federal agency had their own sets of <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and theories, which <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>their working knowledge. They had proprietary information about the industry that Highline Inc. was targeting; knowledge of alternative <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>scenarios that would be compatible with the data from Highline Inc.; and intelligence about the sources on which Highline Inc. was basing its forecasts, but which may not be known to Highline Inc.  In addition, both organizations relied on information about comparable deals that each had done in the past, as well as the outcomes of those deals. </p>

<p>The federal agency had codified its knowledge about the outcomes of past dealings with high-tech start-ups in the form of a set of guidelines and rules of thumb that it used to evaluate the claims made by Highline Inc. managers. These guidelines were <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as irrefutable <span>axioms</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>during the due diligence process. The federal agency viewed the Highline Inc. <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>plan as data that either confirmed or disconfirmed its set of guidelines and heuristics (Figure 1).  Thus, if there was a disparity between the company's <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>model or sales projections and the federal agency's guidelines, then the decision to reject a particular claim (or to ask for a modification of the model in order to fit the guidelines) was automatic.  The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the federal agency's managers seemed to be the <i>justification</i> of the internally developed guidelines for regulating investment decisions:</p>

<blockquote>
The government agency displayed a prototypically justificationist approach to the due diligence process. Its model or theory was the set of internally derived guidelines about what <span>constitutes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>a viable opportunity. Only viable opportunities are to be approved. Once the opportunity passed an initial set of hurdles, the process of due diligence turned into one of <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>reasons for investing in the firm from among the data supplied by the company. The credibility of the data seemed to be taken for granted, possibly because of the desire to fund the company once the initial guidelines were met. (<a href="#mol02">Moldoveanu 2002</a>: 419)

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 1: Government agency due diligence process (adapted from <a href="#mol02">Moldoveanu 2002</a>)</strong></div>

<p>For the venture capital firm, the due diligence process started with the model derived from the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>plan presented by Highline Inc., treating it as the theory to be tested. The inquiry process searched for reasons against accepting the firm's <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>model. Testable implications of the model were <span>checked</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>against market data as well as private information from potential customers, competitors, and other members of the venture fund. Since Highline Inc.'s managers were making claims about their technology and the market, their own credibility was evaluated as part of the process. Extensive <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>checks were done using sources suggested by Highline Inc. managers as well as other sources. Negative references and discrepancies between the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>model and data collected were not assumed to be conclusive. Instead, Highline Inc.'s managers were asked to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to the discrepancies, and these comments and rebuttals were then used to revise the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>model, which was submitted again for critical <span>testing</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Both the evidence generated by the venture firm's own process and the claims and propositions by the start-up were regarded as fallible <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that were subjected to further <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>criticism</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Moldoveanu characterizes the venture firm's due diligence process as a <i>falsificationist</i> approach that focuses on seeking evidence against a particular model, <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that evidence as fallible, and looking for more information to support, challenge or qualify new observation <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(Figure 2).</p>

	<li>A <i>justificationist</i> organization holds its <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as being irrefutable and looks for evidence that supports its <span>beliefs</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> It might ignore information that contradicts its premises, or it might strengthen its theories in order to account for the contrary evidence. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>justificationist organization will rarely abandon its theory in favour of another. </li>

	<li>A <i>dogmatist</i> organization holds a belief for a reason (or a <span>chain</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of reasons) that is <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with absolute certainty, without the need for further <span>justification</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Thus the dogmatist might assert 'I just know it is so'. </li>

	<li>A <i>falsificationist</i> organization holds its <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>provisionally, in the absence of reasons against holding them, while looking for arguments against those <span>beliefs</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Its <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is directed at <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>evidence against a model, belief or theory. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>model or belief is robust when it has survived repeated attempts at refutation rather than the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to which it has been <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with different reasons for accepting it. Moreover, the falsificationist evaluates evidence as 'provisional' <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that may be challenged by information about other theories, or about the credibility of the sources involved. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Organizational epistemic styles</h2>

<p>The first case study <span>raises</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that if organizations (or organizational processes) may be characterized by distinctive epistemic styles, then these <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>constitute an important aspect of the information seeking context of organizations. Thus, the epistemic <span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>both shapes and is shaped by the information seeking and use <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that are part of the organization's belief-forming process. For a specific <span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> an organization chooses among <span>competing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>causal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>models through the belief <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy that it adopts. The <span>epistemological</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the organization&mdash;be it dogmatist, justificationist or some other approach&mdash;may be revealed in the organization's information seeking and use <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> particularly its deliberation and advocacy activities. For example, an organization that actively encourages vigorous <span>criticism</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of new proposals and theories, <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by a careful <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the model that has best survived the strenuous examination, may be said to pursue a falsificationist approach in its belief <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy. In contrast, an organization that avoids open dialogue and adheres to <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>precedents may be displaying a dogmatist or justificationist <span>style</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Justificationism is most closely associated with a rule-based view of organizations which sees knowledge as embedded in the rules and routines of organizations (<a href="#cye92">Cyert and March 1992</a> and <a href="#nel82">Nelson and Winter 1982</a>). Organizations with routines that cannot change even in the face of environmental forces that <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>change may be following a dogmatic or justificationist approach in belief <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>where 'the way we do things around here' cannot be challenged. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>dogmatic commitment to a set of <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>may lead to the organization ignoring new information from the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>altogether. On the other hand, a falsificationist approach to belief corroboration is more likely to incorporate new information into its beliefs&mdash;using these signals to reject or reinforce current <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>while at the same time con0ering their evidential authority.</p>

<h2>Case <span>Study</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>2. Country studies at a German bank</h2>

<p>Knorr-Centina and Preda (<a href="#kno01">2001</a>) examined the analysis of countries as 'epistemically rendered economic objects' in the Department of Eastern European <span>Development</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of one of the largest banks in <span>Germany</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The department <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the bank's <span>expansion</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of investments and sub0iaries in Eastern Europe by identifying new possibilities for further <span>expansion</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>prominent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>function of the department was conducting and providing studies of Eastern European 'countries' into which the bank had expanded after the <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>Berlin</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>Wall. These studies <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the investment decisions of the bank's management committee, and the department was seen as being of strategic importance, reporting <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to the CEO. These country studies were significant research projects: each study was about sixty to eighty pages and took months or longer to complete. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>country was <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by a <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>file and a cardboard file of papers. The files initially had a number of empty chapter <span>slots</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and titles that were standard across all country studies. These included <span>slots</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on the banking <span>laws</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the country being studied, the interbank market, the economic competition in the country, economic projects conducted there, strategy and <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>plans and a slot for a profit and loss statement. Mapping the country, then, meant assembling information on these topics.</p>

<p>Knorr-Centina and Preda (<a href="#kno01">2001</a>) highlighted a number of significant <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the epistemic approach used by the bank to construct these country studies (Table 1).

Thus, the <span>epistemology</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is <em>specular</em> in that observation is at a distance and a shared <em>sight</em> of a country (hence a <em>spectacle</em>) is constructed from the use of information and <span>tools</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The authors note that this epistemic approach contrasts with the intervening <span>epistemology</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of most natural sciences that manipulates materials in the <span>laboratory</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> sometimes based upon protocols, in order to extract from <span>laboratory</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><em>reactions</em> specific, knowledge-generative effects:</p>

<blockquote>Objectivity, in these cases, is not based on the stand-offish attitude of the social sciences, which suggests that only a 'blind', non-interfering strategy that lets <span>experimental</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>subjects do as they would in a 'natural' <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>leads to representationally <span>valid</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>results.

<p>A second <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is that of <i>the use of <em>impure</em> and heterogeneous data</i>. This also contrasts with the procedure of many natural sciences in which the <span>laboratory</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>itself is the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> For example, in molecular <span>biology</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> nearly all data result from internally processed materials and great care is taken against contaminants and pollutants in practically all steps of <span>laboratory</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>work, including protecting against the unwanted interference of the entities (viruses, bacteria) they are studying. Similarly, in high <span>energy</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>physics, <span>physicists</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>battle continuously against an overwhelming background of unwanted signals which were the re0ue of last year's or even last decade's work. In contrast, the specular <span>epistemology</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in the preparation of country studies shows few of those <span>concerns</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Knorr-Centina and Preda note that <em>'[o]ne appears hospitable and receptive towards all sources of information, provided the <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>produces</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>no outright lies (there are sanctions against someone planting <span>false</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>information).'</em> (<a href="#kno01">Knorr-Centina and Preda 2001</a>: 34)</p>

<p>Finally, there is what the authors labelled the <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of <i>perspectival validation</i>. This <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to how the authority of recognition of the research results rests with the information end-users who are higher ranking managers and sometimes clients of the firms that produce the results. Moreover, several managers and management levels were routinely involved in the studies, introducing frames of <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and perspectives that differed from those of the researchers, resulting in various forms of interference with the progress of the research. Here is one example:</p>

<blockquote>
During several briefings, the department head insisted that the profit and loss estimate for the planned sub0iary in country Y should be done after that done for country <span>X++</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> because 'they [the countries] resemble one another'. But country <span>X++</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>was the place were the bank had undertaken the costly [building] restoration, and it was more than unlikely that the bank would spend another US$12 million in country Y on a similar project. Recon0ering, the department's head said the profit and loss estimate should be modeled rather after one done five years earlier for another sub0iary, because the countries 'resembled each other' too. Finally, she decided that the <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>charge</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>should produce a mix of the two, because the bank's activities would be in the <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>very similar to those in the other two countries. (<a href="#kno01">Knorr-Centina and Preda 2001</a>:40)
</blockquote>

<p>The second case study <span>raises</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the question of how common are information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in organizations characterized by distantiated observation, dubious data <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and privileged perspectives. More generally, the case underscores two important <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of information behaviour in organizations: (1) organizations evolve their own culture of information seeking and use; (2) they accept a satisficing approach to truth-seeking, and an instrumental approach to information use.</p>

<h2>Culture of information seeking and use</h2>

<p>Organizations develop their own culture of information seeking and use, <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>values and norms about, for example, how <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the data should be, how much <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is necessary, what kind of editing and manipulation is permissible and so on.</p>

<p>The use of distantiated observation ('specular <span>epistemology</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>) and the acceptance of 'impure' data in the case suggests a <i>satisficing</i> approach (<a href="#sim97">Simon 1997</a>) where <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is satisfied with sufficiently good or acceptable results, without a requirement to maximize or optimize on <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>criteria such as <span>accuracy</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or <span>quality</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Information use is <i>instrumental</i> when the information is made to serve as the means to an end.  This may be more likely to <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>during perspectival validation, as in the country Y example above where managers <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the assembling and <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of information. Knorr-Centina and Preda provide an interesting example of satisficing in information seeking and use when they described how the bank tinkered and made do with incomplete, inconsistent information in order to arrive at a report that was 'good enough':</p>

<blockquote>
Moreover, there were clearly different understandings about what the 'interbank market' is. When a first report on that market was faxed in from the capital of country Y, it was called 'Three Interbank markets of [local currency name] in country Y' and had four parts, of about equal <span>length</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The first was 'the white market', then came 'the grey market', 'the black market' and 'out0e markets of [local currency name]'. Each was given a percentage estimate of the total market, as well as a <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>estimate. The working of each market was also described. When one of us noticed that the percentages <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>up to about 140 percent, a member of the department replied: 'We cannot change them, we have no better <span>figures</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> We have to take this, they have no value, of course, but... We can write &quot;gross estimate&quot; on the top.' Nonetheless, changes were <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>several times during draft preparations. First, the <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the black market (which was not only <span>statistical</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> but also procedural) was reduced, so that only one <span>sentence</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>acknowledging its existence remained in the final draft. The <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the grey market encountered the same treatment, although it survived for a longer <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in various drafts. Contradictory <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>were <span>eliminated</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>step by step. Having noticed that several descriptions coming from the representative office at the same time confirmed and denied the existence of <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>markets for securities, the department tried to tinker a coherent <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by asking for additional reports and, when these were not forthcoming, they simply <span>eliminated</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the contradictory passages. In addition, the final draft was edited so as to fit descriptions of interbank markets from previous studies. (<a href="#kno01">Knorr-Centina and Preda 2001</a>: 41-42)

<h2>Case study 3. The Eureka Project at Xerox</h2>

<p>The work of service technicians is vital to the photocopier <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of Xerox. Field service is an important point of contact between the firm and its customers, and a <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>means of maintaining customer satisfaction and brand loyalty. In the early 1980s, with a shortage of technicians, Xerox decided to use less skilled and experienced service staff by <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>towards <em>directive</em> repair and <span>adjustment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>procedures. Service instructions would be documented in the form of a decision tree, and technicians needed only be trained in using the documentation to be able to diagnose and repair machine <span>failure</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Xerox management did not believe that there was much value in what the technicians learned on their own in the field: it was more important to ensure that technicians <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the manual than to support them in creating new knowledge. (<a href="#bob02">Bobrow and 
Whalen 2002</a>)</p>

<p>Product engineers <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that all the important knowledge about the technical operation and failures of the copiers had been externalized and codified in the service manual. Diagnostic instructions in the manual were produced by inserting faults in the machines in a <span>laboratory</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and then recording the symptoms. Thus the <span>laboratory</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>was their information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> They had a <span>mental</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>model of the copier as an <span>abstract</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>machine whose operation could be described in engineering and <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>terms. Their role was to induce and <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>patterns of machine breakdowns in the <span>laboratory</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and codify repair actions in the manual.</p>

<p>Scientists at PARC had a strong background in artificial intelligence, and they initially built an expert system to support service repair work based on the documentation. When shown the system, the technicians were politely impressed but did not think it would be useful in the field (<a href="#bob02">Bobrow and Whalen 2002</a>). (As discovered later, service technicians <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>encountered machine problems in the field that were not covered in the manual. They had to invent new <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on the spot, through intuition, improvisation, trial-and-error.) Surprised by the <span>response</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> PARC scientists decided to <span>observe</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>what service technicians <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>did in the field by accompanying them on their service calls.</p>

<p>Their ethnographic study found that technicians carried two sets of books with them: an official repair manual that was usually in pristine condition; and a personal notebook that was worn and dog-eared. Technicians seemed to spend a lot of time talking to each other (in the caf&eacute;, near the parts depot, over their two-way radios). Initially, this behaviour raised a number of <span>concerns</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Were technicians ignoring or bypassing official manuals? Was too much time spent in small talk? <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>closer analysis revealed that technicians were <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>down in their notebooks the <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>they had discovered to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>with hard problems that were not in the official manuals. The technicians took pride in their work, especially in <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>problems that have stumped their peers. Whenever they got together they would tell stories of the problems they had run into where the answers were not documented. Unfortunately, while these war stories might get told to the ten people around the <span>water</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>cooler, they would not get shared among the 20,000 service technicians that Xerox had worldwide. What was needed was a way to share these stories and discoveries quickly, so that when someone found a solution, it would soon be available to the <span>rest</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of the technicians. </p>

<p>To fill this need, Xerox scientists, together with the service technicians and engineers, developed a community-based <span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of 'knowledge sharing', which they called Eureka (<a href="#bob02">Bobrow and Whalen 2002</a>). Eureka worked as follows: technicians who had found new ways of <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>difficult repair problems would submit their <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to a pending tips database. Pending tips were vetted by validators, senior field technicians who were recognized as experts for those particular products. Technicians enjoyed the validation process as having an interesting conversation with a respected peer who shared a deep understanding of the machine in question. After validation, a tip entered <span>formally</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>into the 'knowledge base' where it would be viewed by everyone who subscribed to that product database. Names of authors and validators were displayed with each tip. When a technician tried to use a tip, he was asked to vote on whether it helped.</p>

<p>Eureka was deployed in France in 1995, Canada in 1996, and the USA in 1998. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>recent report indicated that 15,000 customers service technicians are active users with more than 15,000 tips in the database (<a href="#bob02">Bobrow and Whalen 2002</a>). The use of Eureka resulted in 10% <span>reduction</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in service time and parts used, as well as fewer long or broken calls, increasing customer satisfaction. But perhaps the most important result of the Eureka project was the change in the organization's <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>about the nature of field service work. The initial belief was that there was not much value in what technicians learned on their own in the field, and that all knowledge about repairs could be extracted in the <span>laboratory</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and documented. Through a series of unconventional interventions, Eureka revised these <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to the new understanding that technicians were discovering useful knowledge in the field that was key to improving customer service, and that this new knowledge needed to be shared quickly and broadly.</p>

<h2>Epistemic contests</h2>

<p>The Eureka experience suggests that organizations are arenas where epistemic styles and perspectives collide. For the <i>managers</i>, their epistemic <span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is based on introspection, vicarious learning, and personal <span>beliefs</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Moreover, there is a social expectation for managers to be confident, consistent, and to be able to reduce uncertainty so that timely <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is possible.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>consequence may be that managers are predisposed to a justificationist or dogmatist <span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that favours <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>reasons for maintaining their <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>over seeking contradictory evidence that <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>them to question their assumptions. For the <i>engineers</i>, their epistemic <span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>relies on measurement,  experiments, <span>testing</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> analysis and diagnosis&mdash;an <span>empiricism</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that is part of their professional training. For service <i>technicians</i>, their epistemic stance is pragmatic, focusing on what works in the field, without <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>knowing the reasons why something does or does not work. Their <span>epistemology</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is based on trial-and-error, improvisation&mdash;a form of cognition-in-the-wild. For the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and social <i>scientists</i>, their epistemic approach applies an open-minded inquiry that involved noticing and confronting breakdowns of their assumptions and <span>beliefs</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and designing new interventions that would allow them to re-perceive the world differently. Their approach is thus closer to falsificationism: holding <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>provisionally, while looking for reasons that refute them.</p>

<p>Given these divergent styles and perspectives, how are organizations able to learn collectively?  How can they develop new understandings and initiate innovative action? The Eureka case suggests that there may be a role for epistemic change agents who are able to negotiate the boundaries that divide knowledge communities in an organization. The PARC scientists acted as epistemic boundary spanners who worked closely with individual technicians and managers to reveal the importance of information sharing in field service work. Eureka was jointly developed with the help of technicians and managers who acted as local champions, trainers, and executive sponsors. Through progressively <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>scale projects, quantitative and <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>evidence was collected to demonstrate the use and usefulness of the system. Eureka was rolled out in stages, starting in the more supportive environments in France and Canada, before its <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in the USA. In recognition of the project's unexpected success, one <span>scientist</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>received a plaque captioned '<em>Despite the <span>resistance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of Worldwide Customer Service</em>', admitting the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of support from the corporate service organization during the project.</p>

Whereas many theories of <span>justified</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>belief <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on logical or probabilistic relations between evidence and hypothesis, naturalistic theories <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>processes causally responsible for the belief. Goldman (<a href="#gol99">1999</a>) argues that a belief can be <span>justified</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>only if it is generated by belief-forming (cognitive) processes that have the <span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>capability to arrive at true or correct answers to questions of interest.

Naturalistic <span>epistemology</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>is not confined to individual agents, it can also study communities of agents, when it must analyze the impact of social <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or social influences on the attainment of <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>ends.</p>

<p>If organizations are defined by and act on their <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>about identity and agency, and if these <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are based on some form of evidential support, then we may <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that organizations are <i>epistemic communities</i>. Such communities would be characterized by their explicit or implicit methods of belief-forming and belief-testing. The <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>epistemic communities was proposed by Haas (<a href="#haa92">1992</a>) in his work on how new policies were developed by government agencies (in the areas of monetary reform or environmental protection, for example). For Haas, an epistemic <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>would share (1) norms and <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that provide a rationale for social action; (2) <span>causal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>about policy actions and outcomes; (3) criteria for evaluating information; and (4) professional <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for problem <span>solving</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

Although perfect reliability is not required, we should be mindful of the limitations and vulnerabilities of the belief-forming methods that are commonly <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in organizations. For example, many organizational processes seem to favour justificationist <span>approaches</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Justificationist <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>based on rule-following provide control and consistency, but they can also encumber new learning. Falsificationist <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are thought to be more open and <span>rigorous</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#mol02">Moldoveanu 2002</a>), but the process can be time-consuming and demands a relatively high level of <span>discipline</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> We need more research that examines the belief-forming processes of organizations. What counts as evidence? What happens to signals and information that contradict existing beliefs? How do decision rules and premises act as organizational models and theories? What are the organizational defenses that obstruct open and critical self-examination?</p>

<h3>Organizations as cultures of information seeking and use</h3>

<p>While there is substantial research on how the culture of an organization shapes the general behaviour of its participants (<a href="#mar01">Martin 2001</a>), very little has been done to examine the impact of organizational culture on information behaviour. In our discussion here, we may refer to those aspects of an organization's <span>values</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> norms, and <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that influence the seeking, evaluation and use of information as <em>information culture</em> (<a href="#cho06">Choo 2006</a>). Values are the deeply <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>beliefs about organizational identity and agency, including the role and <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of information and information work. Norms are based on <span>values</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> but have a more <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>impact on information behaviour. Norms are rules or socially <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>conventions about what is normal or <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>behaviour in an organization. Thus, an organization may have norms or expectations about how much effort to put in seeking information, about the acceptability of using information for personal advantage, about the authority and authenticity of particular sources, and so on. Practices are repeated patterns of behaviour that affirm organizational <span>roles</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> structures, and forms of <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Information <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are revealed in the activities by which people find, use and share information to do their work and sustain their identities.</p>

<p>The link between norms and information behaviour is made clear in the analysis of the social and cultural context of information seeking developed by Chatman. Drawing upon her studies of the information behaviour of the working poor, elderly women, prison inmates, and others, Chatman proposes a theory of Normative Behaviour:</p> 

<blockquote>Normative behavior is that behaviour which is viewed by inhabitants of a social world as most appropriate for that particular context. Essentially driven by mores and norms, normative behavior provides a predictable, routine, and manageable approach to everyday reality. Aspects of interest are those things which serve to legitimize and justify <span>values</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> which embody social existence." (<a href="#cha00">Chatman 2000</a>: 13)</blockquote>

<p>Chatman's analysis may be <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to the social <span>worlds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of organizational actors. Chatman's theory is built on four concepts: social norms, worldview, social types, and information behaviour. <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>norms create standards to judge what is right or <span>wrong</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in social appearances. Norms give people a way to gauge what is normal in a specific context and at a specific time: they point the way to acceptable standards and <span>codes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of behaviour. Worldview is a collective <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by members of a social world regarding those things that are deemed important and unimportant. Worldview provides a collective approach to assess the importance of information. <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>types are <em>'the absolute <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>given to members of a social world'</em>. They classify persons and in doing so <em>'members of a small world have sensible clues to the ways in which to behave, converse, and share information'.</em> (<a href="#cha00">Chatman 2000</a>: 12)</p>

<p>The <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>research of Marchand <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#mar01">2001</a>) identifies six types of information behaviour and <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that can predict an organization's capacity to use information effectively. These <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are: Integrity (using information in a trustful and principled way); Transparency (openness and reporting of 
errors); Control (availability of information about performance); Sharing; Proactiveness (seeking and using new information to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>quickly to change); and Formality (use and trust of formal and informal sources). In their case study of a large law firm, Choo<em> et al.</em> (<a href="#choIP">2007</a>) found that the <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of sharing, proactiveness, transparency and integrity were significant factors in <span>explaining</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>information use outcomes.</p>

<p>More research is necessary to articulate the concept of information culture, and to <span>observe</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>how an organization's infomation culture can alter information behaviour. We would be interested to know if, for example, an information culture vested with <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of vigilance, openness, and trust would encourage open inquiry and learning. Information culture <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>needs to be con0ered at multiple levels. At the level of the organizaton, we might <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>how information norms and <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are specified by the rules and routines that determine what information is needed, what sources to use, and what information to attend to. To what <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>does the structuring of <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and decision making activities in an organization sanction a particular set of information standards and expectations? At the level of the group and indvidual, information seeking and use are the learned outcomes of professional training, peer influence, and individual experience. To what <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>do professional and group identities instill a view of the world that selects salience and <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in the information encountered? The research of Marchand and others is tantalizing in suggesting the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that a <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as complex as information culture may be described parsimoniously by a small number of dimensions and <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>that have a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>effect on information behaviour and outcomes.</p>

<h3>Organizations as arenas of contest, cooperation and change</h3>

<p>Organizations are made up of disparate groups with contrasting epistemic styles and <span>traditions</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> This is natural and necessary, since organizations exist as social arenas for groups to combine and coordinate their knowledge. At the same time, it is common for certain epistemic <span>positions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>to become privileged by <span>virtue</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of organizational power or authority, and for epistemic territories to become the locus of entrenched interests and <span>beliefs</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Given this diversity and the tendency for epistemic isolationism, how then can organizations learn&mdash;how can groups revise <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and develop shared understandings that enable collective action? How might boundaries that impede new learning be navigated? Our Eureka case study found that an alliance of scientists, technicians and managers was able to induce the epistemic change that led to new organizational <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>about the value of front <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>work and the importance of information sharing. Is radical organizational learning stimulated by individuals or groups who act as epistemic change agents: agents who create the kind of information and insight that <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the organization to reflexively examine its methods of knowing? We know little about this aspect of information use in support of new learning. We do know that a number of communication <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are pivotal in the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and evaluation of new information: boundary spanners, devil's advocates, early adopters, gatekeepers, opinion leaders, and so on. Do these well-known communication <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>also serve an epistemic function? What other epistemic <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>might we <span>observe</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>in an organization? What are the implications for information services and information practice?</p>

	<li>using the information (research, policies, procedures, standards) as a knowledge translator to explain to the nurses how it applies to their practice; and</li>
	<li>intervening actively as a change champion with just-in-time <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> change initiatives, and ongoing coaching. (<a href="#mac05">Macintosh-Murray and Choo 2005</a>: 1343)</li>

<p>We have so far con0ered the <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of individuals or groups, but what might be said about the effects of the information itself? Are there for example, certain forms or types of information that can facilitate the sharing of meaning and knowledge between epistemic groups? Bowker and Star (<a href="#bow99">1999</a>) describe <i>boundary objects</i> as those information objects that both inhabit several communities of practice and satisfy the informational requirements of each of them. In working practice, they are objects that are able to travel across borders and <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>some <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>identity. This is <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>by allowing the objects to be weakly structured in common use, while imposing stronger structures in tailored use at individual sites. They are thus both ambiguous and constant; and they may be <span>abstract</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>or <span>concrete</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> Boundary objects embody and <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span><span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>knowledge that can be shared across domains and levels of expertise. For example, experts  produce prototypes or sketches of products as a way of conveying their thoughts about how a product might work and how it should be <span>designed</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>prototype</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>has <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>tacit knowledge embedded within it and can serve as a basis for communication, discussion, and elaboration. Through boundary objects, people can see for themselves the way that knowledge is <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and endowed with shared meanings. The Eureka system may be seen as a kind of boundary object that had different epistemic <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>for its various constituencies (managers, engineers, technicians, scientists) while at the same time conveying a set of common, consistent messages which changed the organization's <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>about the nature and value of field service work.</p>

<p>Information use in organizations is not innocent. Information is deployed in organizations to advance interests, to preserve the <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>quo, as well as to instigate open inquiry and new learning. If information seeking and use is the basis of constructing beliefs&mdash;beliefs that form the foundation of organizational <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and action&mdash;then we need to grasp more fully the epistemic dimensions of information behaviour as a precursor of organizational behaviour.</p>

<h2>Coda</h2>

<p>Our discussion here <span>raises</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>more questions than answers. Assuming that organizations act on their <span>beliefs</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> and that <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are based on evidential support, then research is needed so that we are better able to describe and <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>the methods by which organizations form and justify their <span>beliefs</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> This paper draws a tentative sketch of how organizations act as epistemic communities with <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>epistemic and information cultures that influence how information is <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and used, and how <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>and re-formed. To understand information behaviour in organizations is to understand how organizations are simultaneously information-seeking and belief-forming social <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span> where information is constructed through epistemic <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>as much as <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:96px 32px 96px 32px;position:relative;">.</span>are the outcomes of information seeking and use.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This paper is the first report of a research project on the effects of information service to <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in Japanese public libraries. The overall goals of the project are: 1. to develop a conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>for understanding effects of a library service from the point of view of sharing of information and resulting sharing of <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the service, and then, 2. to examine them in <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service.</p>

<p>The project consists of three stages: 1. a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the current <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the service, to develop a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>for studying its effects and to examine images of users and uses of the service by librarians in charge; 2. field work to <span>observe</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>interactions between librarians and users, to interview users about the sharing and use of information obtained from the service in their work context and to interview librarians about the sharing of information on users and user needs; 3. analysis of data from field work, to find consistencies and inconsistencies on the notions of the people concerned as to uses and <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(effects) of the service. This paper reports the results of the first stage, i.e., the development of a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>for studying the effects of the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service, based upon the literature review and the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the current <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the service and to examine the general notion of librarians about users and uses of the service.</p>

<p>It seems that there is a chasm between information behaviour research and the library use study. In spite of the suggestions by Zweizig and Dervin (<a href="#zweizig77">1977</a>), the library use study continues to be quantitative and has become simpler and easier to conduct. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span><span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>example is the Library Performance Indicators <span>Standard</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>by ISO (ISO 11620:1998). None could deny its success in evaluating <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and improving management. However, when the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of evaluation shifts from output of services to outcome, <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>seem to <span>arise</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> It is certain that calculating such records of use as circulation, use of <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>service and programme attendance is more clear-cut and therefore, easier than assessing effects of library use, because they relate to both <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and behavioural aspects of human actions and are difficult to define as the meaning of 'use' and 'effect' will change in the course of <span>action</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> Limitations of quantitative study are evident here and some <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>methodology is called for.</p>

<p>On the other hand, since Dervin and Nilan (<a href="#dervin86">1986</a>) proclaimed the 'paradigm shift', studies of information behaviour, at least at the theoretical level, have been focusing too much upon individuals in different settings, while neglecting how they use information services or sources. As Wilson (<a href="#wilson81">1981</a>) pointed out, only user-centred <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>can give bias-free data which show appropriateness and relative importance of the service or information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>concerned. However, <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and behavioural aspects of individuals in the studies of information behaviour have made it rather difficult to pay <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to, and to develop methodologies for looking at how users use particular information services or sources in <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>contexts except, recently, in the case of use of Internet-based services (see for example, <a href="#martzoukou05">Martzoukou, 2005</a>)</p>

<p>The present project is an attempt to bridge the gap between the library use and evaluation study and the information behaviour research by introducing concepts and methods of the latter to the former. To this end, the authors first develop the general <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the research and then conducted a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the field, i. e., information service to <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in Japanese public libraries.</p>

<p>The <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service is new to Japanese public libraries. Stimulated by the services of the public libraries in the USA, they started the service in the <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>1990s. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>group of librarians, journalists and academics <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>a society for the promotion of the service called Bijinesu Shien Toshokan Suishin Kyogikai in 2000. Its members have hoped that starting the service will be a step toward reforming Japanese public libraries which are at times criticised for their overemphasis on circulation and recreational <span>reading</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> They see in the service an opportunity for public libraries to <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>forward to the <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of supporting more diverse aspects of citizens' lives, a chance for the 'redefinition' of their services, so to <span>speak</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> On the other hand the government expects public libraries to help people start businesses and thus to participate in the government's plan to revitalize Japanese <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and industry.</p>

<p>The service is <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>for the project because there is an urgent need for <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in order to make guidelines for service provision based upon the appropriate assessment of needs and effects and there is much to <span>observe</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and ask, as librarians and users have to negotiate the scope of the service in the absence of a standard definition.</p>

<p>There are reports on <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service in public libraries (<a href="#welch05">Welch, 2005</a>) and studies of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information needs (<a href="#vaughan97">Vaughan 1997</a>), especially in the U.K. (<a href="#roberts86">Roberts &amp; Clifford 1986</a>;<a href="#webber99"> Webber 1999</a>). Webber pointed out that <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>people do not see information seeking problems as such but as 'business problems', so that they do not handle the problem <span>properly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>nor think of public libraries as places for <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>it. Conceptions of public libraries among <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>people and how they relate to the use are <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>issues to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in this project.</p>

<h2>Framework of the overall project</h2>

<h3>Theoretical background</h3>

<p>The most relevant previous study focusing upon a particular service is Taylor's value-added process model (<a href="#taylor86">Taylor 1986</a>). He proposes a model which explains the value-added activities in various types of information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>such as libraries.</p>

<p>Taylor's work is seminal as it defines the nature of information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>as value-added processes for anticipated uses and thus opens the way to evaluating <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>between users and <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>from the users' <span>perspective</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>value of a system is only realised in the dynamic negotiation process between a system and a user in a problem <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> However, his model still presupposes a kind of <span>isomorphism</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>between the <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>assigned by users and the enhancements of <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> This <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>cannot be <span>held</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> as there is no reason to think that users assign the same value to messages in the use <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>as in the negotiating space. In fact, O'Day and Jeffries (<a href="#oday93">1993</a>) found that <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>users of libraries acted themselves as intermediaries, sharing information they had received from library searches with others in their work settings. There they acted as information artisans, creating new artefacts by transforming and enhancing their <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>results before passing them on to others in collaborative settings.</p>

<p>At this point Normann and Ramirez's (<a href="#normann94">1994</a>) theory of value constellation will help elaborate on the conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>posed by Taylor. It provides an interactive and dynamic approach to <span>explaining</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>the logic of value creation in networked environments (see also <a href="#huotari01">Huotari &amp; Chatman, 2001</a>). In traditional theories value is created through a 'value <span>chain</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>. Normann and Ramirez pointed out that they fit well with traditional <span>industrial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>economy but not with <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>service economy. Instead, they argue that <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>companies in networked environments unite with each other flexibly as stakeholders and form a 'value constellation', where companies work together to create joint value which is manifest in 'offerings', i.e., products or services that contain value</p>

<h3>Framework of the project</h3>

<p>The authors take the <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>that every <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>is situated in a context (<a href="#suchman87">Suchman 1987</a>; <a href="#davenport02">Davenport 2002</a>) and that value is jointly created in concerted actions by participants in the context. From this <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> it seems that Normann and Ramirez' theory can be <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to include all the organizational <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>These concerted actions sometimes succeed and sometimes fail, the result of which will be consistencies and inconsistencies in valuations among different groups. <em>Effects</em> will be defined here as these consistencies in valuations. Then consistencies will come from communication and the resulting sharing of information about needs and uses of the service.</p>

<p>Thus, the basic <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the project is that the effect of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service is the consistency of <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>created in <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and the resulting information sharing among library staff, between the librarian and the user and among people in the user's <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> The hypothetical image of the <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and information sharing is as follows:</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p306fig1.jpg" width="472" height="200" alt="<span>Figure</span>" <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> /></div>
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Image of the <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and information sharing in the service</strong></div>

<p>Three different groups of <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>are shown in the <span>Figure</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> The first group (a) is that of <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>among librarians. Here <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the service are agreed upon as to staffing, available resource, manuals and so on, based upon knowledge (images) of users and uses of the service. Here value means enhancements or anticipated use, according to Taylor. They will become resources in the user-librarian <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(b).</p>

<p>The second group of <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(b) is between the user and the librarian in <span>charge</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> Negotiations are carried on over the user's need and the relevance of the information. Here value means negotiated use of information. It will be a resource in information sharing in the user <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(c).</p>

<p>In <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in the user <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>(c) the information the user receives will be modified and put into practice as part of their work. Values will be assigned retrospectively to uses of information they put to work. At the same time images of libraries and librarians as to their usefulness will be <span>formed</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Three different <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>will be identified in different groups: (a) enhancements of anticipated use (Taylor) or offerings (Normann and Ramirez) which librarians will expect users to get from service; (b) negotiations which will be <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>between users and the library; (c) uses that users and other members of the user <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>will find in information or services they have received at the library. Finding consistencies and inconsistencies among these three conceptions of value is the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>problem to be <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in this project.</p>

<h3>Research questions and methodology of the first stage</h3>

<p>With the above mentioned <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in mind, the following three research questions are set for the first stage:</p>

<ol>
<li>What kind of services is currently provided in <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service in Japanese public libraries? It is necessary to get the overall knowledge of the field concerned, i. e., <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the libraries offering the service, varieties of services provided, and so on.</li>

<li>What kind of users do librarians expect, and have in reality? Users and uses, both in expectation and in reality, are together determining factors in providing the service.</li>

<li>What kind of uses or <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>do librarians think users get from the service? Based upon the anticipated valuations by users, librarians organize their service, and, conversely, the organization of service will attract certain types of users.</li>
</ol>

<p>A series of field trips and a focus-group interview have been conducted.   There was no <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the libraries offering the service. Therefore, the project started by locating and listing them and thirty-one libraries were identified, from which a total of twenty-two libraries were selected for the field trips. The <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>criteria were the location and the level of service: included were those libraries known to be active in offering the service.</p>

<p>After the trip, a more comprehensive <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>was conducted by Bijinesu Shien Toshokan Suishin Kyogikai [the Society for the Promotion of the Business Information Service in Public Libraries] in 2006. Of 1,045 libraries responding, the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>identified 121 libraries currently offering <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service (<a href="#bijinesu06">Society for the Promotion... 2006</a>). The difference between this <span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and that which the present authors identified certainly shows the rapid <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the service in Japanese public libraries. However, it should be noted that as the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>by the Society did not define the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service but left the definition to responding libraries,  and their <span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>might include a number of libraries only holding <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>books and providing no special service to the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span><span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>At each visit a semi-structured interview was conducted. Following the research questions, the interview guide included such questions as: goals and objectives of the service, history, services provided, <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>development and other preparatory work, <span>approximate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>number of users and their profiles and relationships with other agencies and organizations. The last question was <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>because it was known that other groups or stakeholders would communicate with libraries and/or users and have strong influence over the service.</p>

<p>In order to collect data supporting the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the field trips, a group interview was conducted on 6 February. Six librarians participated.</p>

<h2>Findings and interim <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the results</h2>

<p>Following are some of the results focusing mainly on users and uses librarians have <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and perceived.</p>

<p>Based on the services provided, a typology of libraries was developed: a number of libraries provided only a couple of shelves or a corner with shelves for <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>material. This group of libraries can be called <em>libraries with minimal service</em>. Most libraries which claim they are offering the service <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>fall in this category. Another group of libraries <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span><span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>service as well as shelves or a corner. This group may be called the <em>reference service group</em>. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span><span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>group <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>a consultation service by appointment with specialists like <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>consultants, solicitors and retired managers. This group may be called the <em>consultation service group</em>. Libraries provided various programmes, which were <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>by all three groups of libraries and did not relate <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to this typology..</p>

<p>Levels of general <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>service and relationships with other agencies and organizations were the most important factors in determining the level and content of the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>certain level of <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>service and a number of <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>transactions seemed <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in successful provision of the service in the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>service group. Some libraries in this group responded that they started the service because they had already received a number of <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>questions, some of which related to <span>business</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> The commencement of a <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service in this group means reorganisation of the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>department in order to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>more effectively to the needs of the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and induce more demands from <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>people.</p>

<p>Also, relationships with other agencies and organizations were <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in providing a consultation service. The department of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and industry of the local government, the chamber of commerce and industry and the public employment security office were examples of such agencies and organizations. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>public library is normally regarded as one of the most popular places in the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> Many people visit it for various purposes: they read books and magazines in the library; sometimes they consult books looking for information, but very few people ask librarians for help at most of the libraries. Most people, including librarians themselves, normally think that libraries can provide books and magazines but that librarians do not have the ability to provide specialised information. Therefore, when a library plans to provide a specialised information service, such as a <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>consultation service, it is difficult to persuade local government senior officials, unless they provide the service in cooperation with other agencies and organizations that have specialised knowledge or skills. On the other hand, such agencies and organizations often need appropriate service points where people can <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and comfortably stop by and ask for consultation or help.</p>

<p>Characteristics of the local <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>were also a factor in determining the level and content of the service. For example, provision of information on part-time jobs was the most popular service in a library serving a low income population.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>library in a rural area may provide information on agriculture under the name of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service as they find few entrepreneurs in their <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and most needs relate to agriculture.</p>

<p>As a result, the shape of the service is diverse. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>library in an area with a lot of small engineering factories provided a <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of science, technology and industry books, while some libraries in rural area collected books in agriculture and/or fisheries. Some librarians regarded their <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service as a part of providing local information, while others said many people came a long way from all over Japan to get consultation by specialists. Some libraries <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>to attract other agencies and organizations, while others <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>only to provide a space for other organizations that <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>the consultation service. Because there are no <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>or guidelines on <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service and advocates generally think such a task of defining, and thus <span>limiting</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>the territory of the service, is unneccessary at this stage of rapid <span>growth</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> various types of services are provided under the name of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service.</p>

<p>The resulting images of users by librarians are also diverse. Some librarians in the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>service group said their users were mainly men with <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>suits, while others (also in the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>service group) felt their users were more usually women looking for part-time jobs. Some consultation services specialised in advising people planning to start a small <span>business</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> while others tended to support people with problems in everyday life, such as the procedure of importing goods, question about paying taxes, or even <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>something <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>doing for mothers who have just been freed from child care. Not surprisingly, libraries with a consultation service usually have deeper understanding of user needs, but even a library with only shelves and notice boards for <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information could talk much of <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of their users. In that case the librarian has had close contact with  local <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>groups and Bijinesu Shien Toshokan Suishin Kyogikai. Thus, it is <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>that images of users are <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>not only by <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>contact with users but also by complex relationship with various stakeholders.</p>

<p>Differences were found in the librarians' conceptions of the <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of the service. Librarians in the minimal and <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>service groups said that people would be attracted to the organized rich <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of libraries, while librarians and specialists in the consultation service group often mentioned the openness and comfort of use as the reason why local government agencies and other organisations wanted to support the <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service in libraries. They thought of libraries as a first contact point for those people who wanted to start a <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>or needed help in everyday life or were looking for a job. Librarians in the minimal and <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>service groups expressed <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>in identifying users' needs and uses, while specialists (not librarians)  in the consultation service group could describe the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>of users and uses clearly. It was impressive to find that librarians in the minimal and <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>service groups tended to think that their services met the specific needs of users while specialists in the consultation service group tended to think they met users' needs in Kuhlthau's prefocus stage (<a href="#kuhlthau04">Kuhlthau, 2004</a>) owing to libraries' popularity, openess and ease of use.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Results of the field trips <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span><span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>the complex process of value creation in preparation of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service. The initial <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>must be modified because of the importance of stakeholders such as relating agencies and organizations as well as specialists in the consultation service group. Relationships with them seem to be one of the most important factors in determining the nature of <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>information service. The authors will include them in the second stage of the Project.</p>

<p>Images of users and uses vary in accordance with <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>created in this process. Very roughly <span>speaking</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span> there are two types of users: users of the minimal and <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>service groups can be called library users, while many users in the consultation service group may not use libraries, as previous studies suggested.</p>

<p>Also images are <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>not only by <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>contact with users but as a result of this complex process. <span>Sometimes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>images have political connotations as both librarians and local government officials hope the service to be useful in promoting local <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:78px 26px 78px 26px;position:relative;">.</span>and/or industry and advancing local lives.</p>

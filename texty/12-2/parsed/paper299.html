<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Contemporary society is often called a knowledge society. Despite the use of countless related terms, it seems that this general label is well <span>accepted</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> due to the <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that knowledge has taken on increasing importance in socioeconomic processes. Drucker (<a href="#drucker94">1994</a>: 16) characterizes this society as a society of organizations. According to him, to survive, an individual <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>on his/her association with others, based on goals defined by organizations and on the knowledge that these organizations accumulate collectively to reach their objectives. In this way, individuals and organizations coexist increasingly in an interdependent relationship.</p> 

<p>An organization&mdash;a simple association of individuals, a conglomerate, or a holding&mdash;with specific missions and objectives collects and manipulates strategic information. It also builds knowledge, using this knowledge to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>networks of relationships and production networks. These networks are characteristic of contemporary society and their importance grows daily, strengthened through the use of information and communication technologies. </p> 

<p>Be0es increasing the potential of networks, information and communication technologies, since they allow simultaneous interactivity and information exchange and use, stimulate organizations to rethink traditional <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>formats and to create new ones. In this way, they stimulate the acceptance of the notion that associations of individuals and groups of all <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>should become information and knowledge organizations. In short, people are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of information and knowledge as basic building blocks for their organizations.</p> 

<p>One consequence of these changes has been an alteration in attitude toward information processes. Now, the <span>collection</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> organization, recording and <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of information, traditionally within the purview of librarianship and archival studies, are now skills demanded from any professional in an organization, particularly regarding digital information. Familiarity with new processes and technologies on the part of all participants in an organization is a <em>sine qua non</em> for generating the knowledge necessary for the survival and development of the organization.</p> 

<p>Information and knowledge become, therefore, an input in the provision of any product or service. When there is a change in the sources (inputs), there are, in consequence, changes in the society's organization and in work relationships. In this sense, information and knowledge are changing organizations and the world of work. As Arruda <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#arrudaetal00">2000</a>: 15) put it, these changes bring to the fore <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>between work and <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 

<p>Specifically in the field of information, these con0erations lead to a reflection on policies regarding the <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of information professionals. Since today people of different professional <span>backgrounds</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>work in the field of information, it is difficult to determine where educational policies should be applied. But we must start somewhere; perhaps a good place is the <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that teach librarianship and archival science, from which the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of new informational skills could later be expanded.</p>

<p>The present text suggests some of the areas in which current <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>practices in librarianship and closely related fields are increasingly inadequate for the formation of information professionals. The authors point to skills that, if these were more commonly taught in library, archival, or information studies courses, could help bridge the gap between the skills <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in classrooms and those required by labor markets. Attention to these skills may help librarians, archivists, records managers and others like them to <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>their <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to an ever-changing and knowledge-intensive world, along with the professional prestige and respect that these overwhelmingly female professionals, in Brazil and elsewhere, have long fought to gain.</p>

<p>It is very important to note that in Brazil, the profession of librarianship is learned in undergraduate courses, such as Journalism, Economy, Pharmacy, <span>Psychology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>or Medicine, among others. There is also a regulatory act from the National Congress that gives librarians the privilege of being the only people allowed to be responsible for libraries. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>professional corporatist institution called the Conselho Nacional de Biblioteconomia (National Council of Librarianship), linked to the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>government and managed exclusively for librarians, enforces the regulation to avoid the invasion of their labour <span>force</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>by other professionals. By Brazilian law <em>illegal exercising of a profession</em> is a crime punishable by a prison <span>sentence</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> </p> 

<p>Below, we first <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>concept of core competencies. Next, we present an <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>study, in which a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>was administered to recent graduates of the Institute of Information Science, of the Federal University of Bahia, Brazil, between March and October of 2004. The <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>had graduated between 2000 and 2003. The interviewees were asked to <span>attribute</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of importance to specific items relative to knowledge and skills that were con0ered to be components of the core competencies necessary to their work. Participants were also asked to cite the <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge they had <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>over the course of their undergraduate careers and those that they used in exercising their profession; the skills they con0ered necessary and which they had not <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in school; and the challenges they faced in exercising their profession for which they had not been sufficiently well prepared. The theoretical basis, methodology and results are likewise discussed.</p>

This new context restructures organizations, eliminating <span>intermediate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>levels and promising to promote workers' empowerment, workers' participation in decision making and <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>among the several organizational hierarchical levels. It reorganizes production with more flexible processes, prompts <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>innovation, increases the speed at which products become obsolete and brings special <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>management and services. The standardization of production techniques, meanwhile, forces companies to differentiate themselves in terms of customer service, <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>distribution</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>To achieve differentiation in the provision of services, organizations should develop relationships in which they understand their customers' needs and expectations. In this sense, maintaining <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and intense relationships with clients demands the presence of professionals who understand users' desires and needs (<a href="#zarifian98b">Zarifian 1998b</a>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, the meaning of work has undergone significant changes. The restricted workstation concept gave way to the idea of occupation, <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>as an activity that is not <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to a group of specific operational tasks or functions. Occupation should be conceptualized broadly, evoking <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>knowledge of an area, with the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of horizontal development of an individual's career.</p>

<p>Those changes, as well as the need to increase productivity, innovate constantly and <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>competitiveness, demand that organizations and their employees develop what we are calling here core competencies. Basically, core competencies are related to knowledge, communication skills and the development of relationships, which, according to Vargas Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga (<a href="#vargaszuniga00">2000</a>: 13), constitute the leitmotif of the current programmes of study.</p>

<p>The concept of core competencies, elabourated by Mertens (1974, cited by <a href="#vargaszuniga00">Vargas Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga 2000</a>), involves: knowledge, capacities and <span>abilities</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> which mean much more than simply on-the-job learning or training. Core competencies are <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>as: a proper attitude and capacity to exercise a wide number of functions or occupy various <span>positions</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> even simultaneously, which <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>flexibility. Additionally, a proper attitude to handle <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>change in the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>is <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and this also <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>learning. In this way, the workers' <span>qualities</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> such as <span>discipline</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> punctuality and creativity come to be con0ered their core competencies. <span>Knowledge</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> team work, communication skills, the ability to work with information and technology, systematic thought, the ability to generate creative <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to problems, self-esteem, self-confidence and tolerance for frustration are some of the elements of the concept of core competencies (<a href="#arrudaetal00">Arruda <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>; <a href="#vargaszuniga01">Vargas Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga 2001</a>).</p>

<p>The notion of core competencies is not restricted to the <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of employees. Organizations themselves have begun to apply these concepts as well, in attempts to develop dynamic and visionary leadership from top-level administrators, the courage to take risks, trust in employees' competencies, shared visions, clear missions and objectives, the execution of plans, and commitment from top-level managers to change and innovation.</p>

<p>With these <span>characteristics</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> organizations begin to implement a different <span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of administration that demands new competencies on the part of workers. Organizations that value the following can be con0ered <em>learning organizations</em>: versatility of their workers; horizontal relationships rather than vertical, hierarchical ones; the <span>reduction</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of barriers to <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>between lower and upper levels; workers' participation and responsibility for their own work (empowerment); and innovation as <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to repetition (Machado 1996, cited by <a href="#arrudaetal00">Arruda <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>; <a href="#vargaszuniga00">Vargas Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga 2000</a>).</p>

<p>For Prahalad (<a href="#prahalad99">1999</a>: 44), the greatest challenge faced by organizations is to develop a <span>solid</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>set of core competencies, con0ering people as part of a team, emphasizing speed and <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>re-evaluation of the organizations' <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>models. Organizations should develop into true portfolios of competencies, combining technologies, both hard and soft, collective learning, multi-level and multi-functional capabilities and the capacity to interact with the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>beyond their borders. Prahalad reinforces the arguments of Vargas Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga (<a href="#vargaszuniga01">2001</a>), affirming that these competencies should be developed in the face of a competitive <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>constituted by eight fundamental changes: 1) globalization, which helps to form a competitive market economy; 2) deregulation and privatization, which have implications at the macro and microeconomic levels; 3) market volatility; 4) <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>mergers and the convergence of technologies; 5) <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in identifying the sources of competition; 6) standardization of production activities; 7) less intermediation; 8) ecological <span>concerns</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> which also <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>specific <span>strategies</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Core competencies appear to be a broad <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of individual and organizational competencies and they involve, according to Santos (in a seminar <span>presentation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> 2000), knowledge, <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that result in measurable behaviors. Zarifian (<a href="#zarifian01">2001</a>) describes the notion of competencies as the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>accuracy</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> quick <span>response</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> language skills and technology literacy. The development of these <span>abilities</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and competencies is <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to be part of a competitive market. </p>

<p>Zarifian (<a href="#zarifian98a">1998a</a>) presents two elements that are associated with core competencies: responsibility and initiative. For him, competence means holding responsibility for the success of an individual or a team in a work context. If responsibility means to be accountable for the <span>consequences</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of a decision, then initiative involves the ability to act assertively when necessary. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>will be competent when she or he takes the initiative to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>a problem when challenged to do so and takes the responsibility for her or his decisions. Asking for help and cooperation on a particular task and having the ability to use personal social networks are important elements in defining an individual as competent. Teamwork is always also individual, since individuals comprise teams and mobilize them to act. </p>

<p>It is clear that improved <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and training are necessary to assist individuals in developing the competencies they will need on the job. The concept of core competencies involves knowledge, which should be <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>through formal <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and training; skills or <span>abilities</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> which are <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>through practice; and <span>attitudes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> which involve emotional and social aspects. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>1999 study of the Servi&ccedil;o Nacional do Com&eacute;rcio (SENAC) that <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to identify new occupations for the twenty-first century <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that workers should demonstrate at least creativity, versatility and initiative in order to find employment. SENAC is an organization associated with the Brazilian Commerce National Union and it devoted to improving Brazil's workforce for the <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of commercial and service activities (<a href="#senac99">Servi&ccedil;o Nacional do Com&eacute;rcio 1999</a>).</p> 


<h2>Information Professionals and core competencies</h2>

<p>The professional profile demanded during these new times of intense use of information and communication technologies is based on three elements: knowledge, skills or <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>attitudes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Such a profile is not restricted to the new information professions, nor is it restricted to the traditional ones, such as librarianship; rather, it is related to all kind of occupations. The demand for professionals with those new profiles is, nonetheless, stronger in the information industry than in some other industries. With the increased value given to information, pushed by information and communication technologies, professionals with degrees in areas other than traditional Librarianship and Documentation are acquiring the competencies to work with information processes, also adopting and appropriating the language of information professionals. Meanwhile, other professions that have long had information as <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to their work are increasingly recognizing the value of information and information work.</p>

<p>At the same time, the traditional academic training of librarians has changed little in Brazil, concentrating only on those environments that have long been <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of such professionals: libraries and archives, con0ered, as they have long been, an area restricted to information professionals. However, as Targino (<a href="#targino00">2000</a>) observes, the <span>expression</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><em>information professional</em> <span>reached</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>wide currency only in the 1990s, circulated by scholars such as Mason (<a href="#mason90">1990</a>) and Ponjuan (<a href="#ponjuan93">1993</a>, <a href="#ponjuan95">1995</a>). The use of the <span>expression</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>was later reinforced by the International Federation of Information and Documentation, which created a study group dedicated to the Modern Information Professional. <em>Modern information professional</em> characterizes the <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>given to information and the access to information well and it would be a good indicator of what can be con0ered as the fourth sector of the economy; the information industry (<a href="#targino00">Targino 2000</a>: 1).</p>

<p>The information industry includes a vast <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of activities that embrace the creation, production, <span>distribution</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> recovery and use of information. It also incorporates several functions for which new competencies are necessary, but that do not <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>on a specific or formal college <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> especially because <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>are still adjusting to the new demands. Tarapanoff (<a href="#tarapanoff99">1999</a>) and Targino (<a href="#targino00">2000</a>) illustrate some of the entities and services activities of the information industry: (1) content providers, which involves, among others, print and electronic editorial business; multimedia; media producers; conventional, digital and virtual information services; information agencies; and interactive electronic services; (2) data, information, communication and <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>services, encompassing telecommunication networks, subscription services of information and entertainment by cable and satellite, radio, television, newspapers, magazines and educational systems; and (3) data and information processing services, including <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>industries and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and telecommunications <span>equipment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Teixeira Filho (<a href="#teixeirafilho99">1999</a>) states that occupations based on information grow endlessly. Le Coadic (<a href="#lecoadic96">1996</a>) notes that this <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and diffusion of professions related to information does not allow for the development of a precise definition of <em>information professional.</em> This <span>raises</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the question of who is an information professional. Since the Internet was <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>decades ago and the World Wide Web more than ten years ago, this question remains with no definitive answer, particularly among librarians.</p>

<p>Witter (1999, cited by Targino (<a href="#targino00">2000</a>) conducted a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of professionals enrolled in a specialization course on strategic management, <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the following majors among those surveyed: librarianship, law, literature, data processing, <span>business</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> zoology, economics and civil engineering. The objective of the study was to learn what the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>an information professional to be. Thirty participants provided some ninety-one different answers. The participants demonstrated a clear <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of the three elements knowledge, skills and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and they defined information professionals as those who work with information, provide information services, remain up-to-date, care about users' needs and satisfaction, work with a variety of media, are researchers, constitute <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>between users and information, are information facilitators, are competent, manage information, are critical, are patient, are understanding, are dynamic, are kind and polite, act responsibly, are active, are sociable and so on (<a href="#targino00">Targino 2000</a>:  5). This <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>demonstrates how even a small number of people can generate many different understandings of what is purportedly the same concept.</p>

<p>Guimar&atilde;es (1997; 1998, cited by <a href="#targino00">Targino, 2000</a>) <span>believes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that it is <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>information professionals to have management skills, analytical skills and creativity, as well as to keep themselves up-to-date. She notes the importance of <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>education, <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>undergraduate <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and afterwards. Constant updating is con0ered a factor of competitiveness, meaning, according to Franco (<a href="#franco97">1997</a>; 9), that professional competence involves <em>'new forms of thinking, new forms of interacting and new forms of living'</em>. Thus, research and internships at the undergraduate level are beneficial to the <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of the professional.</p>

<p>In the case of librarians, who, traditionally, were con0ered the <span>principal</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>professionals in the field of information, it is necessary to face this new <span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> in which they do not have exclusive dominance, in a very positive and confident manner. Being positive means seeking out fast and efficient ways of acquiring necessary core competencies. This understanding appears to permeate the thought of some authors who work with the question of the <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of librarians, as well as that of other professions.</p>

<p>Librarians have no <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>but to be immersed in the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of globalization and new technologies. As Targino (<a href="#targino00">2000</a>: 9) puts it, in <span>parallel</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>with the traditional responsibilities of information depositories, libraries and archives have traditionally used models in which <em>just-in-case</em> and manual browsing <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>prevail. However, these institutions are developing new management <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> such as <em>just-in-time</em> and virtual browsing, focusing on accessibility and sharing of information with other information <span>units</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> With this change, librarians and archivists should be attentive to the shift from the simple <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of information to the provision of access to information. With virtual networks, this is no longer simply a Utopia, but an increasingly <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>reality. It is necessary, therefore, to act with creativity, dynamism and interdisciplinary vision, developing, a0e from clear proficiency in the use of information and communication technologies, <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to synthesize information and knowledge regarding information management and policies.</p>

<p>Policies regarding the <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and training of information professionals must take core competencies into con0eration in order to allow those professionals to act in a wide array of new information <span>spaces</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> It is equally important that, independent of the <em>invasion</em> of the information sector by professionals from the most diverse of origins, librarians have an important role to carry out in that field. Even in their traditional spaces&mdash;libraries and archives&mdash; a new kind of professional will be necessary. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> the fact that libraries and archives are con0ered to constitute an <span>extension</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of the educational system, the importance of those professionals becomes particularly clear. It is vital to recall that this society can be con0ered not only an information one, but also as an educational society (<a href="#unesco96">International Commission... 1996</a>).</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>The methodology used in this <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>consisted of four steps:</p>

<p>First, construction of the theoretical <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to define core competencies, which comprised of three things: knowledge, skills and <span>attitudes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Although the research <span>instrument</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>addressed <span>attitudes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> in this particular work, only knowledge and skills are con0ered. The following elements, suggested by the literature, were explored:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Knowledge of:
    <ol>
      <li>Theoretical themes that are relevant to and <span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in the field of information.</li>
      <li>Bibliometrics.</li>
      <li>Scientometrics.</li>
      <li>Trends in the field of information.</li>
      <li>Relationships between the field of information and other fields.</li>
      <li>Societal changes and trends.</li>
      <li>Development of information and communication technologies.</li>
      <li>The provision of new information products and services through the use of information and communication technologies.</li>
      <li>Information management.</li>
      <li>Knowledge management.</li>
      <li>Languages other than Portuguese.</li>
	  </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Skills:
    <ol>
      <li>To communicate with superiors, co-workers and users.</li>
      <li>To <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>good relations with superiors, co-workers, and users.</li>
      <li>To develop and participate in team work.</li>
      <li>To identify problems.</li>
      <li>To provide <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>for problems.</li>
      <li>Creativity.</li>
      <li>To make good use of intuition at work.</li>
      <li>To <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>for innovation and to be a change agent.</li>
      <li>Flexibility in the face of change and lifelong learning.</li>
      <li>General management.</li>
      <li>Leadership.</li>
	   </ol>
  </li>

  <li>Attitudes were not part of the study because of the extreme <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>associatied with measuring <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and because we con0ered one telephone call and one face-to-face interview for participant to be insufficient for us to be able to make any important conclusions about <span>attitudes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> To study <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in this particular case, an in-depth, ethnographic approach would have been more appropriate and such an approach was neither our intention nor <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>at the time.</li>

</ol>

<p>Secondly, the undergraduate programme in librarianship and archival studies supplied a <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>with the telephones numbers of the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>who had graduated between 2000 and 2003. There were a total of 199 <span>names</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> The graduates were assigned to groups according to their semester of graduation and researchers were sent to interview specific groups.</p>


<p>Thirdly, we first <span>attempted</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to contact each of the graduates by telephone and were able to locate and contact 126 of them. The others demonstrated unwillingness to be contacted by the interviewers or had moved to <span>unknown</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>locations. The research objectives were explained to each individual who was contacted. They were asked to take part in the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>by answering questions regarding their socioeconomic <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and about their membership in the workforce, which allowed us to know if they were employed as information professionals. From them, sixty were so employed (50 women and 10 men). As the research objective was to know their <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and application of professional knowledge and skills, only those who were working in the field were then asked to participate in a personal interview.</p>

<p>Finally, we performed face-to-face interviews. Be0es a number of questions that are not addressed in this paper, we asked:</p>

<ol>

  <li>What knowledge that you gained in your undergraduate career do you use in your activities?</li>
  <li>What kind of skills do you <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>necessary but are not gained through your undergraduate programme?</li>
  <li>What <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>have you encountered over the course of your professional career for which you have not felt prepared?</li>

</ol>

<p>For each question, the participants were asked to <span>attribute</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of importance to each item.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>As described in the Introduction, the objective of the research is to contribute to the wider discussion of the notion of core competencies, which encompasses three other concepts: knowledge, skills and <span>attitudes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> The analysis that follows takes into account the <span>parameters</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>discussed above.</p>

<p>Regarding knowledge <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>through academic <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and training and the use of this knowledge in the exercise of professions (Table 1, below), the items that were most mentioned, cataloguing, <span>classification</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> indexing, reveal a perfect fit of librarians to the core of their profession. At the same time, however, these items lead us to believe that the curriculum to which these individuals were exposed emphasizes traditional techniques and opens few doors for acquiring skills to match newer, more contemporary needs.</p>

<p>This is in complete contradiction to Targino (<a href="#targino00">2000</a>), for instance, who affirms that the formation of information professionals must have as a priority the stimulation of a wide and critical vision of the world, going against the grain of the traditional approach, which focuses on the specialized aspects of the profession. Additionally, Araripe (<a href="#araripe98">1998</a>) points to the necessity of redesigning information professions, con0ering information and communication technologies and the changing context of their field.</p>

<p>These results become clearer when we analyse the answers to the questions regarding skills con0ered necessary but not <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>through participants' undergraduate work (Table 2, below).

<p>Asked about the <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>they encounter in exercising their professions and for which they have not felt prepared (Table 3, below), participants mentioned most frequently: command of information and communication technologies, relationship between theory and practice and foreign language skills. Such answers can be analysed in at least two ways: first, they confirm the librarians' need to gain, through their undergraduate training, strong knowledge about information and communication technologies. Second, eight participants noted that they had encountered <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in relating theory to practice. This could mean that even regarding cataloguing, <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and indexing the ICI/UFBA graduates <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>sufficient <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and training. Since, for example, the vast majority of Web pages are in <span>English</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> even given Brazil's substantial presence on the Web, improving foreign language skills should likewise be prioritized.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it is important to note that ten participants said they felt completely prepared to exercise their chosen professions. This may mean a high level of satisfaction with their skills or, alternatively, low demands for skills on the part of their employers.</p>

<p>Despite their educational deficiencies, the interviewees clearly are aware of what <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge would be necessary for them exercise their professions well. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> there is <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>agreement between the knowledge they claim to <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and that which they <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><span>essential</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> For example, since the concept of knowledge management includes that of the management of people, even items that at first seem not to fit, such as <span>psychology</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> interpersonal relations and team work, mentioned among the <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>for which they lacked the necessary skills (Table 2), are entirely consistent with the interviewees' answers.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>The results of this research point to a clear <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of a mastery of information and communication technologies by the librarians interviewed and not only in their operational aspects. The transformation of the field by the several new digital ways of capturing, producing and organizing information indeed implies a fundamental change. There is, then, a need for information professionals to learn how to understand the new configuration of the world and the role information and communication technologies and information professionals have in this changing <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Even cataloguing, <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and indexing, which are traditional matters in the <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of librarians, have been changing. Actually, the whole productive <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of information has already changed with the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of automated templates, <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>linked to databases and to <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of bibliographic control.<!--  This innovation made the virtuous <span>circle</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><em>information-stock-knowledge</em> quicker than ever. <span>Controlled</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>vocabularies can be accessed and fed in real time and continually. This way, the <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>are <span>checked</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> once automatic <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>permit <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>access to information without need of physical arrangements by <span>classes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> --></p>
 <p>Globalization, fast technological developments and new organizational patterns have had a profound impact on the workplace in many countries. Nonetheless, the interviews demonstrate that, at the ICI/UFBA, <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>practices in librarianship have been inadequate for the development of information professionals. It is clearly evident that there exists a meaning gap between the skills <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>by library <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in classrooms and those required by labour markets. Graduates seem to have not so much as <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that the restricted workstation concept (a group of specific operational tasks or functions) has given way to the idea of occupation, <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>broadly, evoking <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>knowledge of an area, with the <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of horizontal development of an individual's career.</p>

<p>Thus, the ICI/UFBA should adopt at least some aspects of the concept of core competencies, as they are presented by the literature on this <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>(Mertens 1974, cited by <a href="#vargaszuniga01">Vargas Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga 2001</a>; <a href="#vargaszuniga01">Vargas Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga 2001</a>; <a href="#arrudaetal00">Arruda <em>et al.</em> 2000</a>; <a href="#guimaraes97">Guimar&atilde;es 1997</a>; <a href="#franco97">Franco 1997</a>; <a href="#targino00">Targino 2000</a>, among others). Librarianship course schedules should be prepared to provide <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>with <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and the capacity to exercise a wide number of functions or occupy various <span>positions</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> even simultaneously. Such preparation would result in, above all, communication skills and the ability to work with information and technology. Students should also hone their creativity, versatility and initiative, in order to find employment. Data collected in the interviews demonstrate that librarians who graduated from that Institute were not given these kind of competencies in their courses. In fact, when they discussed the <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>they encountered and for which they were unprepared, the most cited skill was a command of information and communication technologies; when they discussed the necessary skills they lacked, the most mentioned was, again, their relationship with new technologies.</p>

<p>This <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of core competencies is clearer still in the answers participants gave when asked about the <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>they encountered in exercising their professions and for which they felt unprepared. As we have seen, interviewees mentioned most frequently: command of information and communication technologies, relationship between theory and practice and foreign language skills. The interviewees were, then, aware of what <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge would be necessary for them to exercise their professions. The knowledge they claimed to <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>was consistent with that which they con0ered <span>essential</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Likewise, the skills they con0ered necessary and the problems they encountered at work were consistent with each other.</p>

<p>The data analysis of the interviews leads us to argue that the curriculum to which interviewees were exposed emphasizes traditional techniques and opens few doors for acquiring skills to match newer, more contemporary needs. This <span>conclusion</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>is consistent with what is said about Brazilian libraries and archives, where manual browsing <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>prevail. The traditional academic training of librarians, then, has changed little in ICI/UFBA. New graduates are thus put at risk, since librarians are no longer con0ered the <span>principal</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>professionals in the field of information. Thus, if they do not acquire the necessary core competencies of information professionals, they will be confined to a narrow work space. In fact, as the interviews demonstrated, they have been graduating without having <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>those competencies, skills and knowledge, including regarding the understanding and use of new information and communication technologies.</p>

<p>Had it been possible to interview graduates who were unemployed or working in occupations <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the information professions, we might have gained answers to a number of <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>questions: were graduates unemployed or otherwise employed because they had been unable find jobs in the field, because they had encountered other, more attractive paths, or for some other reason? What other paths did they take and how, if at all, did their <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>contribute to their ability to perform their professional duties or achieve their goals? What, if anything, did they gain from their participation, however temporary, in the field, either while still <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>or between graduating and becoming unemployed or changing careers? Was a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of preparation in a particular area within information studies to blame for their not working in the field? Did they regret leaving the field, and how might they be aided in reentering it, should they desire to do so? Future studies should examine both the ways in which changes to the curricula affect graduates who subsequently become information professionals and also relationships between other graduates who do not become information professions and their <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in the field.</p>

<p>Our hope is that research like this can help librarianship courses take core competencies into con0eration, in their <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and training programmes. This way they can <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the professional prestige and respect that librarian have long <span>achieved</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> As many authors have been <span>writing</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> librarians have meaningful importance to the educational system, in Brazil and elsewhere. They must be given the best <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and training, in terms of skills, knowledge and <span>attitudes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The core competencies model appears to be prevalent in organizations and, as a consequence, to affect individuals and countries. In terms of organizations, this <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in popularity is a consequence of <span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>pressure to <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>competitiveness in a global economy. In terms of individuals, remaining employable is the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><span>concern</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Regarding countries, a commitment to social development demands the formulation of information policies linked to <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> in order to stimulate the <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of these competencies.</p>

<p>The complex relationship among knowledge, skills and <span>attitudes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> summarized in this text under the notion of competencies, will <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>fundamentally on the use of those resources in specific <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> This relationship demands, therefore, a capacity for <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>learning and permanent adaptation. Flexibility, key to all of these con0erations, forms the basis for the new <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of production enabled by the presence and use of information and communication technologies.</p>

<p>Individuals are responsible for the development of their own competencies and must use them to guarantee their jobs; formal <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>is <span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and is stimulated by the organizations. This <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>can be verified by the fast <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of master's degrees in Brazil. According to Arruda (<a href="#arruda00">2000</a>: 31), great efforts are being expended to ensure theoretical <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> led by entrepreneurs and workers through their unions.</p>

<p>In fact, the understanding that in the knowledge era <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>should permeate all of society is practically unanimous and some authors, such as Drucker (<a href="#drucker93">1993</a>: 154), defend the point of view that <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>must work in partnership with employers and their organizations. However, all <span>agree</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>that <span>universal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>education of high <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>is the top priority. Without such an <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> a society would not be capable of becoming competitive. Providing <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>with the knowledge and <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>necessary to accomplish personal and professional success is a contribution to society and also an obligation of any educational system.</p>

<p>Thus, the relationship between work and <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>should be part of the conceptions and pedagogic plans of the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>institutions. Colleges are responsible for facilitating scientific, technological and organizational development; for illuminating paths; and for stimulating openness, flexibility and lifelong learning. In other words, they are responsible for stimulating the development of core competencies in individuals. </p>

<p>It is important to reaffirm here the distinction between training and <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> Training provides tangible skills&mdash; the ability to provide an item with subject headings, database management skills and the like&mdash;while <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>helps <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>grow able to acquire new skills on their own or repurpose the ones they have already <span>acquired</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> In the current context, graduates need specific skill sets in order to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>jobs (i.e., they need training), but they also need the ability to acquire new skills, a willingness to work under ever-changing conditions, a commitment to lifelong learning, and ways in which to grow personally to help them in their professional and personal lives (i.e., they need education).</p>

<p>Academic programmes cannot offer full sets of tangible, ephemeral skills to their <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> but they must offer enough of such skills for graduates to be able to secure jobs that they can exercise with confidence and competence. Nor can <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>prepare every student to encounter any imaginable problem in life, but they must help <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>grow and learn to continue to grow. The challenge for academic programmes is to provide training while preparing <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>to continue to learn well past their graduation dates and to make creative use of the skills&mdash;tangible or otherwise&mdash;that they acquire in <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>and elsewhere, including on the job. Information studies programmes, whether they offer <em>library science,</em> <em>archival science,</em> <em>information science,</em> <em>information architecture,</em> or any number of other degrees or certificates, at the undergraduate or graduate level, <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the world, must continue to work to find appropriate balances between training and <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The concept of core competencies can help us understand where these balances might best be struck. Simply put, <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>cannot and should not prepare <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>perfectly with all of the skills they will need on the job and in life, but we can do a better job of choosing the skills that we prioritize and in helping <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>become capable of, and confident in, acquiring skills not taught to them in <span>school</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span> And although most of the cited authors point to this need, undergraduate programmes still are not con0ering it in any effective way. As <span>emphasized</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>by Vargas Z&uacute;niga (<a href="#vargaszuniga00">2000</a>) and Arruda <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#arrudaetal00">2000</a>), the world of work is changing radically, due to the new possibilities brought about by the information and communication technologies.</p>

<p> Likewise, the concept of core competencies widens the possibilities of workers. The best contribution that undergraduate programmes for information professionals can offer to <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>is teachers who help them to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>the core competencies to exercise the professions they choose and a conscious understanding of the continuous widening of their professional occupations.</p>

<p>This research brings to the fore evidence of the need to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>new curricula for librarians. The flaws mentioned by the interviewees are substantial and they <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>a high <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of disconnection between training and current work demands. Worse than this, they denote a strong incoherence between the theoretical reflections <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>in specialized journals in the field of information studies regarding the profile <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>of professionals and the training and <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span><span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:108px 36px 108px 36px;position:relative;">.</span>received by these professionals.</p>

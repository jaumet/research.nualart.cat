<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Culture has been addressed as an <span>influential</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>factor of human information behaviour. For example, Chatman (<a href="#cha00">2000</a>) found that cultural and social norms do affect ways in which people choose to <span>respond</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> are passive, or ignore information. Hj&oslash;rland (<a href="#hjo00">2000</a>) addressed an information seeking behaviour theory should define the <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>characteristics in human information seeking, including a <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of its cultural and social determinants. It is generally agreed that information seeking and use are not processed objectively but rather interpreted through expectations about life experience. </p>

<p>Culture shapes the meaning of people's information behaviour and rules determine who is to be con0ered an information agent. The way we handle, exchange and use information is determined to a large extent by the culture of our <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> Through living and working, people discover, shape, or create information during the process of interacting with the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>or other people. The <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>specifies or shapes what the information is, what makes sense and what information is <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>out or neglected. As Solomon said:</p>

<blockquote>information is something that is embedded in the fabric of people's lives and work. Information is constructed through involvement in life's activities, problems, tasks and social and technological structures, as <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to being independent and context <span>free</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>  (<a href="#sol02">Solomon 2002</a>: 229)</blockquote>

<p>However, the role of culture or its influence on human information behaviour is not stated explicitly. How should the relationship between culture and information behaviour be con0ered? Culture is usually seen as a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>which triggers people's information need. This paper argues that we not only can view culture as a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>but also as a big, boundless and invisible feeling of <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> in which people's information behaviour is embedded. Culture as a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>not only stimulates people's information need, but also influences people's way of seeking and using information. Also, people filter information through the various components of culture.</p>

<p>The author argues that previous models of information behaviour do not <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the role of culture and its relationship with information behaviour. On the other hand, <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>studies have examined the interplay between culture and human information behaviour. In order to bring about a more in-depth understanding of the above questions, together with culture, Berger and Luckmann's (<a href="#ber66">1966</a>) viewpoint of the sociology of knowledge is the theoretical <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of this study. Within this <span>framework</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> this paper outlines a theoretical <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>for examining culture and its relationship to information behaviour, based on a case study of Taiwanese aborigines' information behaviour.</p> 

<h2>The construction of social reality</h2>

<p>Berger and Luckmann (<a href="#ber66">1966</a>) discussed the social construction process of reality and pointed out that a society is both a subjective and objective reality and can be <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>through reviewing the sustained procedure of the internalizing and externalizing that people go through after they are born. In this way, people form their subjective views and <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>an inter-subjective world, which becomes a foundation of knowledge in everyday life.</p>

<p>Since the society exists before the birth of each individual, the social norms and tradition normalize people's behaviour imperceptibly and form a society called a symbolic <span>universe</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> The symbolic <span>universe</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>gives people a <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and lets individuals judge whether or not their behaviour is legal. The symbolic <span>universe</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>is a <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to people's actions and provides the chance for people to share with others the collective memories. Each individual accepts and follows the standards of the symbolic universes and identities himself as belonging to one symbolic <span>universe</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> This is the externalization process (<a href="#ber66">Berger and Luckmann 1966</a>). </p>

<p>Concerning the internalization process of personal knowledge, the authors describe the process of each <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>s entering into <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and having contact with others. It is the process of socialization: people learn from the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and those whom they encounter, especially the significant others and <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>their personal stock of knowledge. People continue correcting and re-establishing the meanings during the process (<a href="#ber66">Berger and Luckmann 1966</a>).</p>

<p>Berger and Luckmannn (<a href="#ber66">1966</a>)pointed out that everyday life is <span>controlled</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>by <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>motivation. Therefore, <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>knowledge, for example, the knowledge of <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>problems, occupies an important position in the personal stock of knowledge. Another part of the personal stock of knowledge is determined by the <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>s social <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> Because people live in the society, they must play <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>according to the social norms. From the objective and habitual <span>traditions</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> people extract and absorb rules which become part of their personal knowledge, thus causing them to behave according to social norms.</p>

<p>Other factors such as personal interests, restrictions (such as being poor), affection (influenced by the system) and habit also influence the knowledge types that people recognize and accept. Once the individual has habitualized actions, his behaviour becomes a typification, which then <span>produces</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>institutionalization. After the personal stock of knowledge is built up, it will influence the individual's behaviour and cognition; this is the <span>so-called</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>'intentionality', which influences each individual's attempt to reach different goals. Maybe we can not control the individual's consciousness and <span>inference</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> but we can know well another <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>s intentionality and comprehend the meaning that things or objects <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to the individual (<a href="#ber66">Berger and Luckmann 1966</a>).</p>

<h2>Method</h2>

<p>In order to explore culture and its relationship to information behaviour, this study illustrates three research questions as follows:</p> 

<ol>
<li>What are the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of Taiwanese aborigines' daily life?</li>
<li>How do they construct the meanings of information and daily life activities?</li>
<li>What is the relationship between culture and Taiwanese aborigines' information behaviour?</li>
</ol>

<p>This study employed a <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>research <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to explore the above questions and applied an ethnographic research method to explore how Taiwanese aborigines experience, understand, or think about the phenomena that they encounter in the world (<a href="#mar97">Marton and Booth 1997</a>) and how they think about information during the process of interacting with the phenomena. </p>

<p>In 2003-2004 the author lived in Tsau (twenty-one days) and Yami (nine days) tribes, observing their daily practice and activities and talking with them to gather data. Also, I attended their daily life activities or festival ceremonies to seek an empathetic understanding of the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of their daily life experience and what these experiences meant to them, as well as to understand how their specific cultural <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>influence them. The observations were written down immediately after they were made. In total, twenty-four Tsau people and eighteen Yami people were interviewed. Interviews were tape-recorded and were transcribed for analysis. Because most Yami people only <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the Yami language, there was a Yami <span>interpreter</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>available to aid in translating the Yami language into Mandarin. The <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>were carried out with the help of <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>analyses (NVivo).</p>

<p>I used certain methods of <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span><span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>valid</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>results in ethnographic research. For example, consistently <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>notes, immersing myself in the tribes and <span>exposure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to multiple situations were used to increase  reliability. As regards validity, I used field notes and an interview guide to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>criterion validity. I also employed construct validity in my research. For example, the results indicated convergence with Berger and Luckmann's concepts, thereby supporting construct validity for this inquiry.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

<h3>The <span>backgrounds</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of Tsau and Yami people</h3>

<p>Even though Taiwanese aborigines are deeply <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>by Han culture, they can still remain culturally <span>distinct</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> Regarding their brilliant culture, the tribal head decides many of the public affairs, even thought there is an administrative system in each tribe. In addition, the shaman has a high position similar to that of the tribal head for the Tsau and Yami people. Hunting is the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>feature of Tsau culture, whereas the <span>technique</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of carving boats is the most <span>famous</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>characteristic of Yami culture. </p>

<p>The Tsau people live in a mountainous <span>region</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>(Taiwan Central Mountain) twenty kilometers away from the nearest <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>with poor transport facilities, while the Yami tribe is the only oceanic ethnic group in Taiwan. In order to collect rich data, I focused on two tribes with different lifestyles. They have a slow pace of life and like to chat with each other, so messages are transmitted quickly.</p>

<h3>The <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the Taiwanese aborigines' daily life</h3>
 
<h4>The Kuba&mdash;the meeting place</h4>

<p>The Kuba is a common meeting place of the Tsau people, in which only the males can enter. When the tribal head or the elder has important affairs to declare, he shouts from the Kuba and every family sends one man to hear the news. This symbolizes and strengthens people's solidarity and functions as a social <span>network</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h4>The ancestral soul&mdash;causing them illness</h4>

<p>Two tribes believe their ancestor's souls can lead to disease, so they ask the shaman to drive the souls away, in order to regain health. In other words, they do not make appointments with a doctor and are not cured by medicine. Although the younger generation has a more <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>idea of health, they still rely on the shaman to help them feel at ease.</p>

<h4>Faith in the Shaman's&mdash;helping them <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>problems</h4>

<p>They also believe that the shaman can help them resolve problems, relating to being unpropitious, catching an illness, being away from home, having a nightmare and buying a house etc. They rely on the shaman's advice to give them a <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>or to tell them what to do. Because of the invasion of one culture by another, we can see the effects of combining religious <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and traditional cultures everywhere. For example, some people go to a health centre to get medicine to cure a disease, they also go to a church to pray for recovery, or ask shamans to drive the soul away.</p>

<h4>Hunting&mdash;maintaining life</h4>

<p>Even though Taiwan public authorities in Taiwan prohibit people from hunting, hunting is part of the Tsau people's traditional way of life. They do not want to give up and hope to hand down their hunting knowledge from generation to generation. Children learn hunting skills through observing and simulating their fathers' actions. Children are taught how to hunt, how to <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the footprints or calls of specific <span>animals</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and how to protect the forest and respect other people's resources and transmit such an agreement through the marking of territory.</p>

<h4>Ceremony&mdash;praying for a good harvest</h4>

<p>Each Taiwanese aborigine tribe has its own ceremony. For example, the Tsaus people's most <span>famous</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>ceremonies are Mayasvi and Homeyaya and the Yami people's is <em>the memorial ceremony for the flying fish</em>. They <span>hold</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the ceremony to pray for a good harvest every year.</p>

<h3>Meanings of information and daily activities</h3>
 
<h4>Traditional&mdash;tradition is culture</h4>

<p>People's behaviour is directed toward tradition. As Gadamer (<a href="#gad89">1989</a>) said, tradition is the power of history over <span>finite</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>human consciousness. We should become completely aware of effective history which has affected consciousness and has also been an element in the act of understanding. This is what Berger and Luckmann said,</p> 

<blockquote>The social norms and tradition normalize people's behaviors imperceptibly and form a society called a symbolic <span>universe</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>which gives people a <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and lets individuals judge whether or not their behaviours are legal. The symbolic <span>universe</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>is a <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to people's actions, each individual accepts and follows the standards of the symbolic universes and identities himself as belonging to one symbolic <span>universe</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> This is tradition and it makes sense for each individual. (<a href="#ber66">Berger and Luckmann 1966</a>: 94)</blockquote>

<p>Just like the Hollywood film 'The Fiddler on the Roof', the poor peasant Tevye under pressure from Jewish rules, survived by playing the fiddle on the roof. But he still hoped to follow the Jewish traditional etiquette and customs and was happy to lead a simple and virtuous life. Jewish tradition made sense to him, so he could <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span><span>balance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>on the roof. Obviously, how culture influences people is far reaching.</p>

<p>In this study, aborigines believe and rely on the shaman to cure their illness and make them safe and do not need additional information. We might feel the tribe's life is not <span>modern</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> especially coming from an information society, but it is their real life world and full of meaning for the aborigines.</p>

<h4>From generation to generation</h4>

<p>Based on Berger and Luckmann's theory, through the externalization and internalization processes, these cultures, learn from significant others or other group members. The Tsau people's hunting culture is an example. The ancestor's daily life wisdom tells them how to exist and transmits the hunting knowledge, they get the through learning by doing, not through books or other printed publications. As an interviewee said,</p>

 
<blockquote>We live in the forest when we are <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and follow our parents up the hill, whether they are working or hunting. The adult teaches us how to set a trap to catch <span>animals</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and how to use different <span>tools</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> We can say that the wooded mountain is our classroom. (Respondent V)</blockquote>


<h4>Conversation in daily life</h4>

<p>Taiwanese aborigines can be regarded as a society based on oral communication and by this way, they get rich information. They have their own oral language but no written language, so oral communication is also an important way to preserve their culture. They use spoken language to deliver the information. Be0es, they like to talk with others, because the population of the tribe is small and almost all people know one another; chatting with others is con0ered polite. Here is one example:</p>

 <blockquote>The pace of life is slow and people have much time and are used to chatting with others, about everything, even subjects we may think are trifling such as <span>newly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>born pigs. (Respondent U)</blockquote>

 
<h4>The relationship between culture and Taiwanese aborigines' information behaviour</h4>

<p>People's behaviour, includes information behaviour, embedded in cultural and social practice. The relationship between culture and Taiwanese aborigines' information behaviour is multiple, not only association but also <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> Based on the review of literature and <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>study results, the model <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>1 could be used to think about and understand the <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of culture and human information behaviour.</p> 


<div align="center"><img src="p303fig1.jpg" width="550" height="350" alt="figure1" /></div>

<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 1. The model of culture and human information behaviour</strong></div>

<p>This <span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>illustrates this relationship between culture and human information behaviour. Through the internalization and externalization processes, the tradition shapes people's stock of knowledge and forms their prejudices, horizons, <span>values</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> habitus, common sense and specific knowledge. When people encounter a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and need information, they will react to it with their own knowledge firstly, to judge if they need to seek information or not. If their own knowledge (or prejudice) can bridge the gap, they do not need to seek other information, on the contrary, they seek other information to help them. Through using the information and internalization, they extend their stock of knowledge. Again, the stock of knowledge determines if people will seek information or not. This circular and interactive relationship between culture and information behaviour, is <span>denoted</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>as <em>information fullness and emptiness</em>.</p>

<p><em>Information fullness and emptiness</em> <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to someone who encounters a context or <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in which information is needed: when s/he first applies personal knowledge to react to the context, this is a <span>condition</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of information fullness. In other words, people do not need to seek other information to help them. If his/her personal knowledge cannot bridge the gap, the <span>condition</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>is one of information emptiness. In this case, his/her information need is <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and s/he seeks information from an information sources.</p> 

<p>The elements of the model are briefly described below:</p>

<p><strong>Tradition</strong>. People are born and grow up in the symbolic <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> How to behave to fit the social norm is taught and transmitted from generation to generation. It is tradition and tradition is culture. Tradition shapes parts of the individual's experiences and individual build their knowledge through their experience. In other words, tradition forms parts of the individual's stock of knowledge, which is the first resource for bridging the gap when a problem is encountered.</p>

<p><strong>Prejudice</strong>. Prejudice is a concept derived from Gadamer's (<a href="#gad89">1989</a>) philosophy. According to him, prejudice <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to a judgment that is rendered before all the elements that determine a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>have been fully examined. People's experience, common sense learned from the lifeworld and <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> construct their prejudice. In other words, through learning by doing, observing and listening, people form their prejudice unconsciously. Prejudice determines <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>horizons and ideas about the world and with respect to information behaviour, it influences people's thinking about what information is, if they need information or not and why they ignore information. </p>

<p><strong>Habitus</strong>. According to Bourdieu (<a href="#bou90">1990</a>), habitus is a system of durable, transposable dispositions, that is, as principles which generate and organize <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>representations</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>that can be objectively adapted to their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>mastery of the operations necessary in order to attain them. Habitus affects actions and was constructed and cultivated by tradition during the processes of maturation.</p>
 
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
 
<p>The aim of this article is to conceptualize culture and its relationship to information behaviour. The author <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>a model to show how to think about the relationship between culture and human information behaviour, identifies elements of the model and suggests how we can apply the concept of <em>information fullness and emptiness</em> to view the relationship between culture and human information behaviour.</p> 

<p>Theoretically, this research puts forward a new model of information behaviour and <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>on the role and the importance of culture when thinking about and studying human information behaviour. This model is helpful for understanding some unclear questions, for example, why people do not seek or ignore information. It also aids us in reflecting on some ingrained thinking, for example, information is important.</p>

<p>ethodologically, this study demonstrates a way in which an ethnographic research method can contribute to explore the influence that culture has on human life and the <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the human life world and information behaviour. In the <span>future</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> we still need much more critical suggestions and <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>studies to improve and perfect the model and the <em>information fullness and emptiness</em> concept explored in this study.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Researchers have <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>examined the information seeking behaviour of particular professional groups in an effort to <span>map</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>their locating and use of information and to enhance information provision to these groups.  Leckie <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#lec">1996</a>) produced a model of professional groups' information seeking by examining the common <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of the behaviour of these groups. However, when did these groups adopt their information seeking patterns? Do <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>preparing to enter one of these professions share the same information seeking behaviour as described in the model proposed by Leckie <em>et al.</em>?  If so, are information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>around the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>addressing or reinforcing such behaviour as selecting and reselecting particular sources for convenience of access rather than information value?</p>

<p>This paper reports the results of two <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>studies which explored these questions about the information seeking behaviour of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in Ireland, with one study focussing on engineering programmes and the other on law programmes. Although the studies explored information seeking patterns in different ways, the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of both studies revealed similar patterns in the information seeking behaviour between  <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>studying to become professionals and information seeking patterns of these groups identified in the model of Leckie <em>et al.</em>.  Students learned their information seeking <span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> including effective and less effective <span>approaches</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> from educators.  Mis-perceptions of the role and value of libraries and information professionals in their studies were common, and as a result, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>often adopted information seeking <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>that excluded libraries and library staff. The studies <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>that engineering and law <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in Ireland could benefit from greater information literacy training and awareness, enabling them to acquire the information skills they need to function effectively and efficiently in their <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>professional work lives.</p> 


<h2>Leckie <em>et al.</em>'s model of Information Seeking of Professionals</h2>

<p>Leckie <em>et al.</em> ( <a href="#lec">1996</a>), base their model (Figure 1) on the <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>that information seeking is related to the enactment of a particular role and its associated tasks. As part of the communication and information seeking process, professional groups, such as engineers and lawyers, adopt, enact, and expect various <span>roles</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>  Particular <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and their related tasks result in information needs, which are, in turn, affected by factors, such as sources available, <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>use of sources, individual <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of the user, and <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>surrounding the user (<a href="#dev">Devadson and Lingam 1997</a>).</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p209fig1.gif" width="333" height="371" alt="figure1" /></div>
<div align="center"><br /><strong>Figure 1: The Information Seeking of Professionals model. (Source, Leckie,<em>et al.</em> 1996)</strong></div>

<p>For example, professional engineers carry out many tasks, such as <span>design</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> development, documentation and implementation. These tasks, whether technical or non-technical, <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>specific information.  As noted by Leckie <em>et al.</em>, awareness of information sources, including accessibility, <span>quality</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> timeliness, trustworthiness, familiarity and previous success, has a <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>impact on <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>taken in information seeking.  For instance, engineers tend to rely heavily on informal sources of information, such as colleagues (<a href="#war">Ward 2001</a>; <a href="#pin">Pinelli 1991</a>; <a href="#bre">Breton 1981</a>; <a href="#har">Harriott and Young  1979</a>). Similarly, lawyers have <span>roles</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> such as service provider, administrator, and researcher, which result in <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>tasks or activities, from which particular information needs <span>arise</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>  Like engineers, lawyers tend to <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>upon personal knowledge, experience and <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>when they choose information sources. </p> 

<p>When an information need is not satisfied, the user may begin the information seeking process again or redefine the information need.  Leckie <em>et al.</em> <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>a feedback loop, which highlights the benefit of the outcome of the information seeking process to the original information need or task, as well as other <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>unexpectedly.  In this model, Leckie <em>et al.</em> imply that the feedback loop only loops back as far as the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information need.  However, it is conceivable that the looping could also go back to the task and work <span>roles</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> at which point the information need, as well as the task or role, may be redefined and further rounds of information seeking may be undertaken, employing different combinations of sources and awareness factors.</p>

<p>Although the model is not <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to be <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>applicable to higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span><span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> it is nevertheless a useful aid for the studies reported in this paper. Because the outcomes of information seeking rely on the sources of information available, as well as the awareness of those sources, it can be argued that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>should be made fully aware of all information resources available to them and how best to use such resources.  It is likely that during the course of their <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> information seeking habits are constructed which may be carried with them <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>their professional careers as legal and engineering practitioners.</p> 

<h2>Engineering and law <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> information environments</h2>

<p>Student and professional lawyers and engineers have in common similar information needs to perform specific tasks. In Irish higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>programmes, undergraduate engineering <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>complete projects, which incorporate research and development similar to the work done by engineering professionals. Designing, <span>testing</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> manufacturing and constructing a final product or device are tasks that may be required. Of these tasks, student engineers may be involved in one or more of these tasks for their final year project.  Since the tasks are similar to those of the workplace, it is <span>reasonable</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>similarities in the types of information required.</p>  

<p>Law <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> like legal practitioners, work in an information-rich <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>which is in <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>flux, with ongoing additions to statutes and other sources for legal research.  As a result, those involved in the study and practice of law need to stay current with published legal literature relating to their area of study, or area of practice. This can encompass court rulings and judgements, legislation and regulations, as well as <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>material including research. Essential information skills required of legal practitioners include the ability to locate <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>material, the ability to evaluate the relevance, applicability and value of that material to the task at hand, the ability to manage that material, and the ability to use the information for a specific purpose (<a href="#car">Carroll <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>). Consequently, these are likely to be information skills that are required of law graduates on completion of their formal <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span></p>  

<h2>Approaches used</h2>

<p>As noted above, this paper reports the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of two research projects which explored the information seeking of different professional groups, specifically investigating whether or not <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>preparing to enter either engineering or law professions share the same information behaviour as professionals in the model of Leckie <em>et al.</em>.  The two studies approached the research questions from different <span>angles</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and had similar <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>  The approach taken in each study is outlined below.</p>

<h3>Engineering students</h3>

<p>This study examined the information seeking patterns of fourteen final year, undergraduate, engineering <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>split evenly between two engineering institutes in Irish <span>universities</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> Both engineering departments offer programmes in electronic, <span>mechanical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and manufacturing engineering.  The final year undergraduate engineering group was chosen, because, as <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>about to complete a final year undergraduate project, these <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>would draw on all the information seeking skills they had learned <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>their engineering programme.</p>

<p>Using Flanagan's (<a href="#fla">1954</a>) <span>Critical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>Incident Technique, the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> final year project became the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of inquiry, and engineering <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>were interviewed about their information seeking relating to their final year project. Permission was granted by programme co-ordinators and instructors for the researcher to make a brief statement about the study to the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in each engineering programme and to invite <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to volunteer to participate. Students wishing to participate contacted the researcher and received a Letter of Information outlining the study. To explore changing patterns of information seeking and <span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> each student participated in two semi-structured interviews, one at the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of his or her project and a follow-up interview at the end of the project. Each participant was asked to describe what they did in seeking information for this project, the first <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>they consulted and any other sources they used.  Their final year project was an appropriate critical incident, since it was <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>identifiable as a specific task and had to be completed by all participants.</p>

<h3>Law students</h3>

<p>An exploration of information seeking behaviour among law <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>focused on the information experiences of Irish university law <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> Again, permission was granted by the programme co-ordinator and instructors for the researcher to make a brief statement to the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in each law programme about the study and to invite <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to volunteer to participate. Students wishing to participate contacted the researcher and received a Letter of Information outlining the study. Semi-structured interviews, in conjunction with a brief problem exercise, were employed to explore information seeking <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>used by the <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>  Twelve postgraduates were interviewed, split evenly between two Irish <span>universities</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>The brief problem exercise was composed of three information questions common to the field of law, to gain an understanding of the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> awareness of the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of legal resources available to them. The exercises were formulated in conjunction with two university law librarians, and on the basis of the researcher's own experience of working as a librarian in a law library.  Participants were presented with three queries that they might be asked to complete in a given law course and were asked to explain how they would locate such information using all of the information resources available to them.</p> 

<h2>Information sources and channels</h2>

<h3>Engineering students</h3>

<p>Accessibility was a key factor in the <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of an information channel by student engineers.  This behaviour is similar to <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in previous studies on the information seeking behaviour of professional engineers (<a href="#ger">Gertsberger &amp; Allen 1968</a>; <a href="#lec"> Leckie <em>et al.</em> 1996</a>; <a href="#fid">Fidel &amp; Green 2003</a>). The physical distance of a resource and opening hours were key factors in library use or <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of use. Speed and ease of use, including accessible language, were also important factors for engineering <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>when selecting an information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>Student engineers seem to have a preference for channels that <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>the least effort or seem to <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>the least effort, such as the Internet.  This again is similar to professional engineers who are known to use channels <em>within arms' reach</em> (e.g., <a href="#bre">Breton 1981</a>). Student engineers viewed the Internet as a speedy, current information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>which fed initial information needs quickly.  In fact, the majority of engineering <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>identified the Internet as the first <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>they <span>checked</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>for information for their project, noting that they did so to get an idea of what the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>was about quickly and to see what was out there. Students chose their initial sources to help them define their information need, rather than to provide <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>knowledge.</p>

<p>Interestingly, some of the same <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>who con0ered the Internet as the best information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>for their project also listed it as the worst <span>source</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> because they felt uncertain about the reliability of the information found, they felt overloaded with information on the Internet, and they found it hard to find specific information using this resource.  It is <span>worth</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>noting that none of the participants received formal training on how to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>the Internet either as part of the curriculum of their engineering course or through the library.  Some <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>stated that they read about the Internet themselves; others used <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>engines recommended by fellow <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>or found in library guides.</p>

<p>With <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to other resources, student engineers con0ered traditional print resources, such as books, technical handbooks and journals, as key library resources in their research and said they used these sources to validate the information they located on the Internet.  However, the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>had preconceived ideas about the value of the library and other resources. Very few seemed to link online resources to the library and <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to the Internet as a catch-all <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>for all electronic resources.  Students tended to use online databases with the full-text of journal articles for non-technical information, such as <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>modules; <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>who used electronic full-text standards, properties of materials, metals etc., valued these <span>tools</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>Law students</h3>

<p>Most <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>claimed to use the resources of the library heavily over the course of their academic programmes.  This <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>lends support to views expressed in the literature concerning the role of law libraries (e.g., <a href="#wox">Woxland 1989</a>). Although <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>tended to <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>reservations regarding the adequacy of their information skills at the outset of their postgraduate programmes, especially with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to their ability to use electronic resources, the majority of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>claimed that they had developed high levels of information skills by the end of their undergraduate programmes, often developing these skills on their own. However, the problem exercise used in this study revealed that the participants tended to have problems in identifying <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>information sources for case law, legislation and journal articles.  As well as being <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in their knowledge of basic print materials, for example, case digests and legislation, most law <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in the study had trouble choosing <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>electronic resources, especially for locating case law and journal articles. Students noted that they wasted time when seeking information because of these <span>difficulties</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> When sources, in both printed and electronic formats, were difficult to locate, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>reported skipping a particular <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in favour of other items on a <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span><span>list</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span></p>


<p>Law <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>noted that their information seeking during their undergraduate programmes, and to a lesser extent during their postgraduate programmes, centred on items such as <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>lists, <span>textbooks</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and course packs.  Students reported that their legal training was largely teacher-centred and content-oriented. Pedagogical <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to legal <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in Ireland seem not to encourage the development of information skills among law <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>  There is a trend among many <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in other countries, of <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>from an <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>on <em>what one learns</em> to an <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>on <em>how one learns</em>, through process-oriented pedagogies (e.g., <a href="#obe">Oberman 1991</a>; <a href="#mci">McInnis and Symes 1991
</a>; <a href="#bru97">Bruce 1997</a>, <a href="#bru02">2002</a>). Such <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>reflect the belief that the development of information skills can be best <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>through engaging <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in active problem-solving and research based on partnership between faculty and library, enabling them to develop the <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>tools needed to transfer what they learn to new problems and situations.</p> 

<p>Electronic resources, such as legal databases and the Internet, became more important for <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>as they progressed through their studies and into their postgraduate courses.  Students expressed enthusiasm for, but in many cases, a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of confidence in their ability to use electronic resources effectively.  The study revealed that the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>tended to display poor judgement in their <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of electronic resources when attempting to match information needs. Such <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>reflected <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>expressed in the literature regarding the assumptions that are often made by lecturers and librarians alike, as to <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> ability to use such resources (e.g., <a href="#hep">Hepworth 2000</a>; <a href="#har">Hartmann 2001</a>, <a href="#gen">Genoni and Partridge 2000</a>). </p>

<p>Similar to engineering <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> law <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>offered a mixed reaction to the Internet, at the same time valuing the access to resources for research and also observing problems with this resource. Participants almost universally <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to <em>Google</em> as their <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>engine of <span>choice</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> with one participant mentioning <em>Yahoo</em>.  Discussion about Internet searching revealed that law <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> use of  Internet resources tended to be more speculative than purposeful.</p>

<h3>People sources</h3>

<h4>Academic staff</h4>

<p>Engineering <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>favoured personal <span>direction</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> either from an available lecturer or an expert. Similarly, law <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span><span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to be <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span><span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>by their lecturers, who tend to shape student impressions of how information seeking and legal research should be approached.  It appears that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>tend to take their cues from lecturers with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to all aspects of their legal <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> and attempt, as much as possible, to do what they believe their lecturers want them to do.  This seems to shape their entire approach to information seeking and learning, which appears to be based on a short-term <span>focus</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> rather than on any lifelong learning basis or any con0eration of their potential <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>careers as practitioners.</p>

<p>Law <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> on the other hand, tended to feel that a certain distance exists between them and their lecturers, as <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to a spirit of co-operation and trust.  Despite the fact that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>felt that they had been encouraged, on some level, to look beyond <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>lists by their lecturers, they expressed a need for greater guidance. Lecturers tended to be viewed as a last resort for <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>encountering information seeking problems, and, in this <span>regard</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> lecturers often seemed to be unapproachable.</p>  

<h4>Librarians and libraries</h4>

<p>When seeking information for their projects, engineers turned to a variety of library resources, including technical handbooks, library guides and leaflets, library catalogue, library staff, journals, online databases, previous student projects. However, similar to other studies of information behaviour of engineering professionals (e.g., <a href="#and">Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>), the library was not the first place <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>looked for information.  Like professional engineers, engineering <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>tended to use the library midway through their information seeking process for their projects and to <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>librarians as leads to information sources. The relegation of librarians and technical library personnel to a low priority may be at least partially explained by Folster, who <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>that, 'libraries and librarians are perhaps best classified as intermediaries and not viewed as <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>or even important sources of information'. (<a href="#fol">Folster 1995</a>, cited by <a href="#and">Anderson <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>: 149)</p>  

<p>Similar to engineering <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> law <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>perceived the role of librarians as being <span>purely</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>functional, to ensure that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>can access particular print material as specified by lecturers.  Because the participants in this study seemed not to appreciate fully the connection between the library and electronic sources of information, librarians did not seem to be associated with this <span>sphere</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of information.  There did not seem to be any expectation on the part of the participants that librarians might provide legal research <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>on a continuing basis. </p> 

<h4>Other students</h4>

<p>Engineering <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>consulted one another as part of their information seeking process; however, this occurred more often with <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to general course work rather than for their individual projects. Although student engineers may have a smaller immediate <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of colleagues to consult, that is, their classmates, they also consult their lecturers and they are encouraged by the lecturers to consult engineers and specialists in the field.  The <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>on collegial contact encourages the development of the trait noted among professional engineers of using individuals as information channels.</p>

<p>Law <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>appear to work <span>independently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to develop their own information skills. All interviewees expressed the notion that through practice and initiative they had developed their own skills, without a lot of help from library or faculty. Unlike engineering <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> there was little evidence that law <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>consulted one another as part of their information seeking process.  <span>Law</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span><span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>also tended not to participate in group projects. </p>

<h2>Information skills training</h2>

<p>Engineering <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>from both colleges in the study were given an introductory library tour in their first year.  This orientation tour was presented by a library staff member and <span>consisted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of a physical tour of the library, an <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to the arrangement of material, and a brief demonstration of how to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>the library catalogue.</p>

<p>Law <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>similarly reported that they received an optional library tour at the <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of their first year, noting further that this tour <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>the extent of their information skills <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>during their <span>program</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> The tour was provided by a staff member of the library and <span>consisted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of basic bibliographic instruction, covering little instruction in the use of electronic resources. <span>Law</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span><span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>reported that the  introductory library tour did not seem particularly relevant to them when  for a variety of reasons, including the timing of the tour, the <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>providing the tour, the perceived <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of faculty involvement, the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>on electronic material, the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of application of the information to subject content, and the fact that attendance was optional.  Like the engineering <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> law <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>found the tour useful in providing a physical orientation of the library.</p>

<p>Despite expressing negative feelings regarding library tours, most law <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>believed that the tour was adequate for their needs as undergraduates.  The <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>generally felt that the library itself was not problematic and that they had developed the ability to use its resources effectively by the end of their <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>programmes.  The results of the problem exercise reveal, however, that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>seem unaware of many basic legal resources <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in the library, and, therefore, are unable to use library resources to full effect.  In general, it <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>that the participants tended not to see a strong connection between the library and the electronic resources that were available to them.  It further seemed that information literacy was not integrated into the law curriculum.  There was no option for law <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to pursue any <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>legal research course as has become popular in <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>programmes in such countries as the United States and Australia.</p>

<p>Law <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>recognised the importance of information skills <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>  However, they noted that the importance of the library tour only became apparent later in their <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> because they felt they already possessed necessary information skills and did not <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>assistance.  There was an expressed desire for more information skills <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> with a special <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>on legal databases and the Internet.</p>

<h2>Discussion and recommendations</h2>

<p>The two studies reveal many common problems faced by <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in law and engineering programmes in Ireland.  The <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of these studies <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>several important points for con0eration for helping these <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>with their information seeking.</p>

<h3>Educating students</h3>

<p>Students may have varying <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to use both electronic and printed sources.  It is important that assumptions are not made regarding the <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>  Librarians can take an active role in developing <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in this <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and need to be aware of <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> changing information needs as they progress through the <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>system. Information skills programmes should <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>this transition. For instance, postgraduates have particular information needs and <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>information skills <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to match such needs. By <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>an active role in <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> information skills training, they can encourage <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to become more aware of the link between resources and the library, as well as the role of the subject librarian.</p>

<p>It is also important to remember that information seeking is a unique process for every individual and that the information need, the individual, and the resources available influence this process.  Over-reliance on particular information sources or channels is not recommended, because this can <span>limit</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>access to information.  Since information needs of an individual vary greatly as s/he progresses through even a project (<a href="#ell">Ellis &amp; Haughan 1997</a>), this must be taken in to account when training <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> </p> 

<p>Also, because of the nature of legal and engineering work, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>need to be able to find information on current developments <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>their careers (e.g., <a href="#erd">Erdmann 1990</a>).  Therefore, in order to equip <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>for effective information gathering and seeking, they need to be given certain skills in order to, 'plan a <span>search</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> use a variety of materials, locate materials, and use citations' (<a href="#erd">Erdmann 1990</a>: 458) and to validate an information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>first step is to ask libraries to provide this training to students; however, a more important step is to incorporate information seeking and/or literacy skills as part of the curriculum.</p>

<h3>Training the people from whom <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>seek direction&mdash;academic staff</h3>

<p>Students tend to take <span>direction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>from individuals, in particular, a lecturer.  Lecturers may be unaware of all information sources available and they may rely on particular information channels, which may not be the most effective.  It is important to include  academic staff in the process and to make them aware of new information sources and their use and to ensure that these <em>information gatekeepers</em> are pointing <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of potentially helpful information sources.</p>  

<p>Since academic staff are key information providers for <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> it is important to ensure that they, too, know what services librarians provide, especially in relation to training their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in information skills.  For instance, library staff can demonstrate resources to class groups and can offer timely and appropriate sessions to coincide with coursework and <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>education over the duration of the academic programme. Pedagogical <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>that encourage active problem-solving and research, based on partnership between faculty and library, can enable <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>develop the <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>tools needed to transfer what they learn to new problems and situations.</p>

<h3>Librarians are used to find leads to information sources</h3>

<p>Thus, librarians should take a leading role in demonstrating information searching techniques generally and validating resources on the Internet.</p>

<p>Given the amount of information available on the Internet, access to the right information is important. Academic libraries and information providers have begun this by providing Internet gateways for specific areas; examples include: Edinburgh Engineering Virtual Library (<a href="http://www.eevl.ac.uk/" target="_blank">EEVL</a>); <a href="http://www.efunda.com/home.cfm">eFunda</a>, the 'engineering fundamentals' site;  <a href="http://www.hw.ac.uk/libWWW/irn/pinakes/pinakes.html" target="_blank">PINAKES</a> (a directory of subject gateways), etc.  As stated by Agha, 'Mastering the Internet and making it known for what it can and cannot do should be the responsibility of information professionals'. (<a href="#agh">Agha 1997</a>: 49 )</p>

<p>While library tours are beneficial, engineering and law <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in Irish <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>would benefit from increased information skills <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>  In addition, librarians are <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to the construction of collaborative information literacy programmes, helping to integrate information skills pertaining to particular subject areas into the curriculum in Irish <span>universities</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> Librarians must be included in this process.</p>

<h3>Moving forward with information provision in Irish academic libraries</h3>

<p>With the Internet and many other sources available online, we need to ensure that people who are information technology skilled do not confuse this with having information literacy skills.  There is more to information seeking than just knowing where to find information; that is, it also includes problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and evaluation of sources.  The ability to validate sources is <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>even more important today with the <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of information available on the Internet. As Pinelli notes, 'Information professionals continue to over-emphasise technology <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of concentrating on the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of the information itself and the ability of the information to meet the needs of the user'. (<a href="#pin">Pinelli 1991</a>: 22)</p>

<p>An <span>accurate</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> in-depth identification of the information needs and information seeking behaviour of  engineering and law <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in Ireland is <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in assessing the effectiveness of a library or information service in meeting its information and training requirements.  Agha recommends that library services should, 'know the user well and decide on how best they can be served' (<a href="#agh">Agha 1997</a>: 49).   Information must be available whenever and wherever it is needed.  With the <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of life-long learning, all types of undergraduate <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>(part-time <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> distance learners, and full time <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>who work part time) <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>easy access to information.  In meeting this need, libraries now provide both on and off-campus access to their resources and aim to provide good <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>information from a variety of sources and formats.  Information seeking is a complex process and, as a result, the role of librarians is correspondingly more complex and more demanding to facilitate the information seeking process.  However, by <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>into account such factors as the influence of academic staff on the information seeking behaviour of undergraduate <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> academic libraries in Ireland can improve the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of the learning experience of law and engineering <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and more effectively prepare them for professional work lives.</p>

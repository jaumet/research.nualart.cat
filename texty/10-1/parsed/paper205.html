<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Family history is an example of everyday life information seeking.  It is an information-intensive personal activity that takes place in a non-work <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>  According to the PEW Internet and American Life Project, the use of the Internet for hobbies has grown exponentially (<a href="#Madden">Madden, 2003</a>).  These data show that 24% of respondents went online to research family history or genealogy.  When related activities such as participation in local genealogical societies, family reunions, and research in libraries and archives are taken into account, the number of people engaged in genealogical activities is even greater (<a href="#Maritz">Maritz Research, 2000</a>). Genealogy is an interesting activity to study for several reasons.  First, it is one of the few examples of information seeking in everyday life that <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>intensive and <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>use of libraries and archives. Second, although genealogists and family historians do seek assistance from librarians and archivists, as a group they have also developed their own social <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and networks to support their information seeking, analysis, and management needs. Third, they have a sense of both collecting and managing information in the present as well as the need to pass on the information in the <span>future</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> While information needs may be expressed in factual terms, the <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>need is affective. </p>

<p>The terms genealogist and family historian are used very inconsistently and have been used interchangeably.  Some <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>genealogists to be individuals who conduct genealogical research professionally, on behalf of others and family historians as those who pursue genealogy for themselves on an amateur basis.  When doing the literature review for this paper, the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><em>family history</em> resulted in the retrieval of articles by professional historians on the family as a social institution.  This article uses these terms differently.  'Genealogy, the study of ancestry and descent, <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>more to the <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>search for ancestors, while family history, the narrative of the events in your ancestors' lives, denotes the telling of your family's story. Family history is genealogy come alive' (<a href="#About.com">About.com, 2004</a>). With this definition, either genealogists or family historians can be professional; the distinction between the two is in the expectations surrounding both the process and the products of the activity.</p>

<p>This paper reports on twenty-nine in-depth interviews with genealogists and family historians and selected observations of their personal information management <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>  The interviews focused on both information seeking and information management. In general, participants pursuing family history viewed this endeavour as an ongoing process, rather than as a project that could be finished with the completion of an ancestry chart.  As a consequence, they have <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>strong networks and a social system to support their information needs. This has many implications for the information seeking process. While initially the information need may have been expressed in terms of the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>for <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>information, such as a grandmother's birth date or place, the ultimate need was for orienting information. I conclude that family history is a form of seeking meaning related to the process of <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>coherence as part of the mastery of life.</p>

<h2>Literature Review</h2>

<p>Genealogists and family historians have been the subject of articles in a number of different fields including archives, sociology, and library and information science (LIS).  Not surprisingly, the perspectives on genealogy vary con0erably.  The archival and LIS literatures approach the genealogical problem from a managerial <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> rather than an exploration of information needs (e.g., <a href="#Ashton">Ashton, 1983</a>; <a href="#Turnbaugh">Turnbaugh, 1983</a>).  When needs are addressed these are presented in a very narrow manner, identifying sources for genealogists, rather than exploring the full dimension of the need (<a href="#Boyns">Boyns, 1999</a>; <a href="#Jacobsen">Jacobsen, 1981</a>). The sociological articles examine genealogy as a cultural <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>on motivations for, and the <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaning of, this activity to individuals or social groups (e.g., <a href="#Bear">Bear, 2001</a>; <a href="#Lambert02">Lambert, 2002</a>).</p>

<p>Given the popularity of genealogy and that genealogists and family historians make up one of the largest constituencies of researchers in archives, it is surprising that so little has been written about this group. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>literature <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of archival journals in the United States revealed approximately ten articles specifically on this <span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>  Similar searches in the United Kingdom have located even fewer articles (<a href="#ref2">Boyns, 1999</a>).  What writings there are in the archives and LIS fields also document the historically antagonistic relationship between genealogists and these institutions. In the United States, archivists traditionally viewed genealogists as very superficial researchers (<a href="#Peckham">Peckham, 1956</a>).  This attitude has changed, although some of this legacy remains and, with it, <span>mutual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>suspicion between archivists and genealogists.  As recently as 1990, Mills outlined steps that could be taken by individuals in both camps to heal this rift.   Even before Mills's article some progress had been made in bridging the divide between genealogists and librarians and archivists. Bidlack (<a href="#Bidlack">1983</a>) discussed a healthier relationship between genealogists and libraries and viewed genealogists as closely associated with libraries, assisting in <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>development and cataloguing projects as well as being library advocates.  Turnbaugh 
(<a href="#Turnbaugh">1983</a>) commented on a number of projects in which genealogists heavily <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and contributed to the Illinois State Archives.  More recently, Redman (<a href="#Redman">1993</a>) and McKay (<a href="#McKay">2003</a>) have identified co-operation between archivists and genealogists on a number of mutually beneficial projects.</p>

<p>Duff and Johnson (<a href="#Duff">2003</a>) completed the only research study specifically on information seeking by genealogists.  This research is also unique because it views the archives from the genealogist's <span>perspective</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> They studied information seeking patterns in archives and libraries, <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>with access <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> and consultations with archivists and librarians.  In the end, Duff and Johnson found that genealogists were as likely to work around existing <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>as to use them and that, in the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>process, genealogists relied more heavily on their own social networks than on information from professionals. </p>

<p>The <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>between institutions and individuals in the genealogical information seeking process have also been discussed in the sociological literature.  At its worst, the institution (library, archives, records office) is a threatening bureaucracy challenging identity, belonging, and even the right to seek information about oneself (<a href="#Bear">Bear, 2001</a>).  Bear identified the loss Anglo-Indians felt when their history was <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>too closely into a world of <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>with biased classifications based on the cultural and economic needs of their colonizers. In turn, these classifications often conflicted with the family narratives.</p>  

<blockquote>The workers who <span>wrote</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to the railway officials never forgot the poser of the archive to define their public identities and determine the veracity of their personal stories.  These workers <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to end the inconsistent ways in which their lives and relationships were enfolded into the classifications of colonial. (<a href="#Bear">Bear, 2001: 369</a>)</blockquote>  

<p>This creation of narrative was seen as an important aspect of the genealogical endeavor (<a href="#Lambert02">Lambert, 2002</a>).</p>

<p>Narrative <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that people create <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and meaning from disparate information.  Previously, Lambert (<a href="#Lambert96">1996</a>) argued that people conduct genealogical research the better to understand their <span>roots</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and to get to know their ancestors as people.  Connecting through time became a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>goal for the genealogist.  When this happened, Lambert asserted that there is a commingling of temporal orientations.  As a result, the genealogist's information seeking goal changed from the <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and dates to a more broad-based <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>for information.  This, in essence, is the transformation from genealogist to family historian.  Family historians wanted to place their forebears in historical time as a means of personalizing the past.</p>

<p>The evidence concerning how much genealogists and family historians want to connect with others in the present is mixed. Simko and Peters (<a href="#Simko">1983</a>) viewed genealogists as independent and found that almost half of the genealogists they surveyed did not <span>belong</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to any genealogical society.  Dulong (<a href="#Dulong">1986</a>) presented a very different picture of genealogical organizations and argued for their centrality in the research process. The patterns and strength of genealogical networks definitely <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>further study given these disparate <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Genealogists and family historians, though, do have <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and a <span>distinct</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>role within their <span>families</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> Lambert (<a href="#Lambert02">2002</a>) has characterized them as <em>memory workers</em> who are pivotal in the process of constructing their <span>families</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> collective memories.  Genealogists and family historians themselves viewed their position of family historian as both an important part of their identity and a necessary role in family life (<a href="#Simko">Simko &amp; Peters, 1983</a>). As such, they were both seekers and creators of meaning.  This paper attempts to explore three of the <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>topics in the literature in greater depth: information seeking, the role of social and familial <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and the meaning of memory work for genealogists and family historians.</p>


<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>The initial research questions were:</p> 
<ul><li>What are the information seeking patterns of genealogists? and </li>
<li>How do genealogists manage their research-related information and integrate this into other types of family information (e.g., <span>photographs</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> birth and death certificates, and artefacts)?</li>
</ul>

<p>As the research progressed, additional questions arose concerning what engaging in genealogical work meant to participants and how they utilized family and genealogical networks.  This research employed interview methodology with an <span>observational</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>component.  Subjects participated in an hour-long, semi-structured interview focusing on the activities they engaged in while doing family history.  When possible, interviews were conducted in the participant's home.  This was done in 50% of the interviews.  As a result, information management <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>could be viewed first hand.  In the other cases participants generally brought along artefacts to the interview, including genealogical charts, scrapbooks, and other types of research data or family heirlooms.</p>

<p>The interview protocol was inclusive (See the <a href="#Appendix">Appendix</a>): questions were asked about the motivation and any triggers for initiating genealogical work, how the respondents learned to seek information and do genealogical research, and how they interpreted, analyzed, and organized research and family heirloom data and artefacts.  The questions also defined information seeking activities broadly: that is, including searching the Internet, working in libraries and archives, visiting historic sites related to <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>family history, and networking with other genealogists.  Managing family history information was also explored in depth and included very <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>aspects of information management such as <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>applications</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> organization of information, and filing <span>practices</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>  However, it also encompassed other issues, such as how <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>were <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>or passed along in <span>families</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and the creation of family history Websites or books.</p>

<p>Participants were recruited using several different methods.  Verbal invitations were announced at genealogical societies in the southeast Michigan area.  Additionally, flyers were posted at a local genealogical resource centre and at a senior citizens centre.  The criteria for participation were that the individual had at some time been engaged in genealogical or family history research.   One goal was to recruit a variety of individuals ranging in age, expertise in genealogical research, and family background.  Another goal was to interview people who had different relationships to the multiple social networks of genealogists.</p>

<p>In the end, twenty-nine individuals were interviewed.  The average age of participants was sixty-two, within the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>thirty-one to eighty-five.  Eleven of the participants were men and eighteen women.  On average, interviewees had been engaged in genealogical research for eighteen years.  One genealogist had been working on family history projects for thirty-three years, one less than a year.  Individuals were all of European descent and white. About half had done genealogical research in both the United States and Europe.</p>

<p>All of the interviews were audio taped.  The tapes were transcribed and entered into a <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>data analysis application, Atlas.ti, for coding and analysis (<a href="#Barry">Barry, 1998</a>).  Categories for analysis were developed in several ways.  Initial categories <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of the interview guide.  These included <span>codes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>for when people began to pursue genealogy, how they learned to do genealogical research, <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>with others (family historians, family members, archivists, librarians), and organizational methods.  Other categories emerged from the interviews themselves.  These <span>codes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>were often at a higher conceptual level than the initial <span>codes</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>  For example, after the family historians noted when they began they often provided a narrative of their journey to genealogical research.  Thus, a code emerged for triggering events.  It was through these narratives that I began asking whether someone <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>them to genealogy and whether they has thought about identifying another family member to take on the family history mantle.  Thus, <em>passing information on</em> was coded. Codes also emerged concerning how participants viewed family history at different points in this pursuit.  It was from these that the conception of family history as a process encompassing different levels of information needs and the idea of seeking meaning emerged.</p>

<h2>Seeking information: genealogy as a project to family history as a process</h2>

<blockquote>I've got a lot of irons in the fire. Genealogy is the messiest one because I can't - I can't quite contain it.  It's like - has so many arms reaching out for - and you never get done.  Never get done.  (Genealogist 32, <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>1022-1025)</blockquote>

<p>Savolainen (<a href="#Savolainen">1995</a>) <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to the difference between seeking <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>information and seeking orienting information. The transformation from family historian to genealogist means <span>moving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>from the former to the latter dimension.  Genealogists <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>out discrete facts and dates in census records, vital records in county clerks' offices, and obituaries on microfilm in public libraries.  For family historians, the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>for this information is over-shadowed by <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>information needs concerning connecting and seeking identity. As one participant noted, '...there are lots of satisfactions, intellectual and emotional, in this'. (Genealogist #19, <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>470-471).</p>

<p>Many of the interviewees in this study had long been intrigued by family stories.  One participant recounted going to years of family Memorial Day gatherings and listening to stories from other family members (Genealogist #1).   Years later some triggering event, usually a birth or death, would signal the formal initiation of genealogical research. Initially, this <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>was for facts,  but in many cases the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>broadened out to a more encompassing inquiry for information about <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>ancestors' lives or even of the time <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in which they lived.  One family historian characterized this as a desire to '...know where they lived and what they did. How'd they meet their spouse, how come they never had <span>children</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> or how come they had so many <span>children</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> (Genealogist 18, <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>147-148).  Others expanded their historical interests even further to the geographic location, time <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of particular ancestors, and historical events.  When researching a relative who fought in the United States Civil War, one participant <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>a diary from another member of his ancestor's unit. 'And we found an account; somebody was in the same company.  They had written a diary and so the diary says a lot of men were ill, so he died of measles' (Genealogist 12, <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>427-429). The expanded information seeking served as a means of learning about the historical narrative more broadly and at the same time filling in the personal story of their ancestor's life.</p>

<p>This shift in information seeking also signaled a change in thinking about genealogy in terms of an activity that can be completed to con0ering it a continuous process.  This has many implications for the information seeking.  Most significantly, as some questions are answered, more develop as family historians probe deeper and deeper into the lives of their ancestors.  This leads them to seek out more diverse types of sources, as in the example of the diary above, and leads to the need to develop more complex <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>out what type of institution would <span>hold</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>this information.</p>

<p>Learning how to seek genealogical information is a significant step in this process.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>number of the archival authors (<a href="#Boyns">Boyns, 1999</a>; <a href="#Turnbaugh">Turnbaugh, 1983</a>) noted that their archives had developed workshops for genealogists.  This study found that genealogists primarily learned from each other, a fact previously reported by Bidlack (<a href="#Bidlack">1983</a>).  The notable exception to this was that a number of interviewees had enrolled in week-long seminars run by the Church of the Latter Day Saints at their facility in Salt Lake City, Utah. None of the family historians saw archives or libraries as a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>source of continuing <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>or development for their genealogical research skills. Genealogical societies, however, were a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>venue for <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> both one-on-one and through <span>lectures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and workshops.  Education, though, was only one form of connection provided by genealogical organizations.</p>


<h2>Seeking connections</h2>

<blockquote>You never know who you're sitting next to. It might be a cousin or whatever. (Genealogist 16, <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>204-205)</blockquote>

<p>In addition to seeking a connection to ancestors, genealogy is characterized by making <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>with other genealogists and family historians.  This is done through a number of <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that have been <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to facilitate <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and research, such as genealogical societies and Internet sites.  All participants made use of the Internet and participated in some form of genealogical organization either locally or abroad.</p>

<p>Genealogical use of the Internet included a variety of activities such as research in online resources or databases, seeking information in chat rooms or listservs, <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>contact information for libraries of archives, and planning research trips. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>number of participants had also set up a Website documenting their family research. The Web has also fostered individual <span>connections</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>  One noted, 'I had one lady virtually hug me over e-mail because I was like, 'Oh yes,' I know who this is. Here's who his parents are and I've got the pension records for his Grandfather' (Genealogist 1, <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>303-305).</p>

<p>Membership in genealogical groups was a given.  These ranged from formal, local genealogical societies to informal genealogical study groups or distant parish record societies.  Participation was not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>face-to-face; a number of genealogists <em>participated</em> from afar through e-mail, phone, or letters.  Membership in organizations near a interviewee's re0ence provided support for the research endeavour through <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>methods, commiseration, celebration, and camaraderie.  Membership in far-flung genealogical societies was <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to identify local researchers (particularly in foreign countries) who would provide research services for a fee.  This participation also assured genealogists and family historians that they would receive <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>news about discoveries, sources, and perhaps even in locating distant <span>relatives</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Whether this participation was face-to-face or geographically dispersed, identification with the group was strong.  The strength of these <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>is best demonstrated through two core ethical precepts of genealogists and family historians: information sharing and giving back.  Information sharing both within <span>families</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and with strangers was common among the genealogists and family historians studied.  Many saw the provision of information without any guarantee of return as a way of promoting genealogical endeavours.  This sharing also <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to formal meetings where information was widely shared and others' discoveries were celebrated.  At the gatherings I attended, one of the <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>items on the agenda was for people to stand up and announce their <em>breakthroughs</em> or important developments in their research.  These were then celebrated by the group.</p>

<p>Almost all of the participants engaged in some <em>giving back</em> activity, such as lecturing on genealogical topics, transcribing records and mounting this information on the Internet, creating inventories of cemetery grave markers, or volunteering at local genealogical resource centres. Extended or geographically dispersed membership did not deter interviewees from <em>giving back</em>. One interviewee, who relied on the work of others at a distant genealogical society, noted his desire to give back and discussed his transcription of information from a microfilm into a database that could be posted on the Web (Genealogist 19).</p>

<h2>Seeking meaning: managing records and managing the legacy</h2>

<blockquote>I've decided I'm not going to get a book written so I decided what I'm going to do is I'm just going to start <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>up different things that I have discovered, giving the genealogy, the people, the <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and that kind of thing, and then some of the stories that I found out. I'm just going to type them up, you know, and put them in plastic in a notebook and then if anybody wants it? (Genealogist 9, <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>683-688)</blockquote>

<p>Information management is a core activity of genealogical work.  Family historians and genealogists manage information from a variety of sources.  Specialized genealogical <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span><span>applications</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> notebooks and loose-leaf binders, and narratives were some of the organizational <span>devices</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>used to both manage research data and create meaning.  The use of different organizational methods signaled different conceptions of genealogical and family history work. Three of these conceptualizations are the story, the archives, and the pedigree chart.</p>

<p>Some genealogists and family historians see themselves as narrators of the family history.  This comes out in several ways.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>few transcribed family stories. Others saw the narrative form as a means of synthesizing or integrating the very personal and <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>birth, marriage, and death data within a broader <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of the locality, <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>events, and time <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in which their ancestors lived (Genealogist 18).  Narratives also ran in <span>families</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> One participant reported:</p>

<blockquote>'My grandmother had written a biography of her life, and when she was 80, she <span>wrote</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>this. And, so then, we gave my dad a blank book and told him to write his....[She went on to say] My son gave me a <span>computer</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> the one who is interested now, he gave me a book - a book and he said here, you write your story, so, I'm in the process'. (Genealogist 20, <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>32-36 and <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>327-328)</blockquote>

<p>Narration, though, brought with it some literary license.  The narrators in this study fell along a continuum.  At one end were individuals trying to place facts in narrative form.  At the other end, facts were not as important as the overall story:</p>  

<blockquote>'I am also an artist. I put my albums together anyway I wanted - no chronology, just <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of these collage techniques, and my husband at the time would say, &quot;Oh, but you have to write <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and you have to write dates.&quot; And I said, &quot;No, this is my album&quot;' (Genealogist 21, <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>289-292).</blockquote>

<p>Others conceptualized themselves more as family archivists. One explicitly proclaimed, 'I'm kind of the archivist' (Genealogist 10, <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>127).  She discussed filling notebook after notebook, organized by branches of her family, with her research notes, photocopies of birth, death, census records, and original family heirlooms such as birth, death, and wedding announcements.  Another noted that this role was widely recognized among family members,</p>

<blockquote>'I'm kind of the genealogist, archivist, for the family and so they - if they find anything - and I tell them - if there's ever a time that you don't have space to store it, I will be happy to store it for you - so I have all their family documentation' (Genealogist 3, <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>150-161).</blockquote> 

<p>Genealogists and family historians who <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves archivists also think about posterity.  One discussed her own personal manuscript materials,</p> 

<blockquote>'Well, I've kept - all my life I've kept every <span>letter</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that I've received and letters that I write, you know, I keep them on my hard <span>disk</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> I don't think they would be very interesting to anyone but, I mean I keep those.' (Genealogist 24, <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>704-706).</blockquote>

<p>This quotation demonstrates a view of self as historical being and a desire to connect with the <span>future</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>  It also shows a very broad conception of possible information sources.</p>

<p>The navigator creates a <span>map</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of familial <span>connections</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> This is characterized by the pedigree chart, perhaps the most traditional genealogical product.  These come in a number of forms and styles.  The pedigree chart represents an organizational scheme that provides genealogists with a visualization of what work has been done and what work remains to be completed.  Yet, the chart is also the embodiment of <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>over time. One interviewee stated in awe,</p>

<blockquote>'I like the charts because I can bring it out and I can show you and&mdash;what's so odd is that all of these people make me who I am and I often wonder, Do I look like any one of those male <span>relatives</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>on either both 0es of the family? I'd love to know. But it's mind boggling&mdash;when you see that on a piece of paper, there are all these <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>running across. It's something else.... When you look at these sheets, it just stymies [me] that all of these people are my <span>relatives</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>that make me what I am today or whatever. I mean I - and all of us have this.' (Genealogist #23, <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>445-453 and <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>773-775)</blockquote>

<p>Narrator, archivist, and navigator are types of family historian, a role that participants assumed very consciously. One interviewee characterized her role and the scope of her work succinctly:</p> 

<blockquote>'My husband <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>to be what I call a genealogist. He finds the name, and he's got the birth date, and the death date, and the marriage date and that's when he's finished with that <span>person</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> I tend to be a family historian.' (Genealogist 18, <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>144-147).  </blockquote>

<p>She <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>by listing an array of questions about her ancestors' lives that could not be answered through vital records, such as how spouses met.  These queries were <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>of the interviewees and illustrate the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>for and management of meaning.</p>

<p>A part of seeking meaning was to make sure that meaning, once found, was not <span>lost</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>  Participants took pride in their role as family historian and saw this as an important position to continue.  Just as interviewees recounted being identified as the next family historian by some other family member, a number noted their identification of someone else to carry the family legacy and to whom they would give the materials they collected at some point. This intergenerational legacy signified not just the transfer of family <span>photographs</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>and records, but an initiation and an invitation into the genealogical process.</p>

<blockquote>My mother picked it up and when she died in 1983, I <em>inherited</em> all of her information.  And then for the past ten or fifteen years I've been really, really researching with my oldest daughter.  And we go to various libraries; we've been to Salt Lake City to the Mormon Library ten or eleven times. (Genealogist 27, <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>15-19) </blockquote>


<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>This article extends the research on information seeking and genealogists in several ways.  First, the exploration of differences in information seeking by genealogists and family historians <span>differs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>from much of the previous literature on genealogists in archives and LIS by revealing levels of information needs.  While libraries and archives have focused on satisfying the information needs of genealogists, few have con0ered the broader information needs of family historians.  Consequently, genealogists and family historians have turned to genealogical groups to support these <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>needs through <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> celebration, and support. </p>

<p>Second, this study is the first to examine how genealogists make sense of and manage the information they collect.  In terms of the personal information management research, this is also one of few studies to examine non-work settings.  Identifying, selecting, documenting, and organizing information are integral components of genealogical work.  Creating these frameworks was closely tied to how genealogists and family historians conceptualized their role.  Narrators, archivists, and navigators were the organizational schemas that emerged from this research.</p>

<p>Finally, genealogy and family history are as much about seeking information as they are about seeking meaning.  Self-identification and self-discovery through the role of family historian were an important dimension of the genealogical research process.  Family history is more than seeking <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>historical information on births, deaths, and marriages.  While this information is <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>in completing the pedigree chart and creating data points along the <span>lines</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> the family historian needs to fill in the story between the <span>lines</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span> And, it is this process of connecting&mdash;connecting the past with the present and connecting within the present to family and the genealogical community&mdash;that has an orienting function for genealogists.  It is also this aspect of the process that begins to address their <span>underlying</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>information needs. At its most <span>abstract</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>level, family history is a form of seeking meaning about <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>ancestor's lives, <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>own life, and the potential <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>among people&mdash;all <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>elements in <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:84px 28px 84px 28px;position:relative;">.</span>meaning and coherence. As such, genealogy is a means of working towards a <em>mastery of life</em>.</p>

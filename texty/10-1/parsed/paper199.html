<h2>Introduction</h2>

<blockquote>Yet a number of <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>magnify the isolation of the Mexican-Americans.  They are proud of their culture, and especially tenacious of their language.  They very much strive for self-sufficiency.  They distrust or dislike Anglo institutions, such as <span>schools</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> medical clinics, public housing, etc. (<a href="#childers">Childers, 1975</a>: 79)</blockquote>

<p>Every year people from Mexico cross into the United States searching for work and a better life.  Indeed, Mexico is the leading <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>country for legal immigrants to the United States and as of January 2000 over 4.8 million unauthorized or illegal immigrants were estimated as re0ing in the country (U.S. Department of Homeland Security, <a href="#USDHS02">2002</a>, <a href="#USDHS03">2003</a>).   Many find work as migrant farm workers, meaning they (and their families) travel around the country synchronously with the harvest season, conducting often back-breaking and dangerous work while living in substandard conditions.  Traditionally, this migrating, farm working population is con0ered among America's information poor.  They suffer deprivations due to their social, economic, cultural, educational, physical and ethnic conditions that prompt substantial information needs in thirteen areas: consumer affairs, <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and literacy, employment, family planning, health, home and family, housing, the law, political process, recreation, transportation, and recreation welfare or social service programs (<a href="#Childers">Childers, 1975</a>).</p>

<p>Despite projections of immigrants' substantial needs for information and support adapting to life in a new country and as part of everyday living, and notwithstanding the substantial research conducted in such fields as social work, sociology, <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and the health sciences, little <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>research exists from an information behaviour <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to back this up (<a href="#Fisher">Fisher, <em>et al.</em>, 2004</a>).  Of the handful of available studies, <a href="Flythehtml.html">Flythe</a> (2001) <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Latino immigrants in North Carolina as part of her Master's thesis, while Metoyer-Duran (<a href="Met91html.html">1991</a>, <a href="Met93html.html">1993</a>) focused upon the <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and types of ethno-linguistic information gatekeepers in Native American, Asian and Latino populations in California, Chu (<a href="#Chu">1999</a>) addressed the role of immigrant child mediators in California, and Sligo and Janeson (<a href="#Sligo">2000</a>) examined the use of health information by Pacific immigrants in New Zealand.  To this are <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the few papers written from a professional library and information science  <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that are primarily descriptive and <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>upon library challenges and responses to the immigrant <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>(e.g., <a href="#Berger">Berger, 1999</a>; <a href="#Center">Center for Policy <span>Development</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Staff, 1990</a>; <a href="#Ganss">Ganss, 1999</a>; <a href="#Gonzalez">Gonzalez, 1999</a>; <a href="#Jones">Jones, 1999</a>; <a href="#Lazinger">Lazinger &amp; Peritz, 1993</a>; <a href="#Luevano-Molina">Luevano-Molina, 2001</a>; <a href="#Payne">Payne, 1998</a>; <a href="#PenaMcCook">de la Pena McCook &amp; Lippincott, 1998</a>; <a href="#Su">Su &amp; Conaway, 1995</a>; <a href="#Tangen">Tangen, 1996</a>; <a href="#To">To, 1995</a>; <a href="#Yum">Yum, 1982</a>).  Beyond indicating <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>everyday needs and a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of awareness of existing resources, as Fisher <em>et al.</em>, conclude, ...collectively, these studies <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that different social types play significant <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in the flow of information and that the pursuit and receipt of instrumental help within immigrant populations may differ according to cultural background'.  But what are these <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>information needs and what are the effects of different actors and settings? In the current study, we explored these questions as part of our <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>on the everyday information behaviour of migrant Hispanic farm workers and their <span>families</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in Central Washington State.  Our <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>are shared, following an overview of the study's contextual background and methodology.</p>

<h2>Yakima Valley: the people and the land in context</h2>

<p>Yakima Valley (population 222,000) is located on the eastern 0e of the Cascade Mountains in Washington State.  Dependent upon its thriving agricultural industry, it is the top producer in fruit trees, apples, winter pears, and hops in the USA and is fourth in the value of all fruits in the USA as well as a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>provider of spearmint, corn, onions, and asparagus. With the largest inventory of cattle and sheep in the state, Yakima Valley is also the foremost producer of milk per cow in the nation.  Washington has recently garnered national <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>for its wineries.  Within a sixty mile <span>radius</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of Yakima Valley, the area boasts five college or vocational <span>schools</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> five hospitals and several clinics, more than twenty libraries, over 250 churches that include Buddhist and Jewish temples, sixty-three museums, cultural and historic sites, and a state park.  However, despite its richness in agriculture, Yakima Valley is designated as an economically distressed area with low wages, and high unemployment and poverty levels. </p>

<p>The area's agricultural <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>attracts a large population (80,000) of migrant farm workers from Mexico.  These workers may be categorized according to their background and <span>length</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of time in the area along three <span>lines</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  The <em>Settled-out Mexican American Farm Worker</em> group are descendents of past migrants from Texas or California and/or second and <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>generation Mexican labourers. They generally have some <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and some Spanish.  The second group, <em>Settled-out Mexican Farm Workers</em>, arrived and settled-out in the <span>region</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>within the past twenty years. As first generation Mexicans, they typically have little to no <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>skills and <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>education.  The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>group, <em>Recent Mexican Farm Worker Arrivals</em>, arrived to the area more recently from particularly impoverished <span>regions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of Mexico.  They typically have the jobs that are the most physically challenging with the lowest pay, little to no <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>or <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>skills, and are either illegal immigrants or have only temporary work permits. Some live in Washington seasonally, some settle in the area, and most still migrate to where they can find further work.  The <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of these immigrants are often found in area elementary and middle <span>schools</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> but they typically have low educational achievement, high dropout rates, and few pursue <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>degrees.  Low educational levels prohibit many of these young people from pursuing non-farm related work as they are not equipped with requisite job skills.</p>

<p>In addition to the Hispanic farm workers, there are two other significant populations in the Yakima Valley.  The first are the members of the Native American Yakama Tribe.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>sovereign state with its own government and sense of <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> the Yakama Tribal members tend to 'take care of their own' and have built up their own support <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> The other is the Caucasian population that also shares the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>resources.  There is little co-operation or sense of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>among these three groups.  Neither Hispanics nor Native Americans are <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>on any of the boards or the Chamber of Commerce, nor do they have much influence on <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>politics. There is significant tension among these three enclaves-the Hispanics, the Native Americans and the Caucasians-the Hispanics and Native Americans perceive themselves as vying for the same resources and, along with the Caucasians, struggling to assert their cultural and ethnic identities in public ways.</p>

<h2>Theoretical <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and methodology</h2>

<p>Our study was guided by two frameworks: <em>information habits</em> and <em>information grounds</em>.  Harris and Dewdney's (<a href="#Harris">1994</a>: 27) sixth principle of information behaviour was our first <span>framework</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  Based on an <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>review of decades of research on information seeking, they asserted that people follow deeply engrained patterns or habits in seeking information.  More specifically, they assert that people '...tend to seek information that is <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>accessible, preferably from interpersonal sources such as friends, <span>relatives</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>or co-workers rather than from institutions or organizations, unless (an important qualification) there is a particular reason for avoiding interpersonal sources'.  In summarizing 'eight lessons of information behaviour research', in his landmark text, <em>Looking for Information</em>, Case (<a href="#Case">2002</a>: 289) similarly explained that '...many people use formal sources rarely, relying <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>on informal sources such as friends and family, or knowledgeable colleagues at work'.  With Harris and Dewdney's principle in mind, we explored aspects of interpersonal information-seeking among migrant Hispanic farm workers and their <span>families</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Pettigrew's (<a href="#Pet98">1998</a>, <a href="#Pet99">1999</a>) <em>information ground</em> was the second <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that guided our study. Based on a social constructionist approach (c.f., <a href="#Touminen">
Touminen &amp; Savolainen, 1997</a>) and on her field work in several community-based social settings, Fisher (writing earlier as Pettigrew) identified and <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the concept of information <span>grounds</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> which she defined as synergistic '...environment[s] temporarily created when people come together for a singular purpose but from whose behavior emerges a social atmosphere that fosters the <span>spontaneous</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and serendipitous sharing of information' (<a href="#Pet99">Pettigrew, 1999</a>: 811).  She suggested that other information <span>grounds</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>might include such settings as barber shops and hair salons, quilting bees, playgrounds, tattoo parlors, metro buses, food banks, etc. (<a href="#Pet98">Pettigrew, 1998</a>).  In addition to more fully describing information <span>grounds</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in terms of key concepts and <span>propositional</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in a forthcoming paper, Fisher <em>et al.</em>, (<a href="#Fisher">2004</a>) assert that information <span>grounds</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>can be used, from a <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>or service <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> for facilitating the flow of everyday information, especially by drawing upon the attributes of particular social types such as opinion leaders and gatekeepers.</p>

<p>Thus, our exploratory study was guided by the following research questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What role does interpersonal information-seeking play in the lives of migrant Hispanic farm workers and their families?</li>
<li>What are the information <span>grounds</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of these workers and their families?</li>
<li>For what types of situations do these farm workers share information using what media?</li>
</ol>

<p>To carry out our field study, we used two Community Technology Centres (CTCs) that were expressly <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the year previous for educating the area's migrant farm working population.  Locally operated, the CTCs were <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>by a grant from the U.S. Department of Education Community Technology Centers programme, which was obtained by Educational Partnerships and Learning Technologies, a unit in the Provost's office at the University of Washington (UW) which expands the ways in which the University works with diverse communities and supports the use of technology in <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning.  The one-year grant was pursued in partnership with two <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>agencies, Radio KDNA and Horizon's Incorporated, which serve migrant farm workers and which agreed to take over the operation of these centres after one year.  Run by Hispanic or Spanish-speaking staff in and situated in premises with long-standing local histories, we <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that the CTCs would <span>prove</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>viable sites for data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>(we describe the CTC settings in depth below under <strong>Findings</strong>). In exchange for use of the CTCs as data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>sites we included evaluative questions regarding the users' <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of the CTCs. These questions  were used in an evaluative report for the U.S. Department of Education on the use of CTCs in this valley by migrant Hispanic farm workers and their <span>families</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Both <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and quantitative methods were used to collect data, including field observations on multiple occasions of both the CTCs and the surrounding communities, and thirty- to sixty-minute in-depth interviews with CTC users, staff, and administrators. The CTC intake and <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>data were also consulted.  Separate interview guides were used with the staff and the CTC users and were conducted in the language best <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>by the interviewees.  Staff interviews, which were conducted in <span>English</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> focused on CTC implementation, <span>difficulties</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> and impact on the <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> as well as staff's everyday information behaviour  and their <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of the local farm workers' information behaviour .  User interviews focused on the participants' <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of the CTCs and its negative and positive impacts, and their information habits and information <span>grounds</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  User interviews were often conducted in Spanish (utilizing <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>translation) to by-pass language barriers and facilitate better communication.  The <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and creation of the interview guides included a cultural awareness and sensitivity of the local population.  As we neared saturation toward the end of the study, we gave users self-administered, bilingual questionnaires with the same questions as for the user interviews.  These questionnaires were given to the CTC participants by the CTC staff and instructors.  In addition, CTC staff provided a sign-up sheet for participants to <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>their reasons for using the CTC, their ethnic and educational background, age and employment <span>status</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  As recommended by Chatman (<a href="#Chatman">1992</a>: 15), we maintained three types of notes <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the study: field notes (record of our observations and <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>as we interacted with participants), method notes (description of our techniques for collecting data), and theory notes (documentation of ideas and <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>with the study's theoretical frameworks, and other phenomena).  In total we interviewed or surveyed fifty-one CTC users and eight CTC staff.</p>

<p>The invitation to participate in the CTCs (and hence, our study) was initiated through normal news channels for this population-that is, the Radio KDNA, the newspapers, and personal communication.  As these populations began to use the CTCs they were asked to participate by completing information sheets about visit <span>purposes</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> and CTC staff began to note what types of questions and facilitations were most commonly requested by these populations.  Minority migrant farm worker populations are particularly difficult to use in studies because of their reluctance to participate in any type of research that might jeopardize or influence their working or immigration <span>status</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  Additionally, oral interviews of various CTC users were <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>but not audio-taped due to University of Washington <span>Human</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>Subject <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in working with an <em>at risk</em> population such as (often illegal) minority migrant farm workers.</p>

<p>In keeping with the study's naturalistic approach, we analyzed data as they were collected and <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>an <span>analytic</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>approach recommended by Lofland and Lofland (<a href="#Lofland">1995</a>) and Miles and Huberman (<a href="#Miles">1994</a>), which <span>consisted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of coding, memoing, and diagramming.  As a result, data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and analysis were an iterative process in which each round of analysis guided the purposive <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of more data, and each return from the field led to a closer understanding of the phenomena under study.  Data were analysed using Glaser and Strauss's (<a href="#Glaser">1967</a>) <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>comparative method where the analysis of data is combined with the generation of theoretical ideas, and is consistent with Strauss's (1998) 'coding from the data' methodology.  The resulting schemes reflected the data's emergent themes in accordance with the grounded theory approach and were additionally guided by the study's conceptual frameworks.  The resultant code book was used to assign terms to all segments in the ethnographic records that <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>particular concepts.</p>

<p>To ensure the trustworthiness (or, reliability and validity) of this study, we rigorously implemented measures recommended by Chatman (<a href="#Chatman">1992</a>) and Lincoln and <span>Guba</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#Lincoln">
1985</a>).  We ensured reliability through: (1) consistent note <span>taking</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> (2) <span>exposure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to multiple and different situations using triangulated methods, and (3) comparing emerging themes with <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>from studies on related phenomena. As a further means for ensuring reliability (or dependability in Lincoln and <span>Guba</span>' <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>s terms), we conducted intra-coder and inter-coder checks, and analyzed the data for incidents of observer effect. Validity was ensured by:</p> 

<ul>
<li>asking whether observations made 'sense because they fit into an <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>or <span>plausible</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>frame of <span>reference</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> (c.f., <a href="#Chatman">Chatman, 1992</a>: 12), </li>
<li>pre-testing instruments;</li> 
<li>prolonged field engagement;</li> 
<li>rigorous note taking;</li>
<li>triangulated methods;</li> 
<li>peer debriefing;</li> 
<li>negative case analysis; and</li> 
<li>member checks or participant verification.</li>
</ul> 

<p>Additionally, through this paper we are providing <em>thick description</em> (in accordance with external validity) of our methods and theory such that other researchers can determine whether our <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>can be compared with those of their own studies.  Learning and adopting participants' language&mdash;a standard element in conducting naturalistic research&mdash;greatly improved the efficiency of the studies and increased the trustworthiness of the data.  By employing open-ended, in-depth interviews and <span>observational</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>methods we listened to and adopted the participants' <span>languages</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> thus allowing for <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>interpretation from the participants' perspectives.  This also served to develop the iterative process of the interview language while preserving the conceptual value of the questions.</p>

<p>In the <span>remainder</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of this paper we share our <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>regarding farm workers' information behaviour, starting with a brief overview of the participants and the CTCs.</p>

<h2>The participants</h2>

<p>Our CTC-user and non-user interviewees ranged from under sixteen to sixty years of age. Most fell between seventeen and thirty years of age, and 57% were male.  Household sizes ranged from two to eleven people.  While the majority (58%) of participants was employed in the farming sector, others described themselves as <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> housewives, or clerks.</p>

<h2>The Community Technology Centres in context</h2>

<p>In September 2002, the U.S. Department of Education funded two CTCs in Granger and Sunny0e - both within the Yakima Valley <span>region</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  Granger, a 1.3 square mile town of about 2,500 people&mdash;85% of whom are Hispanic and 39.2% born <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the U.S.A&mdash;is surrounded by acres of fields and orchards with its nearest towns more than five miles away.  It has a small public library that provides some Spanish materials, though the Website is in <span>English</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  The median household income is below the state average while the unemployment rate above, and only 34.4% of the population have a high <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>diploma or higher.  The CTC is housed in the Northwest Communities Education Center (NCEC) in a historic building near the center of  town.  The building housing NCEC was built in the early part of the 20th century and is in <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>disrepair.   NCEC provides a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of services including <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>as a Second <span>Language</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>(ESL), General Educational <span>Development</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>(GED) and citizenship <span>classes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> health information, and legal and referral services from this building, and is con0ered a gathering place for information on a variety of services.  NCEC also operates the only public Spanish radio station, KDNA 91.9FM in the Pacific Northwest, which has been used for outreach and other services since 1979.  NCEC was a logical place to house the CTC with its base clientele of 12,000 while the radio station reaches over 60,000 listeners.  The second CTC is in new construction in downtown Sunny0e, a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of nearly 14,000 people with similar sociodemographic statistics to Granger.  The town is less isolated than Granger and it covers 5.9 square miles.  Horizon Incorporated, a non-profit organization that provides training and services to increase people's employment skills and enhance their potential, runs the CTC which is located in a public <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>district building near the district administrative headquarters.  Because Horizon Incorporated is experienced in working with people with disabilities and with educational and workforce development, its involvement in this project was a natural one.  Like Granger, the CTC comprises about twenty-five fully-loaded computers housed in a room that is open six days a week for <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and personal use.</p>

<p>According to the CTCs' statistics, approximately 196 people, ranging in age between sixteen and fifty-nine  with most falling between twenty-five and forty-four, have used them for various technology related endeavours.  Only four users were non-Hispanic.  Based on our interviews with fifty-one users as well as CTC staff, we learned that Granger was more heavily used for the purpose of very basic ESL and access to the Internet utilizing Spanish as the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>language of <span>choice</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  Sunny0e was particularly valued for providing its users with childcare as they gave credit to high <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>seniors who provided the childcare while their parent (in most cases the mother) attended <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that improved their <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>skills.  Users of both CTCs were eager to <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the benefits they <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>were brought about by the establishment of the CTCs in their communities.  They both spoke of improved confidence and communication skills as well as feeling a sense of trust and confidence in the centres to provide credible and important information that would be of use to them in their everyday lives.  This information included searching for higher paying jobs, learning <span>English</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> homework help, job training (especially as it related to <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>skills) and access to Spanish music and travel information.</p>

<p>The CTCs have had significant successes in providing <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>access to computers, <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>instruction.  This availability of cutting edge technology and training is positively affecting the lives of the people in these communities by giving them the opportunity to increase their literacy levels, technology and job skills in addition to creating a sense of <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  Parents were willing to allow their <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to come to the CTCs because they were already <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>with the organizations providing the CTCs and had an <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>level of trust in these agencies which increased the number of people who came to take advantage of the services.  In addition, the CTCs  also benefited the organizations in which they were housed.  While the location of the two centers within already <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>resource organizations increased the visibility of the CTCs and the opportunity for access, the CTCs were also increasing the visibility and use of the organizations as the word about the CTC services spread.</p>

<h2>Information habits and information grounds</h2>

<p>During the user interviews, we asked participants how they learned about the CTCs, whether they had told anyone else about the CTCs, where or to whom, in general, do they mostly turn when they need to find something out, why and for what reasons.  Non-CTC-users were similarly asked where they turn to satisfy everyday information needs.  Overwhelmingly, on all counts, our participants indicated that they prefer interpersonal sources.  For example, regarding how they learned about the CTCs, thirty participants cited an interpersonal <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>(family member, friend, or acquaintance), and fifteen said either a social service organization or the radio (i.e., KDNA), and one <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>cited the library. In terms of recommending the CTCs, only four people said that they had not done so, two of whom were first-time users.  When questioned about CTC benefits, <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>themes included being able to:</p> 

<ul>
<li>teach their <span>families</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>or pass on what they have learned,</li>
<li>communicate quickly and cheaply with their <span>families</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in Mexico by e-mail,</li> 
<li>communicate and translate important issues into <span>English</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> and</li> 
<li>help their <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>with homework.</li> 
</ul> 

<p>Two participants also explained that learning <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>has reduced their fear of going out and navigating the local services system. Learning <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>also reduced their dependence on others; for example, a woman said, 'I don't have to bother my <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>as much regarding the computers',  while another described how she can more <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>shop, fill in forms and do her banking.</p>

<p>Regarding their <em>information habits for everyday life</em>, respondents similarly <span>emphasized</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>interpersonal sources.  Asked as an open question during the interviews, the responses were coded using a set of pre-determined categories that were identified as viable during an earlier study.  Out of fifty-one CTC user responses, thirty-six (71%) cited an interpersonal <span>source</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> while <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>(14%) answered 'the Internet', and five (1%) indicated an organization such as the library.</p>

<p>In <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to, 'Why do you use this source?' CTC-user participants provided multiple answers that were coded using pre-determined categories (as described above).   The top responses <span>emphasized</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>reliability, ease of access, familiarity ('knows me and understands my needs'), and easy to use or communicate with.  Mentioned far less often, was a <span>source</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>s trustworthiness, expertise, or neutrality.  In total eighty-six responses were given and only four users did not answer the question.</p>

<p>In contrast, when queried about the drawbacks or pitfalls of their preferred information <span>source</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> only forty-seven responses were logged-despite again being able to provide multiple responses, and twelve of these participants claimed that there were no drawbacks to their sources.  The thirty-five <em>negative</em> <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>were evenly distributed among the following categories:</p>

<ul>
	  <li>not an expert on the topic</li>
	  <li>not able to communicate either face-to-face or in person</li>
	  <li>unreliable</li>
	  <li>not quick to access or contact</li>
	  <li>biased</li>
	  <li>does not allow them to be anonymous</li>
	  <li>does not provide emotional support</li>
	  <li>difficult to communicate with</li>
	  <li>get distracted or <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>while on the Internet</li>
	  <li>language barrier</li>
</ul>

<p>From our interviews with CTC staff and users we learned, unsurprisingly, that language is a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>barrier for immigrant <span>families</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> especially as most important <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>ranging from housing to <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>are written in <span>English</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  Thus, immigrants must find an <span>interpreter</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and, as we were told, the costs often outweigh the benefits of seeking information such that immigrants do not ask for help or they just wait until someone helpful comes along. Much of what is communicated to this population by the radio is in their native language; thus, the radio is often a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of defining where immigrants will go either to secure further information or find an <span>interpreter</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  Other barriers that we identified were consistent with those summarized by Fisher, <em>et al.</em>, (<a href="#Fisher">2004</a>: 759) as '...suspicion, language/literacy, loss of control, sense of being <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> and cultural value differences'.  Regarding cultural differences, for example, a Mexican immigrant might not seek food stamps and medical coupons for his family from the Department of <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>&amp; Health Services because in Mexican culture receiving such assistance would be a blow to his ego and mean that he is incapable of supporting his family.  Therefore, immigrants may not act upon information in deference to cultural <span>values</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  The radio station (which is housed in the same building as one of the CTCs) broadcasts assistance opportunities, yet staff said that cultural <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>often <span>limit</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>the impact of this type of information.</p>

<p>When asked, 'What are some examples of what this <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>usually provides?' the CTC users were less prolific and sixteen did not <span>respond</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> while sixteen indicated only general topics or miscellaneous items such as advice, 'how to behave', and information about products that are hard to find.  More specific answers ranged from where to find a job and income support; and getting help with <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>(reading <span>documents</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> correct pronunciation, translation, etc.); educational information about the GED or scholarships; recreational information, <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>help; legal information; homework help; and current events. </p>

<p>Regarding their <em>information grounds</em> only three people did not have a <span>response</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  The remaining forty-eight <span>emphasized</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><em>church</em>, <em>school</em> and the <em>workplace</em>.  Other responses ranged from the farmworkers' medical clinic, hair salons and barber shops, a day-care centre, a garage, the KDNA radio station (where, as we <span>observed</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> people do <em>hang out</em>), a bookstore, and a Pizza Hut.  Noticeably absent were food-oriented locales such as restaurants and coffee shops.  When asked to elaborate upon why their <em>ground</em> was a good place for obtaining information, the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>themes included: ease of communication, easy to communicate with people face-to-face, and people or sources are <span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and trustworthy.  Participants' descriptions of what they learned at their <em>grounds</em> varied widely, ranging from anything in general to gossip, current events, daily information and local history to family issues, <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>information, help with <span>English</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> employment, domestic violence, legal information, parenting, and recreation.  Of note, however, is that fourteen people who received the self-administered version of the interview guide did not <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to this question about what he/she received.</p>

<h2>Future research: <em>berrypicking</em> and interpersonal sources</h2>

<p>Similar to Harris and Dewdney (<a href="#Harris">1992</a>) and Case (<a href="#Case">
2002</a>), Johnson (<a href="#Johnson">1997</a>) emphasizes people's overall preference, in general, for interpersonal sources when seeking information.  Indeed, drawing upon Johnson, Case (<a href="#Case">2002</a>: 124-125) states that the use of other channels <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to be <span>predicted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>by the <i>social presence</i> they offer, that is, how much they are perceived as being like a face-to-face conversation with another <span>person</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> or as Johnson puts it, '...the extent to which they reveal the presence of other human interactants and can capture the human, feeling 0e of relationships' (<a href="#Johnson">1997</a>: 92).</p>

<p>Given the language, cultural, and economic barriers coupled with the deep extent of everyday needs associated with immigrants, especially those working in dangerous, low-tech occupations, it is consistent that they would rely heavily upon interpersonal information sources, especially close <span>families</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and friends or people like themselves, <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>credibility in the similarity of these populations.  However, immigrants have proven to be a difficult population to study and little has changed on the research front since Wilson's (<a href="#Wilson">1981</a>) observation that few researchers have focused in-depth on the informal transfer of information among individuals.</p>

<p>Findings from our interviews with CTC users and staff <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that immigrants may engage in a form of 'interpersonal <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>berrypicking'.  Expanding on Bates's (<a href="#Bates">
1989</a>: 3) berrypicking model where a 'user may identify useful information or references' at many different places in his or her query, the idea here is that immigrants use individuals in lieu of <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in formal information retrieval <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> and that their searches may apply over an entire lifetime as <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to a single effort or short series of efforts.  In other words, immigrants' berrypick information sources as they meet new people <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>their lives, and they work or get by with what they have until a new <em>berry</em> or information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>comes along.   In particular, however, we <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that immigrants are seeking a particular social type, i.e., instrumental referral agents&mdash;to borrow from Gourash (<a href="#Gourash">
1978</a>) and Harris and Dewdney (<a href="#Harris">1994</a>)&mdash;people whom they can befriend, thus becoming strong ties, and can connect them with needed information and other resources. This was manifested by immigrants using information they received from collegial sources who shared the same cultural interests and <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>such as the Hispanic Catholic Church <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>   In social networking terms (c.f., <a href="#Pet00">Pettigrew, 2000</a>), they want to create strong ties from their invaluable weak ties.  But how does this play out?</p>

<p>From interviews with participants, we learned that their <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>source of information were existing family, friends, or acquaintances who have already re0ed for months or years in the U.S.  This reflects Harris and Dewdney's (<a href="#Harris">1994</a>: 24) fourth principle of information behaviour, <span>namely</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that people 'frequently review their own experience first, then turn to people like themselves, including their friends and family'.  Other significant, interpersonal sources consist of church staff and members, co-workers and other people <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>by existing family and friends.  Through these referral agents immigrants learn about <span>schools</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> libraries and other agencies and institutions.  As we were told, immigrants do not usually <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>their entire family to a new country without knowing someone there already.  They leave Mexico without their <span>families</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>because they want to make sure they have somewhere to live and jobs, and they do not want to expose their <span>families</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>to unnecessary dangers of bringing them across.  Moreover, it is easier for men to survive the treacherous journey and to live with other men in a single apartment or shack, while trying to save money, and become comfortable with the new surroundings while sufficiently covering basic needs before bringing the family.  In these cases, the men, who do not have any family or trustworthy friends in the U.S., build information <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>at work, especially with fellow Mexicans who <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and have a family.  These new friends become the immigrant's <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>source of information and act as <span>interpreters</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  In keeping with the berrypicking analogy, immigrants work with what they have until a more knowledgeable or trustworthy acquaintance (or berry) came along.  When older <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>are enrolled in <span>school</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> for example, a bilingual teacher may become another useful <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>of information as s/he helps the <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>with homework and perhaps visits the family.  Schools with migrant programs further connect Mexican immigrant <span>families</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>by providing transportation to dental and medical visits.</p>

<p>Consistent with Chu's (<a href="#Chu">1999</a>) work on immigrant child mediators, one might hypothesize that that once immigrant <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>are comfortable <span>speaking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span><span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and have a good grasp of the language they will become their <span>families</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>information <span>source</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  New studies reaffirm the experience of these <span>families</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>that immigrant <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>perform adult or mature responsibilities and carry out bilingual conversations, often requiring sophisticated <span>vocabulary</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> Right after immigration, parents and <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>are at the same starting <span>line</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  Neither speaks <span>English</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span> but within a few years the <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>will have attended <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>and become fairly proficient in <span>English</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  At that point, the parents will turn increasingly to their <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>for help (<a href="#Chu">Chu, 1999</a>: 2).  CTC staff members described several incidents in which immigrant <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>cash checks, ask for directions, order food and complete <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>on behalf of their parents.  The flip-0e of this, however, is that the services provided by immigrant <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>may <span>ultimately</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>handicap the parents, as one staff member explained, '...ten <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>later the parents still rely on them to <span>interpret</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>  Younger siblings still <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>for the same situations that their brother did, the second oldest of ten.'  Parents relying solely on their <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>keep them from dealing <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:90px 30px 90px 30px;position:relative;">.</span>with the language, thus becoming one of the barriers.

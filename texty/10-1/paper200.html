<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Electronic communication forums such as mailing lists and discussion groups are frequently approached and described by using metaphors such as &quot;virtual communities&quot;, &quot;cyberspace colleges&quot;, and &quot;voluntary networks&quot; (Jones, <a href="#Jones">2003</a>: 43). These metaphors carry particular sets of assumptions about the function and significance of these forums. The metaphors imply the emergence of new social structures, new kinds of &quot;invisible colleges&quot;, and new senses of identity and connectedness triggered by them (Gl&auml;ser, <a href="#Glaser"> 2003</a>: 39). In addition, such metaphors imply that the enabling technologies determine social outcomes and user behavior, rather   than the social and cultural contexts into which they are embedded (Jones, <a href="#Jones">2003</a>: 42). </p>

<p>Community and network metaphors are often intrinsically linked to ethnomethodologically 
  informed, in-depth case studies of naturally occurring online communication in 
  non-institutional and non-organizational contexts. CMC is most often approached 
  by focusing on specific online spaces (cf. Liu, <a href="#Liu">1999</a>), user 
  communities (cf. Baym, <a href="#Baym">1997</a>), organizations (cf. Levy &amp; 
  Foster, <a href="#Levy">1998</a>) or disciplines (cf. Brown, <a href="#Brown">2001</a>). 
  The limitation of case studies is that they are often too culture-specific to 
  enable the development of broader explanatory models. In addition, the viewpoints 
  of non-users are often not equally well represented as those of users. </p>
  
<p>This study adopts a comparative approach to develop a theoretical understanding 
  of the factors affecting the use and perceived usefulness of scholarly mailing 
  lists.<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup> The cross-disciplinary approach may 
  seem an obvious choice in the study of mailing lists, since they are 
  usually more academic and professional in comparison to newsgroups, and since 
  earlier research has shown that there are important field differences in scholars' 
  information practices. Few studies have explored field differences in the use 
  of scholarly mailing lists, however (see <a href="#Herring02">Herring 2002</a>: 115-117). Studies 
  of scholarly mailing lists have focused on aspects such as the nature of scholarly 
  mailing lists as discussion forums (<a href="#Burton">Burton 1994</a>), topics 
  and contents of communications (<a href="#Berman">Berman 1996</a>; <a href="#Wildemuth">Wildemuth <i>et al</i>. 1997</a>), membership and message contribution 
  patterns (<a href="#Rojo">Rojo &amp; Ragsdale 1997</a>; <a href="#Sierpe">Sierpe 2000</a>), 
  communication norms (<a href="#Herring99">Herring 1999</a>), and perceived usefulness (<a href="#Brown">Brown 2001</a>).</p> 

  <p>Studies that have looked at field differences in the use of computer-mediated communication (<a href="Walsh96html.html">Walsh &amp; Bayma 1996</a>; <a href="Walsh00html.html">Walsh <i>et al</i>. 2000</a>; <a href="#Fry">Fry 2003</a>) have tended to focus on all forms. This paper adopts a more narrow focus, since, from an information-seeking-context viewpoint, personal e-mail and public 
  forums such as mailing lists are likely to serve distinct purposes. </p>

<h2>Earlier studies on scholarly mailing lists</h2>

<p> When electronic discussion lists emerged, they stimulated widespread expectations 
  for increased communication and collaboration among scholars that would also 
  result in increased productivity (cf. <a href="#Walsh00">Walsh <i>et al</i>. 2000</a>). They were, for instance, expected to: </p>
  
<blockquote> 
  <ul>
    <li>link those in need of information with the best sources of expertise,</li>
    <li>form links between scholars previously unknown to each other,</li>
    <li>enable discussion and knowledge sharing between academics and professionals 
      or citizens,</li>
    <li>make it easier for individuals and groups to exchange information and 
      ideas, and to cooperate in scholarly and educational endeavours, and</li>
    <li> extend the participatory base of &quot;invisible colleges&quot;. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
  
  
<p>When the use of scholarly mailing lists became more common and widespread, it became increasingly clear that few of these visions would be fulfilled (cf. <a href="#Finholt">Finholt 2002</a>: 76-77). The experience of building the Comserve electronic forum in communication studies (<a href="#Stephen">Stephen &amp; Harrison 1994</a>: 769) revealed a need to protect accomplished scholars from challenges to identity that might occur in encounters with novices or others who can not place them properly within existing disciplinary hierarchies. A number of studies  indicate that the adoption of computer-mediated communication tools has not changed the established systems or forums in which scholarly reputations are built and maintained (cf. Star &amp; Ruhleder, <a href="#Star">1994</a>; Kling &amp; McKim, <a href="#Kling">1999</a>), or enlarged nonelite scientists' access to &quot;invisible colleges&quot; (Finholt, <a href="#Finholt">2002</a>:  75). Rather, computer-mediated communication tools that are not well integrated into these systems tend to remain unused. Empirical studies also indicate that scholarly mailing lists may involve differential benefits for senior and junior and elite and nonelite scientists (cf. Doty <i>et al</i>., <a href="#Doty">1991</a>). Without equal benefits from information exchanges, senior scholars may withdraw their participation (<a href="#Doty">ibid</a>.).</p>

<p>In their study of the use of academic discussion lists in social sciences and humanities, Rojo and Ragsdale (<a href="#Ragsdale">1997</a>) noted the fragility of users' binding to these forums. This was manifest in transient membership and the general preference for a broadcasting recipient, rather than contributor, role. Messages were not, in general, deemed very important (<a href="#Rojo">ibid</a>.). In a study of the use of mailing list by music scholars, Brown (<a href="#Brown">2001</a>) similarly observed a high rate of discontinuance, lack of active participation, and strong evidence for scholars' growing disenchantment with the value of this 
innovation for research purposes. </p>
  
  <p>The next section reviews studies that explicitly focus on disciplinary differences 
  in the use and uptake of computer-mediated communication.</p>
  
<h2>Comparative studies</h2>

<p>Walsh and Bayma (<a href="#Bayma">1996</a>) examined the uptake and use of 
  computer-mediated communication across four scientific domains, mathematics, physics, chemistry and experimental biology by using in-depth interviews, and found significant differences in the use of computer-mediated communication across disciplines. The use of bulletin boards and distribution lists was common in mathematics and physics, but much less common in experimental biology and chemistry. Mathematicians and physicists used computer-mediated communication for informal communication, 
  while chemists and experimental biologists limited their use of computer-mediated communication to formal communication, to seeking information from online databases. They found the 
  following factors influential in determining patterns of computer-mediated communication use:</p>
  
<blockquote> 
  <ul>
    <li>size of research field (large/small),</li>
    <li>market penetration, </li>
    <li>locus of critical information and degree of interdependence between research 
      units, and</li>
    <li>technical limitations (Walsh &amp; Bayma, <a href="#Walsh">1996</a>:  
      689).</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Researchers in small fields are, according to Walsh and Bayma (<a href="#Bayma">ibid</a>., 
  p. 689), able to filter relevant literature through their knowledge of authors, 
  while in large expansive fields information scanning takes place in the formal 
  domain. They argue that the sharing of information in mailing lists is less 
  desirable in market-penetrated fields such as chemistry and experimental biology. 
  The locus of critical information in mathematics is the like-minded colleague, 
  while in experimental biology, critical information is located primarily in 
  the laboratory. In experimental biology, each research team is able to gather 
  within its lab the set of materials and expertise needed to study a problem 
  (<a href="#Bayma">ibid</a>.:  691). Technical limitations mean that photos 
  and drawings, for instance, are more difficult to translate electronically.</p>
<p>Through in-depth interviews, Fry (<a href="#Fry">2003</a>) studied patterns 
  of computer-mediated communication uptake and use across three specialties: high-energy physics, social/cultural 
  geography and corpus-based linguistics. According to Fry (<a href="#Fry">2003</a>, 
  pp. 19-20), the factors shaping patterns of computer-mediated communication uptake and use include, for 
  instance:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <ul>
    <li>nature of intellectual territory (extent of interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity),</li>
    <li>concentrations of critical mass, levels and nature of competition,</li>
    <li>character of personal networks (close-knit or loose-knit) and extent of 
      personal network ties, </li>
    <li>nature of work organization in formal collaborations (locally/centrally 
      organized), and</li>
    <li>physical proximity of personal networks and collaborative activities.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Fry also noticed the differential dependence upon formal and informal communication. 
  The physicists in Fry's study were heavy users of the centralised pre-print 
  archive arXiV.org, while social/cultural geographers rarely used electronic 
  databases to locate literature. Physicists engaged in centrally organized formal 
  collaborations used collaboration-wide newsgroups, but their use of community-wide 
  mailing lists was limited. Social/cultural geographers subscribed to mailing 
  lists, because they were in a marginal position within their parent discipline, 
  and often the sole representatives of their specialty within their departments. 
  Corpus-based linguists considered online networks such as discussion lists to 
  be part of their personal network due to the scarcity of researchers in this 
  domain. </p>
  
<p>Walsh and Bayma's and Fry's studies focussed on several forms of computer-mediated communication. In a 
  study that explored the patterns of use of e-journals and databases across domains, 
  Talja and Maula (<a href="#Talja">2003</a>) explained field variation by the 
  following interrelated domain factors: </p>

<blockquote> 
  <ul>
    <li>primary search method (directed searching, browsing, linking), <sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup></li>
    <li>domain size (density of the universe of relevant documents),<sup><a href="#note3">3</a></sup></li>
    <li>degree of scatter within a field (low/high),</li>
    <li>primary relevance criteria (topical/paradigmatic), and </li>
    <li>book versus article orientation. </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Talja and Maula found that although most scholars use a mix of different search 
  strategies, there are clear differences in the relative importance of these 
  methods across fields. Talja's and Maula's study corroborated earlier findings 
  (cf. Green, <a href="#Green">2000</a>) according to which for humanities scholars 
  browsing and chaining are often more effective techniques for identifying relevant 
  literature than directed (descriptor-based searching). The findings supported 
  the hypothesis presented by Bates (<a href="#Bates02">2002</a>:  148) according 
  to which scholars in very densely and sparsely populated research areas rely 
  more on browsing and linking to identify relevant documents. Walsh and Bayma 
  (<a href="#Bates96">1996</a>) and Fry (<a href="#Fry">2003</a>) similarly noted 
  the effect of field size on patterns of computer-mediated communication use. </p>
<p>The degree of scatter and degree of interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity 
  of a domain also influence information seeking patterns (Bates, <a href="#Bates96">1996</a>) 
  and computer-mediated communication use. Scholars in low scatter fields are served by a small number of highly specialised journals, whereas in high scatter fields, relevant materials 
  are dispersed across several disciplines and published in a large number of 
  different journals (<a href="##Packer">Packer &amp; Soergel 1979</a>; Bates, <a href="#Bates96">1996</a>). Scatter is also related to the extent to which a field&#8217;s underlying principles are well developed, to the extent to which the literature of the field is well 
  organized in the light of scholars' research interests and problems, and to 
  the breadth and clarity of the demarcations around the subject area (Mote, <a href="#Mote">1962</a>). 
</p>

<p>Talja and Maula found field differences in information seeking patterns to 
  be related also to differences in relevance criteria, and the nature of the 
  research object. In humanities specialties such as media and cultural studies 
  where research objects and problems could be constructed differently from diverse 
  viewpoins, information seekers commonly attached their search strategies to 
  particular conversations or paradigms. In such fields, the choice of theories 
  or methodological approaches limits or widens the range of materials considered 
  as relevant independently of the topic or phenomenon studied. In natural sciences, 
  research objects are usually more stable and standardised, and searches are 
  more commonly focused on the phenomenon or substance being studied. The distinction 
  between topical and paradigmatic relevance resembles Walsh and Bayma's distinction 
  between &quot;author-based filtering&quot; and &quot;formal scanning&quot;, 
  and Fry's &quot;nature of intellectual territory&quot;. </p>
  
<p>Talja's and Maula's study also showed differences in e-journal and database 
  use patterns in fields where books carried the most prestige and were regarded 
  as the most important sources and contributions in comparison to fields where 
  peer-reviewed articles were considered as the major contributions and most important 
  sources. The relative importance of books versus articles may also affect mailing 
  list use patterns, since Talja (<a href="#Talja">2002</a>) found that book-oriented 
  scholars mainly share interpretations of documents, while scholars in fields 
  where peer-reviewed articles are the most important sources share the relevant 
  documents (directly), and information about document retrieval methods.</p>
<p>In summary, the studies reviewed above point to the differential roles of formal 
  and informal communication across fields. These studies identified central factors 
  that may be utilised in an empirically founded, multifaceted explanatory approach. 
  We may thus hypothesise that the following factors are likely to impact the 
  use and perceived usefulness of scholarly mailing lists: primary search methods, 
  collaboration patterns, physical proximity of like-minded colleagues, field 
  size, degree of scatter, loci of critical information, the desirability of sharing
  information in public or semi-public discussion forums, relevance criteria, and 
  book versus article orientation.</p>

<h2>The empirical study</h2>
<p>Based on semi-structured interviews, this study explores the role of scholarly 
  mailing lists across four domains: nursing science, literature and cultural 
  studies, history, and environmental biology. The empirical data was gathered 
  in 2000 by qualitative thematic interviews of forty-four scholars representing two Finnish 
  universities, one having a strong natural sciences orientation, and the other 
  a social sciences and humanities orientation. The data on the role of scholarly 
  mailing lists were gathered as part of a larger project, Academic IT cultures, 
  that focused on scholars' use of networked resources. Scholarly mailing lists 
  were one of the themes explored in the interviews. The interviews were designed 
  to gain detailed qualitative data on scholars' work and information practices 
  in the chosen fields. As argued by Paisley (1968:  4), the use of any specific 
  information source or medium cannot be adequately understood without taking 
  into account all the available sources and channels and their potentially divergent 
  roles and values. The fact that the overall study did not focus solely on mailing 
  lists strengthens, rather than weakens, the credibility of the results, because 
  the viewpoint of non-users is equally well represented as that of users. </p>
<p>The aim of the selection of fields for the study was to enable comparisons 
  between natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences. Environmental biology 
  represents a laboratory science. History and literature are humanities fields, 
  whereas media and cultural studies is an inter- and multidisciplinary field. 
  Nursing science is an interdisciplinary field drawing on medical and social 
  sciences. </p>
<p>Two humanities fields are represented in the study because among humanities 
  scholars it was easiest to find both non-users of electronic networks and researchers 
  involved in digital library and web publishing projects. Individual participants 
  were chosen on the basis of the information given in departmental and individual 
  researchers' homepages to represent differing research orientations and levels 
  of research experience (see Table 1). During the interview series, understandings 
  of field-specific information practices gained from the first interviews were 
  used as grounds of comparison in subsequent interviews. This procedure enabled 
  us to gain a sufficiently reliable picture of practices that were common to 
  a field as well as variations related to topic or specialty. Of the forty-four participants, 
  twenty-two are men and twenty-two women. <br />

<p>The interviews lasted an average of approximately one and a half hours. They were tape-recorded and transcribed in full for analysis. Data about the use of different types of computer and computer-mediated communication applications were also gathered by a separate short questionnaire. The recorded interview transcripts were coded and analysed thematically  and interpreted by conducting comparisons across fields, specialisms and individual responses. The quantitative results are not generalisable in a statistical sense,   rather, their role is to illustrate field differences. The limitation of the study is that because the number of respondents in each field is small (as mandated by the qualitative approach and the work involved in analysing qualitative data), it cannot provide reliable information about precise levels of use of mailing lists in the studied fields. Instead, the data enables an understanding of their relative value from the participants' point of view. </p>

<p>The specific reseach questions are:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <ul>
    <li>What are the perceived advantages and disadvantages of mailing lists? 
    </li>
    <li>For what purposes are mailing lists used?</li>
    <li>What are the reasons for non-use?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>As shown in Table 2, there were clear differences in patterns of mailing list use between the two humanities fields and nursing science and environmental biology. </p>

<h3>Environmental biology</h3>
<p>Two environmental biologists subscribed to international mailing lists, but one
   was considering unsubscribing. Some others in this field had 
  previously subscribed to mailing lists, but had estimated lists to be of limited 
  usefulness in relation to the time and effort they required for handling and 
  deleting incoming mail. One scholar explained that: </p>
  
<blockquote>the most useful feature was information about international meetings. That 
  was useful, but the messages started to get so miscellaneous that there was 
  no sense in it any more. (Senior researcher)</blockquote>
  
<p>The most useful feature of mailing lists for environmental biologists was information 
  about international meetings. Scholars in this field had little appreciation 
  for the communicative, community-building, or networking potentials of mailing 
  lists. Nor did they report having acquired useful information about publications 
  through mailing lists. </p>
<blockquote>I am a subscriber of the X.X<sup><a href="#note4">4</a></sup> list. Maybe once a week I get a really useful 
  message containing information that I need. In principle it is a really good 
  forum for sharing information, but the fact that some people use it for conversing 
  with each other makes it a bad system and really annoying from time to time. 
  (Junior researcher)</blockquote>
  
<p>Environmental biologists generally work in groups in which research priorities 
  are set, experiments are planned, research techniques and results are discussed, 
  and information about relevant documents are shared. The kind of collaborations 
  these scholars were heavily involved in were primarily local and national in 
  nature. In this respect, they differed from the kind of close-knit international 
  collaborations typical for, for instance, the high-energy physicists in Fry's 
  (<a href="#Fry">2003</a>) study who used collaboration-wide mailing lists as a means of keeping 
  partners up-to-date about the progression of the project. The local research 
  group and laboratory was the locus of critical information for environmental 
  biologists. The one environmental biologist who did find mailing lists useful 
  differed from her colleagues in one important respect: the colleagues in the 
  research groups she belonged to were situated not in her workplace, but in other 
  institutions. Thus, the lack of physical proximity of colleagues with exactly 
  matching interests explains this &quot;deviant&quot; case among environmental 
  biologists. She also differed from her colleagues in that she described her 
  research interests as &quot;relatively wide&quot; and therefore as requiring 
  also journal scanning, and not solely relying on descriptor-based searching. 
</p>

<p>Environmental biologists rarely browsed. Peer-reviewed journal articles were 
  the most important sources for them. They searched relevant material and also 
  monitored their field through conducting directed descriptor-based searches 
  in electronic databases and the <em>Current Contents</em> CD-ROM that they described as 
  containing all the core journals of their field. After having located relevant 
  articles in databases, they could approach their authors by requesting copies. 
  This practice could sometimes generate contacts between scholars working with 
  similar topics, but conferences were described as the main avenue for building 
  professional networks and for sharing experiences. </p>

<h3>Nursing science</h3>

<p>Three nursing scientists subscribed to national or international mailing lists. 
  All three found the lists to some extent useful for monitoring current discussions, 
  but they read the messages only if they had time to spare: </p>
  
<blockquote>Mailing lists are to some extent useful. X.X. helps me in keeping abreast with 
  current discussions, what issues are found as deserving attention, but I mainly 
  look at the headings, and delete the messages, or, if they are interesting, 
  read them. When a lot of messages come from the list I simply delete them all 
  without reading. (Junior researcher)</blockquote>
  
<p>The subscribers' research was directly related to the issues discussed in the 
  list, and this was the reason for its subscription. After having familiarised 
  themselves with this medium, most nursing scientists had decided they did not 
  need it. Reflecting the general view of nursing scientists, one of the subscribers 
  explained that all information activities should have a clear goal and clear 
  gains, and she was considering quitting the list. There was a clear lack of 
  fit between nursing scientists' information practices and mailing lists as information 
  communication technologies. </p>
  
<p>Both nursing scientists and environmental biologists place a high value on 
  systematic literature review: using a rigorous non-biased methodology to collect 
  all topically relevant peer-reviewed articles, extracting information from those 
  articles and synthesising the results. Especially clinically oriented nursing 
  scientists have to relate their research to the medical knowledge base. Nursing 
  scientists searched and monitored literature mainly through conducting keyword 
  searches in &quot;official bibliographic databases&quot; such as Cinahl and 
  Medline. As nursing science is an interdisciplinary and high scatter field, 
  scholars in this field preferred to use aggregated e-journal databases that 
  enable searching across fields. </p>
  
<p>Local research groups and their members were the loci of critical information 
  also for nursing scientists. Although nursing scientists' research topics are 
  more variable than those of environmental biologists, various topics are streamlined 
  to research groups or longitudinal close-knit projects binding together scholars 
  within a nursing specialty (e.g., nursing education, preventive nursing research). 
  Literature, ideas, advice, and support were available to nursing scientists 
  within these groups. </p>

<h3>History and literature and cultural studies</h3>

<p> Eight out of the eleven literature and cultural studies scholars interviewed 
  subscribed to mailing lists, and seven out of eleven historians. Humanities 
  scholars generally had a much more positive view of mailing lists and their 
  usefulness than scholars in the other fields studied. The non-subscribers (7/22) 
  were either non-users or low users of electronic communication media. They worked 
  in research areas (e.g., Finnish literature) where access to the Internet and its 
  resources was relatively unimportant because of the scarcity of networked resources 
  directly relevant for their research. Especially scholars specialised in Finnish 
  history and Finnish literature work in sparsely populated research areas (they 
  are searchers of &quot;needles in haystacks&quot;, Bates, <a href="#Bates02">2002</a>), 
  and their primary search methods are browsing and linking. For these scholars, 
  mailing lists are valuable in that they amplify and extend these search methods. 
  For instance, one historian said that mailing lists &quot;help me to find my 
  way to relevant Websites&quot;. </p>
  
<p>For senior scholars in sparsely populated research areas, manual browsing through 
  catalogues, archives and books was supplemented by browsing through personal 
  networks in the hope of finding relevant material. Mailing list were seen as 
  valuable because they provide a corresponding opportunity for social browsing 
  and information encountering: </p>
  
<blockquote>I have had the opportunity to go to international conferences, so I know the 
  names of the people who are studying these issues and am acquainted with a number 
  of them. Through them I get to know if someone has published something that 
  is worth checking. Also through mailing lists I get information about relevant 
  sources. (Junior scholar, literature and cultural studies)</blockquote>
  
<p>The scholar cited above also explained that &quot;I do not really use article 
  databases, because I know that there does not exist much literature on my topic, 
  and most of the existing literature represents a different viewpoint, it is 
  social scientific and not my stuff&quot;. Information about relevant material 
  received through the mailing list he subscribed to could, in turn, be trusted 
  to represent &quot;the right viewpoint&quot;. Lists were thus also a means of 
  social and collaborative literature filtering, and provided access to groups 
  in which epistemic and methodological positions are built and discussed:</p>
  
<blockquote>I do not search literature through keyword searches, that would sink me in 
  a swamp. I use old-fashioned methods, looking at the references in other studies, 
  and technology enables me to follow international mailing lists and the discussions 
  going on in them. Lists focussed on a specialty or a specific issue provide 
  me information about new literature. Libraries' databases are not, at least 
  in our field, valid in the sense that you could find what you are looking for 
  by using index terms. (Junior scholar, literature and cultural studies)</blockquote>
  
<p>Many humanities scholars subscribed to several mailing lists. One media and 
  cultural studies scholar, for example, subscribed to lists in the fields of 
  communication, cultural studies and film studies. Especially media and cultural 
  studies scholars often had a wide range of interests, and they viewed directed 
  subject searches as requiring too narrow and limited a focus. </p>
  
<p>Mailing lists were not only perceived as useful for encountering information 
  on the scholars own topic. Most historians and many literary scholars subscribed 
  to a national list called &quot;The History Network&quot; that publishes reviews 
  of humanities and social sciences books. This list was seen as providing an 
  opportunity to monitor new literature and the domain more widely: </p>
  
<blockquote>Lists provide information that is for the most part useful for my work. Book 
  reviews, etc. Lists are not central for seeking material, but for keeping in 
  touch. (Senior researcher, history)</blockquote>
  
<p>Humanities scholars also saw lists as useful for keeping in touch with research 
  lines, &quot;what people are doing&quot;, or &quot;what is now current&quot;. 
  Some humanities scholars said that lists provide ideas and intellectual stimulation, 
  however, they also reported that the need for stimulation and responsiveness 
  to others' ideas varies greatly according to the phase of research. Ideas were 
  welcome in the initiation phase, while during writing and ending phases (<a href="#Ellis">Ellis 1993</a>) lists could be experienced as a disturbance. </p>
  
<blockquote>If you have been away, you may have 300 new e-mails. I pretty soon gave the 
  lists up, although I have resubscribed to some of them and then unsubscribed 
  from them again. It depends on my mood and mental state whether I want to get 
  stimulation from others, or whether I do not want any distraction. (Junior researcher, 
  literature and cultural studies)</blockquote>
  
<p>While all nursing scientists, environmental biologists, and historians who 
  subscribed to mailing lists preferred the recipient role, some literary and 
  cultural studies doctoral students also participated in the communications and 
  sharing of information concerning publications in the lists. However, also literature 
  and cultural scholars studies saw the provision of information concerning conferences 
  and other incoming events as the primary and most useful function of mailing 
  lists. </p>
  
<p>Even humanities scholars who did subscribe to mailing lists did not deem their 
  messages very important, and were not committed to them. When busy, they discarded 
  all messages without reading them. Humanities scholars easily joined lists and 
  permanently or temporarily resigned from them if they experienced e-mail or 
  work overload. One indicator of the greater usefulness of mailing lists to humanities 
  scholars in comparison to the other two fields studied, was, however, that many 
  of them had developed systems for managing group mail. For instance, to prevent 
  the overflowing of their regular e-mail, some had acquired a separate e-mail 
  address for list e-mail, and some automatically re-routed list e-mail to a folder. 
  Both practices were designed to enable the rapid effective scanning of list 
  mail at a convenient moment.</p>
  
<p>History and literature and cultural studies are fields where the range of topics 
  studied is wide. Many historians and literary scholars were the only representatives 
  of their specialist fields in their departments and universities. In the past, 
  conferences and seminars provided these scholars the only opportunity to discuss 
  their work with colleagues with similar interests. Mailing lists were especially 
  important for scholars who were the sole experts in their specialty in their 
  home institution (or their home country). They were experienced as relieving 
  the loneliness of research work, and providing an opportunity to maintain a 
  sense of the international progress of the field. </p>
  
<p>In general, doctoral students were more avid subscribers of mailing lists than 
  professors. A professor in history expressed the view that mailing lists are 
  invaluable especially for doctoral students not located in their home institutions. 
  He saw that mailing lists provide the geographically dispersed history scholars 
  a place where they can become aware of each other and ongoing projects. </p>
  
<h2>The differential role and use of formal and informal communication media across 
  fields </h2>
  
<p>This study corroborated earlier findings (<a href="#Walsh">Walsh &amp; Bayma 1996</a>) 
  indicating that in fields with heavy reliance on &quot;formal scanning&quot; 
  and directed subject searches, mailing lists are not perceived as useful sources 
  of materials or advice. Nursing scientists and environmental biologists generally 
  saw little value in mailing lists for research purposes. They placed a strong 
  emphasis on systematic literature reviews, and had little appreciation for discussion, 
  debate, and sharing of information and ideas in public or semi-public forums. </p>
  
<p>For humanities scholars, sharing interpretations of documents is a central 
  part of research practice. Humanities scholars are often &quot;author-filterers&quot; 
  (<a href="#Walsh">Walsh &amp; Bayma 1996</a>) and conversation-oriented seekers 
  for whom the locus of critical information is the like-minded colleague. History 
  and literary studies scholars subscribed to mailing lists and followed them 
  substantially more often also because they work in fields where the range of 
  topics studied is wide and scholarly communities are geographically dispersed. 
  In comparison, in enviromental biology, scholars in one institution focus on 
  a few topics and research lines. For environmental biologists and nursing scientists 
  local research groups and collaborative projects were the loci of critical information. 
</p>
<p>Even mailing lists that covered a relatively narrow range of interests had 
  not - in any field studied - created direct contacts between researchers sharing 
  similar interests. All the partipants in this study reported that they had created 
  their personal and international scholarly contacts and networks mainly in conferences 
  and seminars, and that these contacts were later kept up by personal e-mail. 
  Thus, although the discussions going on in scholarly mailing lists may resemble 
  the discussions in conferences (Burton, <a href="#Burton">1994</a>), and in 
  the same way may provide an opportunity for monitoring current research lines, 
  scholars' networks and invisible colleges still rely on face-to-face contacts. 
  Little evidence was found in this study of mailing lists' ability to forge links 
  between scholars. Rather, this study corroborated the findings of earlier studies 
  concerning the fragility of scholars' binding to these forums. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p> Contrary to the widespread assumption in computer-mediated communication studies (often leaning on virtual 
  community metaphors), sociability and social presence were not very desirable 
  features in scholarly mailing lists. Scholars were more likely to unsubscribe 
  from high-traffic mailing lists containing discussion and debate than low-traffic 
  lists that were restricted to queries and announcements. Even humanities scholars 
  who experienced mailing lists as useful for keeping updated in current discussions 
  and monitoring literature easily unsubscribed from lists when they experienced 
  information overload. The disadvantages of mailing lists in terms of time required 
  for reading and handling messages, and the challenge for developing an effective 
  personal e-mail management system easily overweighed their benefits. The preferred 
  type of mailing list was a message board providing information about conferences 
  and other events, and new publications.</p>
<p>As a cross-disciplinary comparative study, this study contributed to the understanding 
  of the factors underlying the use and perceived usefulness of scholarly mailing 
  lists. This study filled a gap on existing research on scholarly mailing lists 
  by applying an information seeking in context perspective, which enabled an 
  understanding of the role of mailing lists in the context of various sources 
  and channels available to scholars. In the context of information seeking research, 
  this study contributed to the body of empirical research seeking to identify 
  factors that explain variation in scholars' information practices. Many classic 
  and contemporary works embed scholars' information practices within the overarching 
  context of disciplinary differences, and aim at forming holistic understandings 
  of scholars' work and communication practices. However, not many attempts have 
  been made to develop a more systematic comparative approach for explaining scholars' 
  information practices. Building on earlier studies (Walsh &amp; Bayma, <a href="#Walsh">1996</a>; 
  Fry, <a href="#Fry">2003</a>; Talja &amp; Maula, <a href="#Talja">2003</a>) 
  the present study applied a multifaceted empirically grounded framework. The 
  framework also provides tools for characterising and comparing the features 
  of sub-domains. For example, in fields such as history there are several specialties 
  where the significance of mailing lists may vary. Comparative studies that enable 
  a deeper understanding of scholarly communities and their information practices 
  can significantly help in designing information systems to meet the needs of 
  those communities. </p>

<h2><a name="notes" id="notes"></a>Notes</h2>
<p> <a name="note1"></a>1. Electronic discussion lists - also called distribution 
  lists, mailing lists, or listservs - distribute e-mail messages posted to a 
  listserver (or listserv) to a list of subscribers. Discussion lists, like e-mail, 
  are textual and asynchronous. Their function is to enable the transmission of 
  information to multiple recipients (subscribers) simultaneously and to enable 
  the exchange of ideas on a certain subject area. Typical categories of contents 
  in discussion lists are: a) announcements: information about training courses, 
  initiatives, conferences, seminars and publications, b) queries: requests for 
  information, query responses, and c) discussion of issues (Berman, <a href="#Berman">1996</a>; 
  Wildemuth <i>et al</i>., <a href="#Widemuth">1997</a>). There are three types 
  of mailing lists: a) moderated lists, where messages are filtered by a person 
  who approves them for distribution, b) digest lists, where the messages are 
  compiled by a list owner or moderator and sent to subscribers periodically, 
  and c) unmoderated lists, where every posting sent to the list goes directly 
  to receivers. Mailing lists may include &#8220;from one to many&#8221;, &#8220;from 
  many to one&#8221; and &#8220;from many to many&#8221; communication (Savolainen, 
  <a href="#Savolainen">2001</a>, pp. 69-70). In the case of &#8220;from one to 
  many&#8221;, a person addresses a question to other participants. In the case 
  of &#8220;from many to one&#8221;, several participants answer the question. 
  &#8220;Many to many&#8221; type communication may manifest itself in that several 
  people forming a group approach others to communicate a viewpoint or to seek 
  information.<br />
  <a name="note2" id="note2"></a>2. Directed searching means doing subject searches 
  by using databases whose materials have been indexed, catalogued and classified, 
  and which provide elaborate retrieval (e.g., free-text search) capabilities 
  (Bates, <a href="#Bates02">2002</a>:  142). Browsing may be conducted either 
  individually or socially through formal or informal collaboration, and it can 
  be either purposive and directed or undirected and random (e.g., information 
  encountering on the web). Linking may involve following the links provided in 
  the web or chaining by following the references of seed documents (Bates, <a href="#Bates02">2002</a>).<br />
  <a name="note3" id="note3"></a>3. Domain size refers to the amount of relevant 
  documents available in a search space or domain in relation to all materials 
  in the area (Bates, <a href="#Bates02">2002</a>).<br />

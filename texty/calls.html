<p>The fourth <strong><em>ISIC Conference</em></strong> in Lisbon will be an opportunity to hear results of the latest research in the field of information seeking, to debate methodological issues and to discuss emerging and further areas of research.</p>

<p>All participants of the previous ISIC Conferences are welcome in 2002 in Lisbon and we hope that many other researchers from information related fields will also be attracted.</p>

<p>The themes of the conference will be:</p>

<li>Research approaches and methodologies;</li>
<li>Information seeking in specific contexts, e.g, health care, education etc.;</li>
<li>Organizational structures and processes and information seeking: the impact of structures and processes on ISB of organizational members, and the relationship of ISB to work tasks and their
complexity;</li>
<li>Information behaviour in every day life, i.e., information seeking to support citizenship, parenting, career development, etc. Including its role in community activities and processes (including the role of
the Web in supporting such behaviour and the development of virtual communities);</li>
<li>Integrating studies on information seeking and retrieval, i.e, research into the relationship between information searching and retrieval and the broader field of information seeking, including the role of Web-based searching in the overall information seeking process;</li>
<li>Information use - how information is used to help solve the original problem or satisfy the initial need.</li></ol>

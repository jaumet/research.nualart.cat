  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <blockquote><i>'The library, as we know it, is obsolescent … The university, 
    as we know it, is obsolescent … Your kind [ Librarians], and mine 
    [Universities], are clearly at some kind of fork in our road … We must 
    either lead, follow, or get out of the way!'</i> : <br>N. Langenburg, 
  (1)</blockquote>
  
<p>  In the brave new on-line world facing libraries and <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> 
  an important component is the availability of learning materials and IT 
  support for access to these materials. However, to fully support learners, yet 
  more is needed. </p>
  
  <p>In general terms, the "more" <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to the structure within which learning 
  takes place for each learner - commonly known as the curriculum - and support 
  for each student as he or she progresses through their learning. How best to 
  provide this holistic concept of networked learner support is a complex 
  question with educational, organisational and technical components, to which 
  we do not yet have the answers. </p>
  
  <p>To help <span>derive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>some answers the Learning Environment Club was <span>formed</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> The 
  club <span>consisted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of eleven Further Education colleges, together with a <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>
  supplier and some associate institutions (2). Whilst the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>was on FE, the 
  principles of the Club's work are applicable to all sectors of <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> The 
  remit was to: </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Ascertain key requirements for successful online support of the entire 
    learning process. 
    <li>Develop and evaluate <span>prototype</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>Learning Environment <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>which 
    fulfils these requirements. 
    <li>Identify the best ways of fitting this kind of technology into the 
    institutions' <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to maximise benefits and minimise problems. 
  </li></ul>
  
<p>  The Club has run from July, 1995 to May, 1997, and trialling is 
  continuing through to 1998. </p>
  
  <p>There has been a fair amount of other work addressing various aspects of 
  online learning. The <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>differentiating <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the Learning Environment 
  collaboration has been our holistic approach, with the online resource base at 
  the centre of the model. 
  </p>
  <h2>Key Requirements which were Identified</h2>
  
<p>  These requirements were derived 
  in a series of workshops with Club members (a mixture of information 
  specialists (librarians), tutors, senior college managers, IT support people 
  and curriculum planners): </p>
  
  <p>1) Full support for a resource-based, student-centred open learning model. 
  This implies: </p>
  <p>1a) Making learning materials available to learners in two ways: </p>
  <blockquote>- Through research. The learner locates them him/herself - 
    through searching and browsing - with the resource itself available online - 
    not just the catalogue record (as well as retaining access to books, videos 
    etc. which are not <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>online). <br>- Guided learning - structured <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>
    access to the learning materials which are at the core of each learner's 
    programme of study. This includes both standard materials for the programme 
    of learning which the learner is pursuing, and materials <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in by a tutor 
    to meet the individual needs of a learner.</blockquote>
  <p>1b) Further <span>extending</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>support to the entire learning process, which was 
  defined for our <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>1. (See also (3).) </p>
  

  <div align="center"><img alt="<span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>1"   height=247 src="bnkfig1.gif" width=421></div>
   <div align="center"><br><strong>Fig. 1 - Learning model for the individual learner</strong></div>
  
  <p>In this model, planning and reflection, with the student <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>
  responsibility for his or her own learning are seen as integral to learning. </p>
  
  <p>1c) Embedding online communication / discussion within the core structure 
  of the learning. </p>
  <p>2) Flexibility is of the essence, both in meeting the individual needs of 
  learners, and adapting the institution's offering rapidly as needs change. 
  This means meeting the needs of individual learners by, for example, support 
  for individually tailored learning programmes, with the capability to provide 
  the learning resources that are just right for a particular individual, and to 
  change these immediately as the needs of the individual (or group) change. 
  <br>It also implies adapting the institution's offering as needs change - not 
  just on a <span>fixed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>annual cycle. So, for example, existing courses can quickly be 
  adapted to meet the needs of a customer organisation for a particular kind of 
  training for it's workforce. </p>
  <p>3) To achieve this, support for the learner is likely to be provided by a 
  team which may comprise (for example) a curriculum area specialist, a resource 
  centre staff member (or librarian / information specialist), a personal tutor, 
  and a workplace training manager. There is hope that a new, predominantly 
  online, support regime may work better than traditional arrangements, through:</p> 

  <ul>
    <li>One-to-one asynchronous access to the right support <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>for the 
    student the moment questions <span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>through (for example) integrated e-mail. 
    Rather than having to wait for next week's tutorial with the one member of 
    staff who is assigned to him or her, the student can <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>a question at 
    the appropriate person(s) - e.g. curriculum specialist, resource centre 
    staff, or (importantly!) fellow <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> and hope to have a <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>within 
    a <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>or two. 
    <li>Availability of up-to-the-minute information on student progress to the 
    team of tutors, with the automated ability to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in on problem areas - 
    e.g. overdue assignments - enabling tutors to spot any problems as soon as 
    they <span>arise</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> Effective support for individual student tracking (4) was seen 
    as very important. </li></ul>
	
<p>	4) None of this is possible without the right 
  learning materials being available. Generally <span>speaking</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> it will be <span>impossible</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>
  for staff to develop the bulk of the materials for a course themselves. The 
  model has to be sharing and re-use of materials, both within an institution, 
  and between institutions. The learning institution, and its library, should be 
  playing a <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>role of broker of learning objects.</p> 
  
  <p><b>Key to this are:</b> </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Effective and flexible <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>facilities for locating the right 
    materials. (Also, ideally, automatic notification facilities when new 
    relevant materials become available.) 
    <li>The <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>value obtained by cataloguing materials for optimum 
    accessibility. This principle extends to external resources - such as Web 
    pages etc. 
    <li>The <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of materials for re-use. This encompasses both adaptation of 
    materials for new <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and also use of materials in a number of 
    <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> For example, a resource may relate to a number of curriculum areas 
    and also to key skills in number, communication, etc.. 
    <li>The appropriate level of <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>assurance for an institution's 
    materials. </li></ul>
	
  <p>The ability to automatically monitor usage of resources to evaluate their 
  effectiveness and help plan <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>acquisitions is important. </p>
  
  <p>5) Support for <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>(and staff) working from a variety of locations, 
  such as home, the workplace, <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>centres, or open learning centres in 
  the institution. </p>
  <h2>Learning Environment Architecture and Implementation</h2>
  
  <p>To fulfil the requirements for integrated support for the entire learning process, a 
  <span>prototype</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>online Learning Environment was <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and built in a number of 
  phases, with feedback from club members at each stage. The starting point was 
  OLIB(5), an existing commercial library / online resource management system 
  <p>An <b>information model</b> was developed (figure 2), validated with 
  members of the club, and implemented. Because of the methodology and <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>
  toolset used (6), rapid incremental development was possible, with comments 
  from users feeding back quickly into the model and the <span>software</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> In the model, 
  the ovals denote the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span><span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of information <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>(referred to as 
  "domains"). The <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>denote <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>between them.</p> 
  
  <div align="center"><img alt="<span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>2"  height=521 src="bnkfig2.gif" width=525></div>
<div align="center"><br><strong>Figure 2 - Learning Environment Information Mode</strong></div>

  <p>Some significant points are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The curriculum model is split into delivery and assessment strands, 
    following recommended practice in FE (7, 8) enabling greater flexibility in 
    meeting <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> needs. </li>
    <li>The model supports active learning, through "activities" which each 
    student undertakes (individually or in a team), and which are <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>by 
    learning resources. </li>
    <li>The model supports competency based assessment (as well as other forms). 
    The <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>can be broken down into sub-units, sub-sub-units etc., all of 
    which can be marked as <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>as appropriate. This will be when the 
    appropriate evidence (either activities or evidence for Accreditation of 
    Prior Learning) is successfully completed and / or when all the sub-units 
    have been <span>achieved</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> In the current model there is a basic <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of 
    automation of this process of marking chunks of assessment as <span>achieved</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> This 
    could be <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to provide fairly comprehensive automation. </li>
    <li>Each activity may provide evidence for any number of chunks of 
    assessment. For example, a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of patient needs could provide evidence 
    for the achievement of elements in a mandatory Health and <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>Care unit, 
    but also for elements of key skills <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in number and IT. </li>
    <li>When <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>enrol on a programme (standard or individualised), 
    individual "copies" of the programme, delivery modules, assessment <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and 
    activities are automatically made. This means that: </li>
    <ul type=disc>
      <li>the progress of each student is recorded individually </li>
      <li>each student has their own copy of each activity, which they can 
      complete online as appropriate. </li>
      <li>each student's programme and modules can be individually tailored - 
      e.g. providing extra activities to reinforce areas where the student has 
      <span>difficulties</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> or to challenge and extend able <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span></li>
	  </ul>
    <li>Re-use of resources (including activities) across the whole <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the 
    curriculum is <span>supported</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> </li>
	</ul>
	
<p>	<b>The architecture</b> incorporates the  concept of brokerage of learning objects (9) (fig. 3). Libraries and  librarians have always acted as information brokers between learners, 
  information repositories and information providers. There is a current <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to 
  extend this concept (10) to the educational institution as a whole, 
  particularly in the context of electronic information. Rather than being 
  imparters of a <span>fixed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>body of knowledge to a set of <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> learning support 
  staff are being seen as facilitators of learning who responsively <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>
  <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to appropriate learning resources and monitor their progress. </p>
  <p>This brokerage adds value to the information by: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>locating it in the context of an individual student's (or group's) 
    programme of study and progression, using the expertise of the tutor.</li> 
    <li>linking it to assessment and accreditation for each student. </li>
    <li>supporting dialogue with the student to help understanding.</li>
	</ul>

  <p>In the Learning Environment, there are currently two <span>prime</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>routes to 
  resources <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span><span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the institution's boundary, via World Wide Web URLs, 
  or via Z39.50. The latter is an international standard for information 
  exchange between heterogeneous information bases, which allows remote 
  information bases to be queried, and result sets returned in standard format. 
  This capability is being <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in the Learning Environment in two 
  European-funded projects: <span>Renaissance</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and Universe (11). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span><span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>related 
  project, DALI (11), has <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and implemented a charging model for 
  document delivery from remote sites - a <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>component if this kind of

  <p>The <b>User interface</b> for <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> tutors and information managers is

  example, they can be: </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Word-processed <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>- either in read-only or (for activities) in

    <li>Adobe Acrobat <span>documents</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> These allow the embedding of multimedia

    to most <span>modern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>word-processors.) </li>
    <li>Multimedia learning resources - which may have been authored using a 
    variety of packages. </li>
    <li>World Wide Web pages anywhere on the Internet. The same con0erations 
    that apply to any educational use of the Web obviously apply here, and must 
    be addressed in determining an institution's Internet policy. </li>
    <li>Web pages on the institution's internal intranet (some of which may be 
    copies of pages obtained from the global Internet - but <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>locally to save

    lurking out there on the Internet. </li>
    <li>Etc. etc.</li></ul>
	
  <p>In terms of physical location, resources may be <span>held</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> for example: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Within the LE database </li>
    <li>On a local area <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>server (which could be a dedicated document 
    server). This may provide advantages in speed of access, but may <span>limit</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>the 
    visibility of the resources (e.g. to users connected over a local area as

    <li>On the Internet or intranet - referenced in standard Web fashion via a 
    URL (Universal Resource Locator) </li>
    <li>On a <span>CD-ROM</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> distributed to the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>enrolled on a particular 
    programme, and inserted into their own <span>CD-ROM</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>drive. This provides 
    advantages of fast loading for multimedia resources without the expense of 
    high bandwidth <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span><span>connections</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> The obvious disadvantage is the 
    inability to update resources without sending out new copies of the <span>CD-ROM</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> 
    but this may not matter. </li>
    <li>On CD-ROMs mounted on the local <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>on a <span>CD-ROM</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>jukebox.</li></ul>
	
  <p>The <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the mixture of <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to be adopted for mounting 
  resources is one of the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>strategic questions an institution faces in 
  developing online learning. </p>
  <p>The provision for online <b>communication / discussion</b> with tutors and 
  with fellow learners may <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>on learning <span>style</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> educational model, 
  confidence of <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of support required, etc. Examples of a 
  structure would be: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>At the end of each module of delivery - e.g. e-mailing the tutor(s) to 
    comment on the learning which has taken place in the module being the final 
    activity in the module. </li>
    <li>Ad hoc - when problems or inspirations <span>arise</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> Almost certainly, this 
    will be important. </li>
    <li>Once a week (This is traditional but perhaps rarely 
appropriate!)</li></ul>

  <p>Incorporating discussion with fellow learners in the process may be as 
  important as (or more important than!) discussion with tutors.  </p>
  
  <p>The Learning Environment was implemented in a client - server <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> 
  supporting access over local or wide area networks (tcp-ip). An <span>Oracle</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>
  database on the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>server(s) holds the information. The client runs on 
  Windows PCs. In principle, the application could equally run over the World 
  Wide Web, with a web browser providing the client, and (for example) <span>Oracle</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>
  Web Server providing access to the database. Extension to this <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>is 
  under con0eration.  </p>
  <h2>Strategies for Networked Learner Support</h2>
  
<p>  In the Learning Environment 
  Club, there have typically been three overall <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>involved in Learner 
  Support:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>Subject Tutor - the specialist in a curriculum area </li>
    <li>Progression Tutor - the tutor with an overall view of the student's 
    learning needs and progress, who provides counselling around this, etc. </li>
    <li>Information Specialist - also <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to in this paper as "Resource 
    Centre Staff". Providing support around information / resource needs. 
  </li></ul>
  <p>Often, a single <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>fulfils more than one of these <span>roles</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> in part or 
  fully. </p> 
  <p>Each of these are involved in the provision of three types of support: </p> 
  <ul>
    <li>Responsive. Providing information and advice in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> 
    requests for support. </li>
    <li>Proactive. Providing input for <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> either in a scheduled fashion, 
    or as a result of the way a student is progressing (falling behind, showing 
    misunderstanding in assignments, not being stretched, etc.) </li>
    <li>Structural. This is the traditional role of a librarian, but <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>
    into an online context and with more <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>on how resources fit into the 
    curriculum. This covers the management of resources (including delivery 
    modules, assessment <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>etc.) to ensure optimal accessibility. In our 
    case, it also covers the development of new learning programmes; a role 
    which may well be performed by a different <span>person</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> </li></ul>
  <p>The way that individual staff fit into this matrix will differ between 
  institutions. The <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>uses of the learning <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> 
  below will make it clear how these types of support operate. </p> 
  
  <h2>Typical Uses of the Learning Environment</h2>
  
  <p>These are described for the  four <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>types of user shown in <span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>3. </p>
  
  <p><i><b>1) By a Learner</b></i> <br>Tony is enrolled on a modular <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>
  course. He generally works from home - in the evenings or whilst his <span>children</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>
  are at nursery. However, fellow <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>on the course who have no <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>at 
  home work at a number of open learning centres, on or off campus, or at 
  "Electronic Village Halls" near their homes. </p>
  
  <p>Before starting the course, Tony had a number of meetings with tutors to:</p>
   
  <blockquote>- Identify his learning needs. <br>- Decide on his learning 
    goals . <br>- Formulate an <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>plan (12) for his learning, and decide on 
    the programme / modules on which he is going to enrol.</blockquote>
	
  <p>This information is maintained (as word-processed documents) within the 
  learning <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> and can be periodically revisited and reassessed. </p>
  
  <p>In a <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>learning session, Tony may connect in, and initially check his 
  mail, for example picking up a reply from his tutor about a problem he had 
  yesterday, a couple of responses to points he made in group discussion, and a 
  pointer to a resource from a resource centre staff member in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>to a 
  query. He then looks at his learning <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>workspace, where the <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of 
  activities for the module he is currently working on are shown to him (fig. 
  4). He has just finished one activity, and starts on the next, which is marked 
  as current. It may be, for example, a word processed activity sheet, which 
  Tony completes with help from the <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of learning resources attached. These 
  could be, for example, a web page, a multimedia Acrobat document, and an 
  online video. Postits, supplied by the module tutor, and visible just to all 
  the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in this group, explain how each resource might best be used in 
  this context. </p>
  
  <p>In this case, his tutor has <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>an additional learning resource to help 
  him with the <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis of the activity results, which he has been 
  <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>difficult. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>"postit" against the resource explains how to use it. 
  (His tutor found it by a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of the college resource bank <span>held</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>on the 
  Learning Environment.) </p>
  
  <p>When Tony has a problem, he can instantly e-mail his tutor, or others in 
  his support team, such as the resource centre staff. To do this, he clicks on 
  the right mouse button over the activity, which brings up the <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>menu. He 
  selects "e-mail tutor" which brings up his e-mail application, with the "To" 
  box automatically populated with the address of the tutor for this module, and 
  the "About" box populated with the name of the activity. </p>
  
  <p>When the activity is completed, Tony clicks on "Completed" on the <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>
  menu, and the next activity automatically becomes current, whilst this one 
  appears in the tutor's folder of activities for marking. </p>
  
  <p>Tony can also freely research the resource base to explore other items that 
  might be relevant. </p>
  
  <p>In this example, Tony is pursuing a fairly standard college course, 
  although there may be a good <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>between course members in which 
  optional modules they choose. However, learning programmes may equally be 
  totally individual, on a "pick and mix" basis. There are many possible 
  variations between the extremes of standard college courses and total 
  individuality. For example, many colleges give <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>diagnostic <span>tests</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>in 
  key skills when they enrol. These can be presented as activities, marked 
  on-line, and based on the results, supplementary chunks of work can be dropped 
  into the student's programme, to catch up on areas of deficiency. 
  <p>From time to time Tony (and his tutors) will wish to see how he is 
  progressing with the assessment 0e of things, which is visible to both, and 
  is automatically updated as relevant assignments are marked as successful. </p>
  
  <p><i><b>2) By the learning support staff (tutors, resource centre staff 
  etc.)</b></i> </p>
  
  <p>The student's support team monitors progress via </p>
  <blockquote>- <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>communication with the student (and each other) - e.g. 
    via integrated e-mail. <br>- a window onto each student's progress and work 
    in their own workspaces. This may, for example, provide an automatically 
    updated <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of overdue assignments, allowing the tutor to home in 
    immediately on problems as they <span>arise</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> and <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and resolve the problem 
    before the student become disillusioned, drops out etc. </blockquote>
	
<p>	Also, 
  they may locate and add in resources to meet individual student's needs, using 
  the capabilities described in (3) below. </p>
  
  <p><i><b>3) By course designers</b></i> </p>
  <p>Location of appropriate materials, and linking them together to provide 
  structured chunks of curriculum is <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>by:</p> 
  
  <blockquote>- <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>wide <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>types, with access via date, subject 
    headings, full text retrieval, curriculum area, author, etc.. <br>- 
    Cross-referencing and browsing capabilities. <br>- Resource sharing via 
    static and dynamic folders. <br>- Drag and drop authoring and structuring 
    capabilities for developing the catalogue and authoring modules of 
    curriculum. </blockquote>
	
<p>	<i><b>4) By resource / information managers</b></i> </p>
  <p>The management of this information is <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>online by the standard 
  <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>one would expect in a library management system. Authority 
  <span>controlled</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>subject headings, standard <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>schemes, etc. can be used 
  to manage and increase accessibility of information. </p>
  <h2>Key Issues for the future</h2>
  
  <p>These are largely organisational and   cultural rather than technical, for example: </p>
  <p>The sourcing, management and sharing of learning resources. Some things 
  that may help are: </p>
  
  <blockquote>- Arrangements for sharing between institutions. <br>- Third 
    Party Brokers. In many cases, libraries are ideally place to play this role. 
    Another example is the Web Site Unit Exchange project - a QUILT initiative 
    to make available Open College Federation accreditation <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>developed 
    across U.K. colleges (13). <br>- <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>"component architecture" for resources to 
    facilitate their re-use. <br>- <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>clear analysis of the economics of buying 
    in materials versus developing them internally, the investment required and 
    the potential returns. Clearly educational institutions may play the role of 
    resource providers (publishers) as well as consumers, but a clear analysis 
    of how this fits the institution's core <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>is required.</blockquote>
	
<p>	How 
  to "migrate" new <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>and technology into an institution. Some critical 
  success factors may be: </p>
  
  <blockquote>- An effective high-level champion combined with nurturing for 
    staff at the grass-roots. <br>- Catalyst team or staff member, with 
    <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>resources to support their role. <br>- Demonstration of early 
    success in an area that is small enough to be achievable, but significant 
    enough to excite enthusiasm. <br>- Buy-in from key stakeholders. <br>- 
    Perception that it will make participants' jobs better in some way. <br>- 
    Appropriate <span>focus</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> <br>- Defined migration paths from initial small-scale 
    success to later widespread <span>achievements</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> <br>- Defined <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>for 
    <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>feedback and adapting the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy based on successes 
    and problems. <br>- <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span>good fit with the institution's (evolving) culture. 
    <br>- Technology that is <span>reliable</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:72px 24px 72px 24px;position:relative;">.</span> has a good user interface and evokes 
    confidence. <br>- Good provision for staff training. </blockquote>
	
<p>	Forthcoming 
  evaluation of the pilot use of the Learning Environment in colleges will 
  provide further insights. </p>

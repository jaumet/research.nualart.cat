            <h2>Introduction</h3>
			<p>As research and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>increasingly rely on 
            global networks for the creation, <span>storage</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and dissemination of 
            knowledge, the need to educate information-literate <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>has 
            become more widely recognized. Students often <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>the skills 
            necessary to succeed in this rapidly changing <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> and 
            faculty need training and support to make use of new technologies 
            for effective <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning. The current <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
            provides an opportunity for librarians to play a key role in the 
            evolution of an integrated information literacy curriculum, in 
            contrast to past efforts which were sporadic and rarely 
            programmatically based.</p> 
			
            <p>In a 1989 report, the American Library Association states that 
            "Information literacy is a survival skill in the Information Age" 
            (1), and calls for a restructuring of the learning process itself, 
            rather than the curriculum. Revamping the process would ensure that 
            <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
            <ul>
              <li>know when they need information 
              <li>identify what information will address a particular problem 
              <li>find the needed information 
              <li>evaluate the information 
              <li>organize the information 
              <li>use the information effectively in addressing the problem 
            </li></ul>
            <p>There are many challenges <span>inherent</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in changing the learning 
            process, and often the results are mixed. However, since our 
            patrons, collections, and campus <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>span all disciplines, 
            librarians are uniquely situated to create and foster new ways of 
            <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning information technology. According to Fowell 
            and Levy, "Information professionals have the opportunity to take a 
            leading role in developing and delivering the learning support 
            <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>which will be appropriate to this new <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> acting 
            as significant culture change agents in their institutions" (2). 
            Perhaps our greatest challenge is to act on this opportunity, and 
            create the necessary changes. 
            <p>Traditional library instruction programs at U.S. colleges and 
            <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>have <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>some success in changing institutional 
            culture, but this outcome is by no means the norm. Of note is the 
            <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>at Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, which has long had 
            the support of librarians, faculty, and administrators. Efforts 
            elsewhere have not been as successful; programs are often dependent 
            on one or two people, and changes in curriculum and faculty can mean 
            the demise of the <span>program</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> However, this experience in connecting 
            library instruction to appropriate assignments has given librarians 
            a unique <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in approaching uses of technology in <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
            and learning. Rather than using technology for its own sake, 
            librarians have encouraged its use as a tool to facilitate the 
            learning objectives of the course or assignment. As discussed in 
            Chickering and Ehrmann's "Implementing the Seven Principles: 
            Technology as Lever," technology is not <span>neutral</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> so careful choices 
            need to be made to enhance learning outcomes (5). The 1987 study by 
            Chickering and Gamson (6) on pedagogical principles defined good 
            practice in undergraduate <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>as: 
            <ul>
              <li>encouraging contact between faculty and students; 
              <li>developing reciprocity and cooperation among students; 
              <li>using active learning techniques; 
              <li>giving prompt feedback; 
              <li>emphasizing time on task; 
              <li>communicating high expectations; 
              <li>respecting diverse talents and ways of learning </li></ul>
            <p>Thus, technology itself may provide a positive <span>impetus</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>as Rader 
            states, "developments in <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and technology are <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to 
            help academic librarians achieve new breakthroughs in integrating 
            information and technology skills into the curriculum" (3). Other 
            <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>also note that technology is changing the role of 
            librarians, "from the keeper of the books to that of <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
            navigator," (4) and is providing the opportunity for librarians to 
            become more active participants and leaders in the educational 
            process. 
            <h2>The University of Washington: Addressing Information Literacy 
            Needs</h2>
			
			<p>In <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to the challenges of incorporating technology 
            into <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning and the creation of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>at a large 
            public university, the University of Washington (UW) has developed a 
            holistic, campus-wide approach called UWired. The <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>goal of 
            UWired is to create an electronic <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in which communication, 
            collaboration, and information technologies are integral to <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
            and learning; <span>ultimately</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> the aim is for information literacy to be 
            a hallmark of a UW <span>degree</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> In this process of restructuring both 
            pedagogy and paradigm, librarians are active partners in the 
            development and implementation of UWired initiatives, which address 
            faculty development, active student learning, and facilities 
            redesign. Librarians, faculty, computing staff, administrators, and 
            <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>from a number of <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>across campus are collaborating in 
            this project, including Undergraduate Education, <span>Computing</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>&amp; 
            Communications, University Libraries, and University Educational 
            Outreach. UWired seeks to go beyond technology as an end in itself, 
            and <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>offers sustained discipline-specific instruction, useful 
            educational <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of technology, faculty and librarian 
            development, and the requisite facilities and infrastructure.</p> 
			
            <p>UWired is not a new department or administrative construct, but 
            rather a collaborative effort calling on staff from the 
            participating campus departments. In 1994, UWired began as a 
            planning group with a pilot project to enhance the extant Freshman 
            Interest Group <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>with information technology instruction. 
            Informal weekly meetings were attended by a rotating cast which 
            included, at various times, computing professionals, librarians, 
            undergraduate <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>staff, <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> facilities <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>staff, 
            educational assessment staff, and vendor representatives. 
            Responsibility to act was delegated to the planning group and 
            participants brought a willingness to do what was necessary to get 
            the <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>underway, in addition to continuing their regularly 
            assigned responsibilities within their home unit. 
            <p>After the initial pilot project, additional UWired initiatives 
            were launched which required a more formal structure. Steering, 
            Curriculum, Evaluation, and Equipment committees were created, and, 
            in the <span>program</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>s second year, a <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>coordinator was hired. 
            Ultimately, <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>participants have been accountable to a group 
            composed of the heads of each campus unit involved: the Director of 
            Libraries, the Dean of Undergraduate Education, and the Vice 
            Pre0ent for <span>Computing</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and Communications. Since its inception, 
            UWired has been fortunate to have the full support of these and 
            other key University administrators, including the Provost. For the 
            first three years (1994-96), <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>funding came from vendor

            the collaborating <span>units</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> In the budget cycle for the 1997-99

			<p>The Freshman Interest 
            Group (FIG) <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>has been a successful UW initiative since 1987, 
            enrolling several groups of 20-25 new <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in a thematically 
            linked suite of courses that they take together during their first 
            quarter on campus. FIG groups also meet for a one-credit class once 
            each week with a peer instructor to <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>issues surrounding the

            of many of our undergraduates, most of whom are from Washington 
            state. Creating learning communities which ease the transition to 
            college life is one of the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>objectives of the FIG <span>program</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> 
            <p>In the <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of 1994, three of the forty-five FIG groups were 
            selected to be the pilot effort of the UWired <span>program</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> Students in 
            these FIGs enrolled in an additional two-credit technology seminar 
            which was taught by a librarian. During the pilot year, <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> 
            faculty, and librarians were each loaned a laptop <span>computer</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span><b> 
            </b>In each of the following years the FIG <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>has <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to 
            <span>experiment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>with integrating electronic communications and 
            information technology into its curriculum. Due to the need to scale 
            the <span>program</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> laptops were no longer loaned to all participants, but 
            a <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>equipped facility, the "Collaboratory," was constructed. 
            Collaboratory facilities are discussed separately, below. In 1995, 
            eight of sixty FIGs included a UWired component and in 1996 <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
            in all sixty of the FIG groups received a baseline <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to 
            electronic communications and information technology. In order to 
            scale the <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to reach the 1200 <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>participating in the

            the sixty peer instructors, who teach the one-credit course, 
            "General Studies 199: University Resources, Information and 
            Technology."</p> 
			
            <p>The UWired Curriculum Committee, composed of librarians, 
            computing professionals, undergraduate <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>staff, and 
            <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> identified core skills appropriate for introducing 
            <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to campus technology. The committee then developed 
            instructional modules for the three core skill areas: electronic 
            mail, the World Wide Web, and library databases. Educational 
            objectives, instructional materials, and <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>lesson plans were 
            developed for peer advisors to use. Since many of the peer advisors 
            were already <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>with<i> </i>e-mail and the Web, training 
            focused on how to teach these skills and incorporate their use in 
            General Studies 199. Peer advisors participate in an <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
            training <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>prior to <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> and are <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to curricular 
            materials at that time. While the peer advisors introduce e-mail and 
            Web resources, librarians continue to provide instruction on the use 
            of library databases, which usually <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in a <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>course

            <p>Evaluations of the 1994 and 1995 UWired FIGs showed that UWired 
            <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>were much more likely to know about and use campus 
            computing resources than <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in other FIGs. UWired <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
            used e-mail, used it for more academic activities (contacting 
            faculty, contacting other <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>about class projects), and with 
            more comfort, than did non-UWired <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> Students in UWired FIGs 
            used UWIN, the campus information <span>network</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> 45% more often than 
            non-UWired <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> UWired <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>were five times more likely to 
            know how to evaluate World Wide Web information, used the Web twice 
            as <span>frequently</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> were better able to describe specific ways this 
            information would help them, and felt more comfortable using the Web 
            to find information than non-UWired <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> In addition, student 
            comments <span>emphasized</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>how e-mail helped them to feel connected (7). 
            <p>Librarian involvement with the FIG <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>illustrates many of 
            the dramatic role changes brought about by the UWired 
            collaborations. Prior to 1994, librarians would occasionally provide 
            instruction sessions for individual FIG groups, though the process 
            for doing so was inconsistent. As a result of the collaborations 
            fostered by UWired, librarians have contributed to a permanent 
            <span>expansion</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of the FIG curriculum to include a purposeful <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
            to the campus computing <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>as well as a more consistent 
            <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to library resources. The UWired FIG pilot <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
            demonstrated that appropriate uses of technology to achieve clear 
            educational objectives can be extremely effective, and librarians 
            played an active role in defining the uses of technology. In order 
            to expand these <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to other areas of the curriculum, 
            librarians and other staff, in consultations with faculty, have 
            found pedagogical guidelines such as the following to be very 
            helpful. 
            <h2>Intercollegiate Athletics </h2>
			
			<p>In 1995 another pilot project was 
            undertaken to strengthen the academic experience of University 
            athletes. Information and technology training and laptop computers 
            were provided to the coaches and team members of both the men's and 
            women's basketball teams. These two relatively small teams provided 
            a <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>group with gender equity and demanding travel schedules that 
            took the student athletes away from campus during peak academic 
            periods. Students demonstrated they were able to continue working on 
            class projects while away from campus, connect to the campus <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
            to use information resources (library databases, the Web, campus 
            information), remain in e-mail contact with professors and 
            classmates, and turn in assignments through file transfer. The 
            <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>improved their skills in evaluating online sources, using 
            <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>material <span>properly</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> and citing electronic and printed sources. 
            The laptops expanded the academic <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and helped address the severe 
            time constraints under which student athletes operate. While we 
            cannot draw a clear correlation, the women's basketball team 
            <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>a cumulative GPA of over 3.0 for the first time ever, for 
            which the coaches credit UWired. The athletic department included a 
            <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>lab in their redesigned academic center and additional 
            teams received technology training in 1996-97, including<b> 
            </b>baseball, softball, crew, gymnastics, and men's tennis.</p> 
			
            <h2>Upper Division Classes</h2>
			
			<p>Creating information literate 
            graduates means more than working only with freshmen. With this goal 
            in mind, the UWired <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>expanded into content courses <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
            in the winter of 1996. Faculty proposals for upper-division courses 
            which <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>innovative <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to using technology were <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
            through a campus-wide proposal process and were reviewed by the 
            Steering Committee. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>subject-specialist librarian was assigned to 
            each course selected, and technical support and training were also 
            provided to the classroom instructor. Offerings so far include 
            courses in <span>Psychology</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>English</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> Communications, Geography, 
            Environmental Statistics, and <span>Human</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>Biology, among others. 
            Librarians work with faculty to determine their respective <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in 
            these courses and to plan the functions that technology plays in 
            delivering course content.</p>
			 
            <p>Classes may be taught entirely in the Collaboratory or in a 
            <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of lecture hall and hands-on <span>laboratory</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>time. In some 
            cases the librarian provides bibliographic instruction-type sessions 
            using the online resources available in the Collaboratory, while in 
            others the librarian is more of an on-site technical and content 
            resource <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>assisting groups or individuals. Unlike the 
            standardized approach used with the FIGs , the incorporation of 
            technology with the course content <span>differs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>dramatically between the 
            various upper division courses, reflecting the objectives of each 
            course and the nature of the various disciplines. 
            <p>For example, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in the Introduction to Economic Geography 
            course were required to use e-mail, access the syllabus on the World

            groups as the class progressed. One of the best examples of a course 
            in which information technology is integral to <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning

            <p>This course, Czech Dis0ent Literature in a Civil Society, has 
            been taught three times, and each time the use of technology has 
            increased, as has the collaboration between <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> faculty and 
            librarians. In this course, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>read <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span><span>translations</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of 
            the works of Hasek, Kafka, Kundera, Havel, and others, in an attempt 
            to define a national literature for a republic which has for 
            <span>centuries</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>fought to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>a voice for itself.

            Studies and the Slavic Studies librarians were assigned to the 
            course, and met with the classroom instructor several times before 
            the quarter began. The instructor was, by his own account, about one 
            step ahead of his students: the first time he had seriously worked 
            with a <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span><span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>was the month before the class began. UWired 
            was able to expedite putting a connection to the campus <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in 
            his office and provided him with a laptop <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and appropriate 
            training. In the first iteration of the course, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>learned to 
            use e-mail, library resources for literature and East European 
            materials, and had a basic <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to the Web; for senior 
            <span>English</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>majors of 1996, these were skills they may well have left 
            the UW without learning had they not taken this course. The second 
            time this course was taught, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>used the same level of 
            technology, plus had individual meetings with the librarians as they 
            prepared their research reports. 
            <p>In the spring of 1997, the instructor, the <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> and the 
            course have <span>reached</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>a level where the technology complements the 
            content and enhances the learning process. As the course began, 
            nearly everyone enrolled had an e-mail account-a year is a lifetime 
            in terms of technology and the learning <span>curve</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> The first two weeks 
            of the course were devoted to <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>a fairly high technology 
            baseline, with instruction covering topics such as listservs, Web 
            <span>design</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>editors, and the potential uses of the Web for East 
            European research, literary or otherwise. The next few weeks were 
            content-based, with ongoing listserv and classroom <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>about 
            the literature, and library instruction sessions covering literary 
            research sources and methods for locating information on Eastern 
            Europe. These sessions tied in with <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> ongoing projects, and 
            they were comfortable asking either the instructor or a librarian 
            for assistance with the course. 
            <p>Obviously, not all of the upper-division courses taught through 
            the UWired <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>have the same mix of content, technology, and 
            faculty and librarian collaboration. Integrating information 
            literacy into content <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>is much more an individualized process 
            than it is with the standardized FIG sections; however, the concepts 
            remain the same, and provide a variety of models for <span>expansion</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> 
            <h2>Facilities Design</h2>
			
			<p>Computer-equipped <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning 
            <span>spaces</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>are an important facet of the <span>program</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>s success, and 
            librarians have been active in the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of these facilities. For 
            the pilot FIG <span>program</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> a new classroom, the Collaboratory, was 
            constructed in the Undergraduate Library. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>conscious effort was 
            made in the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of this space to avoid the <span>replication</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of a 
            <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>lecture hall where computers are placed in <span>straight</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>rows 
            facing the front of the room. Rather, a non-traditional "podular" 
            arrangement <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>tables located around <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>posts which 
            supply power and ethernet <span>connections</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> In these collaborative 
            <span>spaces</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>can <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>share a workstation or <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>between 
            workstations at the same or another pod. Initially, the 
            Collaboratory was a "plug and play" facility for the laptop 
            computers; however, this space was expanded and 28 workstations 
            installed to support the <span>expansion</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of the FIG <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and the 
            Innovative Courses. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>second Collaboratory houses 60 workstations 
            and is used primarily as an open access lab which can be used for 
            <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>classes. Both facilities are staffed with technical support 
            personnel. In addition to <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>input, one librarian managed each 
            of the construction projects, working with UWired parties 
            (librarians, computing professionals, educational <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>staff), 
            <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>staff, construction crews, and furniture company 
            representatives.</p> 
			
            <h2>Consultants</h2>
			<p>In another effort to bridge the gap between 
            providing computing access and providing instruction in how to use 
            technologies to a particular purpose, librarians are now staffing 
            the Collaboratory which is open to student use when it is not 
            scheduled for <span>classes</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> Students employed by <span>Computing</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>&amp; 
            Communications provide technical support to the lab users, and 
            librarians provide assistance with research queries. This approach 
            has involved librarians from all over the UW Libraries system, 
            increasing the technological expertise and visibility of the 
            librarians. This cross-functional staffing of a computing facility 
            is a further <span>experiment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in relocating the information professional 
            to provide instruction at the point of use, whether that be in the 
            classroom or elsewhere in the student's research process.</p> 
            <h2>Faculty Development</h2>
			
			<p>Faculty training and development is 
            critical to the <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of electronic communications and 
            information technologies into departmental curricula, and a number 
            of training initiatives are underway as a part of the UWired effort.</p> 

            <p>For the initial FIG pilot, a week-long training <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>was 
            <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to the faculty, librarians and peer advisors involved. Since 
            then, a variety of workshops have been <span>offered</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> and are now 
            highlighted in a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>UWired section of the <span>Computing</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>&amp;

            <p>In May of 1996, the Center for Teaching, Learning and Technology 
            was opened which provides consulting, training, and support to 
            faculty who want to retool courses to integrate learning 
            technologies. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>team of consultants, including an instructional 
            <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>specialist, a computing professional, and a librarian, are 
            available to assist faculty with course-related technology projects. 
            In addition to working with specific courses, drop-in workshops on a 
            variety of topics are <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>allowing faculty, librarians, and 
            <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>assistants another avenue to learn technical skills. 
            <p>The UWired Teaching and Technology Lecture Series provides 
            another faculty development opportunity. These sessions cover broad 
            programmatic issues or showcase specific pedagogy techniques, and, 
            like the hands-on workshops, are presented by faculty, librarians, 
            administrators, computing center staff and invited off-campus 
            guests. Previous <span>lectures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>have included these topics, among others: 
            <ul>
              <li>Language Learning, Teaching and Technology 
              <li>The Science Learning Collaboratory 
              <li>New Markets, Old Technology: Telecourses And The University 
              <li>Dodging Potholes in the Information Highway: Appropriate Uses

            <p>Librarians play a vital, and evolving, role in collaborating with 
            faculty to implement the changes necessary for an effective 
            information literacy curriculum. From workshop presentations to 
            one-on-one consultations, faculty see librarians as more than a 
            collections-related resource, and more of a service and 
            training-centered resource. According to D.W. Farmer, barriers that 
            prevent faculty from changing their <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>methods and course 
            content are mostly attitudinal (8); the UWired model has allowed 
            both faculty and librarians to step out of their normal <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and 
            transform their <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>strategies. 
            <h2>Outreach</h2>
			<p>A number of factors, both external and internal, 
            have contributed to UWired's involvement with outreach activities. 
            There is increasing interest among the educational and political 
            leaders in the State of Washington in developing a more seamless 
            K-20 educational <span>network</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> where <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>can <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>smoothly between 
            institutions to achieve their educational goals. UWired has played a 
            part in exploring the role which a research university can play in 
            the K-20 educational <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>within the state of Washington. </p>
            <p>For example, in 1996 the UW sponsored two week-long symposia for 
            <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>college staff to <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>both the infrastructure and 
            pedagogical issues related to technology. The <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>colleges 
            sent teams much along the <span>lines</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of the UWired model: they were 
            composed of a faculty member, a librarian, a computing professional, 
            and an administrator who was involved with infrastructure decisions. 
            In the state of Washington, there is already a strong link between 
            the two-year and four-year institutions of higher <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> as a 
            large number of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>complete two years of undergraduate work in 
            a two-year <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>college, then transfer to a four-year <span>school</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> 
            By way of illustration, admissions data shows that in the <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>
            quarter 1995, 71% of transfer <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>enrolled at the UW had 
            previously attended a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>college elsewhere in the state (9). 
            In sharing the expertise of university faculty and staff with 
            colleagues in the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>colleges, we can explore issues to 
            ensure that the <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>received by <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>who plan to transfer 
            will prepare them to transfer smoothly, complete their <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>in 
            four years, and succeed in a different academic <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> The 
            lifelong learning skills in information and technology play an 
            important role in a student's smooth transition between educational 
            institutions as well as between <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and the workplace. One of 
            several ongoing outreach efforts as a result of the symposia is the 
            invitation <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to a UW librarian by a local <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>college 
            to sit on an advisory panel to <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>curricular <span>integration</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of 
            information and technology skills. 
            <p>Another outreach project involved sponsoring a day-long teacher 
            in-service <span>day</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> More than 350 teachers and librarians from the 
            Seattle Public Schools came to the UW campus to participate in forty 
            different workshops <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>by faculty, computing professionals, 
            librarians, and university staff. Topics for these ranged from 
            hands-on Web training to issue-based sessions on copyright, grant 
            funding, and the impact of technology on <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> to specific 
            <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span><span>applications</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> While there were many contacts between the 
            University and public <span>schools</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>before this in-service <span>day</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> the event 
            stimulated increased interest in and awareness of these 
            possibilities and a coordinator has been hired to facilitate these 
            endeavors. In addition, there is an ongoing conversation between 
            public <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and university librarians which had not previously 
            existed. 
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>UWired continues to be a valuable opportunity for 
            librarians to create new professional <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>and to collaborate with 
            groups from across the university in a networked educational 
            <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> As partners in the educational process, we are 
            increasingly perceived as highly trained technical and content 
            experts available to administrators, faculty, and <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> In many 
            ways our experience illustrates the principles described by Fowell 
            and Levy, who note "the emergence of a para-academic role for the 
            subject/information librarian, entailing greater involvement in 
            facilitation of, and support for, resource-based open learning . . . 
            as the librarians play a far more active role in the support of 
            <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> learning and course development." (10) This experience has 
            been both invigorating and empowering as we have realized, and 
            demonstrated, our effectiveness as instructional resources.</p> 
            <p>Librarians' <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>are not the only ones that have changed with 
            the formation of UWired; the <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>of our users and colleagues, 
            including faculty, <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> and staff from around the University 
            have changed as well. Students in UWired <span>classes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>are much more 
            active participants in the <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>process, and they, too, have 
            proven themselves to be instructional resources as they work with 
            each other, their instructors, and librarians. As noted, faculty are 
            overcoming some of the barriers to change as their comfort with 
            technology and their collaborative efforts increase. For librarians, 
            these changes have led to increased communication, improved services 
            and the cooperative leveraging of resources. Our work with designing 
            and implementing curriculum-based information literacy instruction 
            has, <span>ultimately</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span> redefined our role as <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:81px 27px 81px 27px;position:relative;">.</span>to the mission of the 
            University.

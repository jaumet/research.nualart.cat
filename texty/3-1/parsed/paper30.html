  <h2>The European context for networked learner support</h2>
  
  <p>The strategic importance of the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>profession in encouraging and helping to 
  disseminate new information technologies within the European Union (1) is 
  demonstrably recognised by the high profile it has assigned to educational 
  telematics in its funding priorities. The European Union recognises the 
  potential of educators to influence and <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>information technology 
  within curricula and ensure its wide dissemination (2), with the consequent 
  need for skills <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>amongst the educational <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> The Telematics 
  for Teacher Training (T3) project (3), based at the University of Exeter’s 
  School of Education, is one of several collaborating international consortia 
  (4, 5) which aim to introduce educational technology into the <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
  practice of several thousand teacher educators and <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>across European 
  partner states. Partners in the project include the University of Oulu, 
  Finland; Universitat Utrecht, the Netherlands; the University of Minho, 
  Portugal; the Istituto per le Tecnologie Didattiche, Italy; and the Institut 
  Universitaire de la Formation des Maitres of Grenoble, France. Within 
  Directorate General XIII’s Telematics Applications Programme (6), the 
  Education and Training Sector includes projects like T3 as Support Actions 
  whose results are generally applicable across a broad <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of disciplines. 
  For the <span>future</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> the European Union’s envisaged <span>Fifth</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>Framework Programme has 
  <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>the theme of a generic, multidisciplinary role for information 
  technology, so <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to the enhance the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of life in a global 
  information society as envisaged by Bangemann in his 1993 report (7).</p>
  
  <p>The application of educational technology to the needs of remote learners 
  in widely distributed communities was first <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>by the European Union 
  in its Third Framework DELTA programme covering Telematics for Flexible and 
  Distance Learning, which early on identified the benefits of lifelong learning 
  and confirmed the <span>utility</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of distant technologies for efficient <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and 
  training dissemination. The mainly technical issues addressed in the Third 
  Framework developed on in the current Fourth Framework Programme (1994-1998) 
  to concentrate on enhancements to the networked information infrastructure for 
  European citizens. Under the Telematics for Libraries Programme (8), special 
  <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>is paid to the ‘the demonstration of <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>interconnections 
  between libraries and with the European <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>infrastructure ... to create 
  an array of networked library services’, with ‘library-mediated services for 
  end-user access to <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>information resources’. The European Union thus 
  acknowledges the continuing need for librarians to act as mediators for 
  electronic information access in the global information marketplace as a 
  natural <span>extension</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of the role they have historically performed with more 
  traditional print-based media. In recent Fourth Framework Libraries projects 
  such as EDUCATE (9), BIBDEL (10), LISTED and BORGES, planning and delivery of 
  enhanced information services to networked learners both site based and at a 
  distance have demonstrated the powerful <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of telematics for 
  <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and training.</p>
  
  <h2>The T3 library work package</h2>
  
<p>  The Telematics for Teacher Training 
  project is unusual amongst its wholly educational fellows in that it includes 
  as one of its work packages (WP08) provision for course development for 
  librarians supporting teacher educators in its European partner institutions. 
  It has thus built into its remit a cross-sectoral link with the Telematics for 
  Libraries Programme that specifically recognises the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>role of 
  librarians in user <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> the potential for enhancement of their 
  contribution when made in partnership with their <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>community, and their 
  own opportunities for professional development in acquiring and passing on new 
  skills. In the current climate in transition in <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>from <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to 
  learning, the concept of networked learner support that is <span>founded</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>on 
  addressing the needs of its users is here tightly focussed on a particular 
  target group which is reflected in the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and build of a tailored on-line 
  resource (11). Moreover, the content and format of the resource must <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
  to a multi-tiered clientele which includes institutional librarians, educators 
  and their own <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> The issues involved in meeting the requirements of 
  this diverse user group also extend far beyond those of one faculty, 
  institution or <span>region</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> and are <span>ultimately</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>constrained by the complex mix of 
  political and technological <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>exercised in each of the host countries 
  within which the T3 parners re0e.</p>
  <p>University of Exeter Library input to work package 08 began in April 1996 
  and will be <span>achieved</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>by the end of March 1998. In that time there will have 
  been completed two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>deliverables to the European Union : a preliminary 
  user needs analysis in report form and on the Internet via the WorldWideWeb 
  (WWW) (12), and a Web-based online course for European library staff 
  supporting teacher trainers. The research began in May 1996 with a 
  questionnaire circulated to <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>librarians in the six T3 partner 
  institutions requesting <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>on various aspects of their technology access 
  and user <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>programmes. Conclusions <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>from the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>were 
  channeled into recommendations for course development within a collaborative 
  <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>which is now actively underway. These and similar data gathered on a 
  European wide scale have been invaluable to inform and assist other research 
  currently underway in the Libraries sector of the Telematics Applications 
  Programme, and also overlap most usefully with individual countries’ training 
  initiatives such as the Electronic Libraries (eLib) Programme in the United 
  Kingdom. Whilst not subject to the additional political and technical 
  complexities <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>by working within the infrastructures of several 
  countries, the core number of eLib projects researching into different areas 
  of networked learner support also encounter a wide <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>in progress 
  towards fully networked resources and services between different institutions 
  and even departments within the same institution.</p>
  <p>As a European <span>hybrid</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>project with cross-sectoral interests between the 
  Libraries and Education and Training Programmes, the T3 library work package 
  is distinctive in its particular orientation which seeks to integrate:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the European dimension; 
    <li>pedogogic theory and practice; 
    <li>electronic technology and subject resources to cater for the information 
    needs of a specific target group; 
    <li>recognition of the continuing training needs of educators and librarians 
    as trainers themselves. </li></ul>
	
  <h2>Preliminary user needs analysis</h2>
  
 <p> The nature of networked information 
  services and <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>accessed by librarians and educators in higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
  institutions widely distributed across Europe was characterised by a 
  preliminary needs analysis conducted amongst the project partners. General 
  levels of provision, access, availability and usage levels were sampled, 
  quantified and integrated to yield a common approach to resource development 
  of maximum <span>utility</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and relevance to the participating institutions. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
  questionnaire <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>was <span>devised</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to determine a foundation position by asking 
  what? how? who? where? questions covering:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>subject based resources in a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of electronic and hard copy formats 
    <li>institutional and external <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>availability 
    <li>user profile, with specific <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to teachers, teacher trainers and 
    trainees 
    <li>usage levels 
    <li>training initiatives 
    <li>training facilities 
    <li>future institutional plans for development 
    <li>other programmes underway countrywide. </li></ul>
	
	<p>Responses to the <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
  amongst partner libraries provided an overview of current policies and 
  <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>in teacher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>across Europe, insights into how representative 
  partners’ experiences are of general developments within the country 
  concerned, and pointers as to how identifiable trends and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>might be 
  <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to influence <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>directions in due course. The resulting report,

  <p>Survey <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>broadly devolved into three areas under <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>which 
  <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of the networked learner support initiatives underway at 
  each of the partner institution libraries : political, technological and 
  training. In political terms, it is the <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>government philosophy in each 
  of the European countries surveyed that determines the level of national 
  funding available : to upgrade the telecommunications infrastructure, develop 
  information networks into its <span>regions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and provide incentives to higher 
  <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>institutions to promote the use of educational technology. It was 
  apparent that the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of available technology for course delivery varies 
  substantially between countries and institutions, but each partner library is 
  generally well resourced by <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>with other academic and research 
  organisations in its home country. It should also be emphasised that the fast 
  paced <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of and demand for wider access to national information services 
  access has already changed the European wide picture con0erably in just 
  under a year. Partner countries who during the data gathering phase may have 
  <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>less <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>than others now appear to have ‘leapfrogged’ several 
  stages forward, replacing an uneven patchwork of local or regional networks 
  with a much more unified country wide approach. The <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>now paid within 
  the European Union to the strategic importance and potential benefits of 
  information and communications technologies to all its citizens, in social and 
  economic as well as educational terms, is here reflected in recent 
  implementation as in policy.</p>
  
  <p>Technological issues embraced a number of levels, <span>extending</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>from national 
  networks and supporting infrastructure through to local area networks within 
  an individual institution. The potential for uneven development is multiplied 
  severalfold when applied across a <span>spectrum</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of partner countries. <span>Nevertheless</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
  networked learner support services and electronic information access are well 
  <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>throughout all libraries surveyed, often integrated into the 
  curriculum as subject and skills instruction. Networked and standalone 
  CD-ROMs, access to electronic library catalogues and information resources, 
  electronic mail and availability of WorldWideWeb interfaces to the Internet 
  are everywhere present. The use of educational technologies such as ISDN 
  videoconferencing, well <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>within the academic <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> was usually 
  accessible within the teacher training institutions surveyed although not 
  <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>at a location convenient to the library itself. Future indications 
  for technical resource provision were generally positive despite the local 
  variations in budget administration, although enhanced <span>equipment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>spend was not 
  a guarantee of a learning programme in <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>skills to match.</p>
  <p>Questions relating to the user profile of the partner libraries were 
  coupled with those on active programmes of information skills training for 
  users, their frequency and location. The heterogeneous <span>composition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of the user 
  group included all levels of training needs, from incoming student teachers 
  through to teacher trainers and in some cases the educational <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>beyond 
  the host institution. This broad constituency <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>resulted in training 
  programmes at induction, skills updating and continuing professional 
  development levels, ranging in frequency from occasional to <span>regular</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> 
  Continuing training was con0ered most revealing in its insights <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>into 
  the partners’ information <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and their <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>implementation. The 
  management, resourcing and location of user instruction again varied between 
  institutions but usually devolved between the computing unit and the library. 
  Despite the wide availability of networked learner support and instructional 
  programmes in information skills, there was noted amongst the teacher 
  <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>community in particular a certain reluctance to become <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>with 
  information and communications technologies that mirrored the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of 
  United Kingdom Electronic Libraries research in projects such as TAPin.</p> 
  <p>The report summarised its data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>in a number of recommendations 
  that called for enhanced collaboration and ‘networking’ within and amongst the 
  T3 partners and their libraries to raise the profile of networked learning to 
  their users. Closer liaison with staff, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and departments and 
  encouragement of feedback would help to build <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>upon which <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>training 
  could be developed or adapted from existing programmes and resources. Beyond 
  the institutions themselves contact was encouraged with other related 
  electronic library research programmes in the host countries as well as across 
  the European Union, for <span>mutual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>identification and reinforcement of current 
  initiatives. The need for cooperation with academic departments of 
  librarianship and national and international information professionals’ 
  organisation was emphasised, to ensure the course’s relevance and validity to 
  librarians at all stages of development.</p>
  <p>Before its release and as required by the European Union for funded 
  projects, the user needs analysis report was finally the subject of a peer 
  review process in which evaluation and critique were invited from two 
  information professionals, based in the United Kingdom and Finland 
  <span>respectively</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> Comments received from both emphasised the survey’s relevance to 
  its European wide remit and the professional development needs of librarians 
  supporting teacher trainers. Shared opportunities for closer liaison between 
  academics and librarians through the <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of networked learner support were 
  highlighted as worthy of promotion, particularly in enhancing the professional 
  standing of librarians working in a higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>setting which is again 
  reflected in the United Kingdom in the work of the EduLib programme. The need 
  for <span>rigorous</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>academic evaluation criteria of the online course once developed 
  would be required to ensure its fitness for purpose and responsiveness to the 
  needs of educators as well as librarians. The issue of possible eventual 
  validation for the course was also addressed.</p> 
  <h2>Resource <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and development</h2>
  
 <p> Web and paper based information 
  emanating from a number of electronic library projects, professional and 
  educational resources, and discussion lists within the United Kingdom and 
  worldwide were monitored during the succeeding months to confirm for inclusion 
  those issues con0ered most critical by educators as well as the information 
  profession. Some specifically address the <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of transfer of such 
  ‘traditional’ librarians’ skills as subject <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
  enquiry into the electronic <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> whilst others <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>more with 
  challenges presented by the intangible nature of online information in 
  intellectual property ownership and <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>control. Many recurring themes 
  were noted, not least of which is the global acknowledgment within and beyond 
  the profession of the changing <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>for librarians as educators and 
  information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>advisors in a rapidly evolving and uncertain electronic

  educational technology <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and techniques con0ered of most interest to 
  student teachers and teacher trainers. Areas of common interest were 
  identified amongst a number of European Union Telematics Applications projects 
  in the Education and Training and Libraries sectors as well as within United 
  Kingdom Electronic Libraries programmes, and contacts made where appropriate 
  to ensure development in <span>parallel</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
  
  <p>Its overwhelming popularity, versatility and rapid development led to the 
  <span>selection</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of the Web as the <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>on which the library course is being 
  structured. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>watching eye is also kept on the progress of the less widely 
  distributed videoconferencing and ISDN technologies whose use is nevertheless 
  becoming more common in European teacher <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> as well as more recent 
  innovations such as <span>hybrid</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>computer conferencing and Web technologies. The 
  particular <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of the resource has demanded in its <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>a unique blend of

  access; electronic library skills and resource management; information skills 
  for educators and educational resources; library professional development 
  initiatives, organisations and resources; and coverage of recent developments 
  in other technologies available for delivery of networked learner support. 
  Selection of elements for inclusion drew from the European and generic 
  technology issues identified in the user needs analysis <span>survey</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>rapidly

  subject specialism.</p>
   
  <p>The course displays the benefits of the most current thinking in

  The evident wide <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>infrastructure, connectivity and 
  reliability across the partner libraries resulted in an initial decision to 
  minimise such <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>options as large graphics, animations and sound files. It 
  was envisaged that a high proportion of users would be accessing the resource 
  from remote sites that might only benefit from a dial up modem link and an 
  older version Web browser, and that <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>too time consuming to load would 
  impair functionality, possibly add on cost and <span>prove</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>a disincentive to 
  structured use. Similarly, at an early stage in the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>process it was 
  thought advisable to include tuition in older <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>protocols such as 
  archie, gopher and telnet for those users who were not able to access 
  graphical browsers. These choices were later overtaken by project feedback and 
  the rapid pace of technological development in partner institutions.</p>

  Telematics for Teacher Training project are involved with online course and

  Academics involved in subject resource development in electronic discussion

  on his own library Web pages providing networked learner support in Portugal, 
  including interactivity, virtual tours, animations, frames and demonstrations. 
  He confirmed the need for incorporation of exercises in such areas as basic 
  searching skills and also discounted the necessity of acknowledging earlier 
  <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>access routes as now outdated and redundant. When other partner

Project wide <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
  implementation is still at an early stage, mainly due to discrepancies amongst 
  partner institutions in bandwidth, skills base, and availability of resources 
  and dedicated staff.</p>
  <p>The uniformly rapid <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>amongst European partner librarians to the

  work package. Again not unique to our own library research, channels for 
  intra-institutional communications have perhaps turned out to be less <span>reliable</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
  than those between the partners themselves. Where there has been no strong

  of project resources to aid networking between libraries has sometimes 
  remained <span>unknown</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>general invitation to a librarians’ workshop as part of

  encountered similar cultural issues within the partner institutions as other 
  networked learner support programmes, in terms of the need to raise the 
  profile of, and priority assigned to, information skills training initiatives 
  as examples of <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>implementation of a partner’s information strategy. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
  certain amount may also be inferred with caution regarding the importance 
  attached to professional development within a host institution. Other areas 
  where obstacles to library collaboration have arisen is in language used, as

  <h2>Academic partnership for professional development</h2>
  
<p>  By addressing the 
  training needs of librarians serving educators, the T3 course for librarians 
  is building <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>between the professions that combines pedagogic models with 
  two tiers of networked learner support. Informed by the latest theories 
  regarding <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>strategies and <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to learning, <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>awareness 
  and effective course <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and delivery, the academics and researchers on the 
  T3 team <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>a wide ranging European outlook and expertise in <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> 
  Coupled with their <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>experience with the <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of 
  information and communications technologies to <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> all work packages 
  benefit from this translation of theoretical pedagogy into electronic learning 
  resources. The Web site and courses under development carry a distinctive 
  project look and feel and are increasingly the subject of joint team efforts 
  to integrate models with <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>technological <span>features</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> These are 
  supplemented by the use of electronic mail to deliver course tuition, feedback 
  and support to distant <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> which also forms an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>tool for team 
  collaboration both on an individual and group discussion <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>basis, project 
  wide and targeted to subject area. Interactive, real time <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
  conferencing is <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to be piloted, whilst videoconferencing has now 
  become fully <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>within T3 as a communications <span>medium</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>for team members 
  across all work packages, enabling <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>sharing, file exchange, 
  materials evaluation and <span>mutual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>Internet use. Finally, the innovative virtual 
  workshop programme continues to do much to promote team involvement and 
  identification, exchange of moderated pedagogical discussion, and new 
  technology demonstration.</p>
  <p>The emerging context of the electronic library and global information 
  superhighway has brought many attendant changes to the skills and expectations 
  of library and information workers. The <span>universal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span><span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>for the profession 
  is that the needs of information staff for their own continuing professional 
  development not be <span>lost</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>in the shuffle of all those other users who <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
  our services in networked learner support. It is necessary for the information 
  profession across all sectors to grasp a unique opportunity to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>
  ourselves centrally and firmly in the information <span>revolution</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>with an enhanced 
  recognition of all our skills including <span>teaching</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> too long overlooked without 
  an agreed <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>for encouragement such as is <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>by the Staff and 
  Educational <span>Development</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>Association (SEDA) in this country. In the United 
  Kingdom this awareness often manifests in <span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of ‘convergence’ between 
  information and computing professionals under combined <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>known as learning 
  resources centres, whereas in the wider Europe such <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span><span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>converge 
  in a single member of library staff. In both Europe and the United States the 
  position of the librarian as tutor and facilitator of user <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>is widely 
  recognised in job designation amongst higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>institutions, although 
  formal training programmes may not be well <span>advanced</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> Whilst individual 
  departments may support the concept of professional development in theory, 
  reallocation of resources to permit librarians’ own training as a priority 
  activity may be more problematical in practice, especially in the current 
  constrained climate where increasingly only validated courses are con0ered 
  viable for staff release. <span>Development</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>of institution wide programmes of 
  networked learner support should facilitate the establishment of a local 
  training culture in which the needs of all user groups, including information 
  staff, are integrated and adequately resourced.</p> 
  
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  
 <p> The T3 library work package is rare amongst networked 
  learner support initiatives within Europe to include in its remit professional 
  development for librarians as well as other educational end users, and hopes 
  that by so doing it will have helped to raise the profile of librarians as 
  full academic partners in their respective communities. By designing the 
  course in collaboration with other European librarians to encourage local 
  ‘ownership’ and adaptation where desired, and introducing the course for 
  librarians initially in T3 partners before disseminating it more widely into 
  pilot sites, we hope to generate <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>feedback before full release to 
  ensure relevance for purpose and evident <span>utility</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>across institutions, 
  countries and sectors. The user needs analysis drew <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>to the need to 
  build <span>links</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>with European library organisations, training <span>bodies</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span>and interest 
  groups to guarantee the course remained in touch with professional <span>concerns</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span> 
  echoed in the peer review which unreservedly recommended the broadest possible 
  liaison.<br>To combine educational ‘best practice’ with resource development 
  for information professionals confirms the academic role of librarians in 
  networked learner support. It provides a two way exchange of educational and 
  information expertise that fosters communication in equal partnership, with 
  the potential for cascading information skills development via both educators 
  and librarians to an ever wider European user <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:75px 25px 75px 25px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

  <h3>1.0 Introduction </h3>
  
  <p>Integrating on-line technologies such as CMC and the 
  World Wide Web (WWW), into both campus and distance learning courses is 
  becoming more of an issue. On-line environments can facilitate learning. 
  Indeed [1] suggests that one ‘obvious pedagogical advantage over the normal 
  face to face tutorial is that students can take time to ponder the various 
  points made and can make their contribution in their own time’. However 
  questions are being asked about how we can best support such teaching and 
  learning and what aspects of this process work well when compared to face to 
  face teaching? Projects which have investigated these issues have therefore 
  become of increasing interest to educationalists both inside and outside the 
  Open University. STILE ('Students' and Teachers' Integrated Learning 
  Environment') is one project which involved four universities in the United 
  Kingdom. The on-line facilities were provided in both campus and distance 
  learning situations. Our partners investigated the on campus model, (see [2], 
  [3], [4] and [5]). The system used was based on the World Wide Web (WWW). 
  However the Web did not suitably facilitate conferencing in 1995, for our 
  distance learning students. Therefore we at the Open University also adopted a 
  proprietary conferencing system.</p>
  
  <p>The course selected for the project at the Open University was M205 
  Fundamentals of Computing, hence the project was called M205 - STILE. This 
  course had been running for ten years and all of the tutors had experience of 
  teaching this course in a face to face situation. The introduction of M205 - 
  STILE necessitated on-line working. The tutorial groups involved in the 
  project included both students taking the on-line part of the presentation and 
  students taking the traditional version of the course. This enabled us to 
  probe the tutors about their feelings on what was different in on-line 
  teaching when compared with face to face teaching. It has been suggested by 
  [6], [7] and [8] that the introduction of a conferencing environment increases 
  a tutors workload and a students perception of overload. The alleviation of 
  this problem in our environment necessitated the introduction of a new role to 
  support the tutors and students on-line interactions. This independent role 
  was that of an Interactive Media Facilitator or IMF. This role was described 
  as 'definitely innovative', by [8] who said 'with hindsight, it is easy to 
  point to numerous examples of the need for such a role in the Open University 
  context'. This paper will also discuss the part played by the IMF, and the 
  tutors perceptions of this role.</p>
  
  <p>One of the main aims of the Open University implementation of the project 
  (M205-STILE) was to improve the presentation of the course by enabling 
  structured access to on-line course material while also providing a variety of 
  channels of communication not only between tutor and student, but among 
  students themselves. The nine tutors and one hundred and ten computer science 
  students involved were situated Nation-wide and in Europe. They were on-line 
  for the duration of their course which lasted for nine months, from February 
  to October, 1995. The facilities provided included the Netscape browser 
  version 1 revision N (copyright 1994, Netscape Communications Corporation) 
  with Trumpet version 2 revision B (Copyright 1993, 1994, Peter R. Tatum &amp; 
  Trumpet Software International Pty Ltd). The conferencing system we adopted 
  was FirstClass version 2.6 (copyright 1994, Softarc Inc.).</p>
   
  <p>To support the additional facilities of the Web and conferencing on this 
  course presentation, we adopted the role of the IMF. In the CMC context, the 
  IMF designed, constructed and facilitated a conferencing environment which 
  encouraged students to participate in all three of the following dimensions. 
  These were:<br>a. a knowledge dimension, enabling students to learn about the 
  computer science course.<br>b. a social dimension, enabling them to 
  communicate with each other to find possible “help mates”.<br>c. and a 
  motivational dimension, where the conference was structured to enable students 
  to get quick feedback and even to shadow other students activities.</p>
  
  <p>This paper evaluates some of the support structures which were devised to 
  facilitate on-line learning. Firstly the role of the IMF and secondly 
  participation in the three dimensions mentioned above.</p>
   
  <h3>2.0 Results</h3>
  
  <p>This paper presents a range of empirical findings which 
  will address the following issues.</p>
  
  <p>1. A comparison between face to face and on-line teaching; the tutor’s 
  perspective, <br>3. The IMF’s role from the tutors perspective and <br>4. The 
  tutors suggestions about how conferencing should be integrated into future 
  courses.</p>
  
  <p>These issues were assessed through two on-line questionnaires which were 
  completed after the tutors "on-line experiences". The same types of questions 
  were asked in different ways to encourage the tutors to think more deeply 
  about these issues.</p>
  
  <h4>2.1 A comparison between face to face and on-line teaching; the tutor’s 
  perspective</h4>
  
  <p>As far as possible every student in the nine tutorial groups 
  based in both remote and rural areas was offered the opportunity by the IMF to 
  take part in the on-line presentation of the course. A number of the students 
  could not participate for a variety of reasons, for example not owning the 
  correct equipment, (for more information see [9]). Each tutorial group 
  therefore involved a mixture of students, some who could take part in the 
  on-line course and some who could not. This enabled us to send questionnaires 
  to eight tutors which were aimed at a comparison between face to face and 
  on-line teaching. We received a 100% response rate. Most tutors thought that 
  M205 - STILE did not affect attendance at their face to face tutorials. In 
  fact six of the eight tutors reported that attendance at face to face 
  tutorials was similar to other years while two tutors reported that attendance 
  was better than usual. They felt that M205 - STILE had not affected attendance 
  to a greater or lesser extent. Six of the tutors reported that students who 
  were unable to attend face to face tutorials were able to use M205 - STILE to 
  download notes from the session which <i>were helpful</i> and the students 
  <i>had the psychological boost of not feeling</i> they <i>had missed out 
  entirely</i>. The tutors were asked how the other students in their tutorial 
  group not involved in the on-line project had reacted. These students showed a 
  certain amount of interest, a few were envious when various aspects of the 
  on-line project were described. Some of the tutors tried <i>to minimise their 
  feeling of being left out</i>. A few students not involved in the project 
  reported <i>that they would not have been able to cope with the extra 
  technology on top of everything else</i>.</p>
  <p>The following tutor responses are as a result of being asked if they 
  presented tutorial material any differently in M205 - STILE than at a face to 
  face tutorial. Although the eight tutors agreed that their use of FirstClass 
  did not impinge on their normal face to face tutorial. It did however change 
  their style of presentation. Four tutors reported a consensus that they had 
  presented 'tutorial type' information differently in M205 - STILE than at 
  their face to face tutorial session. As they were using a new medium they were 
  not quite sure about how to adapt the material they used at face to face 
  sessions. One tutor felt that she had to bear in mind in her face to face 
  session that she would also be presenting the material on-line. She reflected 
  more on the material before she presented it. She said it <i>made me think 
  more carefully about the structure of the tutorial, as notes were put into the 
  conference</i>. Also another tutor said,<i> if answering questions is 
  considered tutorial type information, then I don't think there is too much 
  difference, except that in STILE the answer will be more thorough because you 
  are not sure just how much the student needs and will tend to give more than 
  is perhaps necessary, to be on the safe side</i>. The above and following 
  responses indicate the different expectations tutors had, both in advance and 
  when they used the on-line system. This shows that it is not always possible 
  to anticipate appropriate uses of a new medium. However only three of the 
  tutors felt that they <i>did not really use STILE to present tutorial type 
  information</i> except the resources which were prepared in advance of the 
  course start date. The tutors were actually learning on the job because in 
  retrospect they wished they had presented tutorial type information on-line 
  but reported that they were not sufficiently prepared for this type of 
  approach. One of these tutors felt that <i>the information would have to be 
  presented differently in that it would have to be a lot more structured than a 
  face to face tutorial, which I tend to play by ear, relying on input from the 
  students as to how long to spend on any topic</i>. This suggests that it is 
  difficult to know how long to spend on a topic on-line because of the lack of 
  feedback provided in this environment. There is also a much greater need 
  on-line for anticipation and listening skills to inform the process of 
  teaching and learning. It is difficult to make a strong case from this data 
  and more in-depth interviews need to take place to understand exactly what the 
  tutors are saying. </p>
  <p>The tutors were also asked three more questions which were interspersed 
  with other queries at different points in two questionnaires. Through these 
  questions we wanted to ascertain the tutors perception of both their face to 
  face and on-line teaching:</p>
  <p>1. How they compared their face to face tutorial with their use of 
  M205-STILE?<br>2. What were the advantages and disadvantages of their 
  interactions at face to face tutorials as compared to M205 - STILE?<br>3. What 
  were the benefits and the downside of M205 - STILE to teaching and learning?
  <p>One tutor felt that <i>face to face, in general is better but it's a close 
  run thing</i> when compared with electronic teaching. Three of the tutors 
  referred to the student being enabled to describe their problem in a 
  conference message at the time that it occurred and even if a response was not 
  forth coming for a few days from the tutor it was a more considered response. 
  For example one tutor said that the on-line system meant that <i>one can 
  present fully prepared answers to queries rather than off the cuff responses 
  which one hopes are correct</i>. Another tutor echoed this point and suggested 
  that one way to perhaps overcome the lack of immediacy in a CMC environment 
  would be to use the synchronous chat facility. Three of the tutors felt the 
  conferencing was complimentary to the face to face and telephone teaching on 
  the course. One tutor felt that it could be equally as good as face to face 
  teaching saying <i>I believe in the same way that tutorials provide 
  supplementary teaching by providing an alternative way of looking at things 
  and highlighting particular difficult areas, then STILE can and did the 
  same</i>. The tutors in effect utilised the strengths of each system to guide 
  their own teaching. </p>
  <h4>2.1.1 The advantages in face to face teaching</h4>
  <p>When the eight tutors 
  were asked about the good points in face to face tutoring, six of them 
  referred to the immediacy of response in the face to face situation when they 
  could see quickly what was troubling a student. In the face to face situation 
  they could easily diagnose the problem and give appropriate feedback. If a 
  response was not clear, one question could quickly be followed by another, 
  enabling the facilitation of responsive problem solving. Language and gestures 
  gave important feedback to the tutors. For example one tutor said <i>F to F 
  allows me to see who understands and who doesn't, also different levels of 
  understanding, I can change my approach immediately in F to F and respond to 
  body language, include reticent students and insure participation by work in 
  groups</i>. Another tutor echoed the later point saying that <i>students don't 
  know what they don't know and therefore don't know what questions to ask. The 
  look on a student's face or the tone of the voice is often a good indication 
  as to whether more explanation is required</i>. She also saw the advantage of 
  face to face tutorials as allowing students to work <i>in co-operation with 
  each other, and raise...problems/questions</i>. If a group was struggling, she 
  could <i>give one or two hints and leave them to discuss it some more. Then 
  the whole group can collaborate on and discuss the solution</i>. The tutors 
  perception was that the students needed to meet face to face <i>to see and 
  talk to other students and to experience the give and take of a live tutorial. 
  Students get a lot out of meeting other students face to face, and in forming 
  a good relationship with a tutor, voice and body language are important in any 
  relationship!</i> Face to face tutorials enabled the students to work through 
  sample problems prepared in advance. Academic discussion could occur with a 
  presentation of argument in the ‘live‘ situation. One tutor reported that face 
  to face tutoring tended to be <i>on a more general level</i> with past Tutor 
  Marked Assignments (TMA)’s used to illustrate points, and it was easier to 
  encourage interaction at face to face tutorials. One tutor described<i> 
  interaction at a f2f as more about keeping attention and ensuring 
  understanding</i>. Not having used the medium before the tutors did not know 
  how to compensate in the on-line environment for the usual clues they received 
  about a students understanding. They were not sure if the answer they had 
  given was appropriate, understood or what affect this had on the students 
  perception of the original problem. This has implications for the motivational 
  dimension, since a student may feel misunderstood or more seriously feel they 
  are not up to the course and could become demotivated and give up. However 
  some tutors highlighted the advantage of conferencing enabling a student to 
  ask a question they would have felt less confident to ask at a face to face 
  tutorial, see section 2.1.2.</p> 
  <h4>2.1.2 The advantages in on-line teaching</h4>
  
  <p>M205 - STILE worked well for 
  the provision of extra on-line teaching materials and tutorial notes for those 
  who could not attend the face to face session. For example one tutor said 
  <i>students who can't make F to F can still receive tutorial support, but not 
  immediately</i>. The tutors stress that in the on-line environment it was not 
  possible to give an off the cuff response, and therefore the quality of the 
  response to the student was better. However the downside to a more considered 
  reply was the length of time required to make such a response. Another tutor 
  mentioned that <i>all the students managed to download the notes I’ve 
  produced, which has helped in face to face tutorials</i>. This suggests that 
  the environment was good for encouraging the students to prepare in advance of 
  a face to face tutorial. The on-line environment was good for answering 
  specific questions raised by students. Students could raise problems at a time 
  that suited them for example in the middle of the night <i>if the problem was 
  not urgent.. they... could leave problems for me to pick up in the next day or 
  two</i>. One of the tutors expectations was that the students would initiate 
  requests for help rather than they themselves being proactive about known 
  problem areas on the course. This tutor also commented that perhaps the 
  students <i>felt they did not need more help than they could get by 
  'lurking</i>'. The on-line environment provided the students with <i>more 
  access to tutorial help</i> because, they could send messages in M205 -STILE 
  if they could not contact their tutor by telephone. On-line messages were<i> 
  very useful for discussing long fragments of code</i>. The on-line environment 
  was particularly suited to discussing program code which was very important 
  because the alternative was to use the telephone or Royal mail which often 
  proved difficult mediums for this subject domain. One tutor felt that, <i>in 
  an electronic tutorial, no student needs to feel disadvantaged</i> because 
  they could ask questions that they would be afraid to ask in a face to face 
  session because they <i>feel stupid</i>. The benefits in the on-line 
  environment when grouped into our three dimensions are seen as: </p>
  <p><b>Knowledge</b> 
  <ul>
    <li>the sharing of experience... knowledge and expertise, 
    <li>useful for students who can't attend face to face tutorials, 
    <li>information on such things as errata can quickly and easily be sent to 
    everyone, </li></ul>
  <p><b>Social</b> 
  <ul>
    <li>a combination of being part of a community as against being solitary, 
    <li>the opportunity of a quick fix, 
    <li>facilitates contact between students for self help purposes, </li></ul>
  <p><b>Motivational</b> 
  <ul>
    <li>the feeling of using a modern medium, 
    <li>a particular question need only be answered once since the question and 
    the answer are available to everyone, (<b>particularly motivational for the 
    tutors</b>), 
    <li>useful for students who would rather work alone with just some 
    re-assurance and support </li></ul>
  <p><b>The down side was seen as:</b> 
  <ul>
    <li>the need to get familiar with the software, 
    <li>finding the time to use the system, 
    <li>contact seems impersonal no matter how many smiley icons are used or how 
    much care is taken with how things are phrased. 
    <li>harder to encourage .. interaction than at a f2f tutorial </li></ul>
	
  <h4>2.2 The IMF’s role from the tutors perspective </h4>
  
<p>  In the past tutor work 
  overload with conferencing has been reported at the Open University by [8]. 
  The role of the IMF was created therefore to design a dynamic framework in 
  which the IMF took overall responsibility for the environment and acted as a 
  buffer between the students and the tutors to reduce work overload for the 
  tutors. In effect this ensured a work focus and allowed the tutors the freedom 
  to attend to the students in their own tutorial conference and to 'dip into' 
  and contribute to other conferences as and when they wished. The intention was 
  to also increase the students knowledge dimension through social interaction 
  and sustain students motivation throughout the duration of their computer 
  science course. The IMF maintained the momentum by responding quickly and 
  effectively to students needs.</p> 
  <p>We asked eight tutors in a questionnaire how helpful it was to have the IMF 
  taking overall responsibility for the on-line environment. All eight tutors 
  stated that the role was essential, one mentioned, especially so, 
  <i>considering the steep learning curve being negotiated by staff and students 
  alike</i>. Another tutor echoed this point saying <i>I knew nothing about the 
  system to start with, and it took a while to get to grips with it</i>. The 
  tutors remarked that the IMF responded to needs and controlled access rights 
  to the various conferences. For example one said, <i>in any case, how would 
  everyone have the correct access to the relevant conferences if there was not 
  one person in overall charge?</i> The tutors saw the IMF’s role as a must. 
  <i>Someone to pick up the pieces</i> and guide their students in their 
  absence. One of the tutors described some of the essential characteristics of 
  the IMF as being <i>helpful, hard working, and patient with the tutors who 
  were to busy too always respond on time</i>. </p>
  <p>The tutors were asked how they would improve on the M205 - STILE model ie 
  having the IMF, separate tutorials, a free for all Help conference and course 
  material on-line. Three tutors felt that the balance was about right, <i>I 
  think the STILE model is fine for supplementing existing teaching</i>. Two 
  tutors mentioned the need for critical mass in all areas to encourage 
  interaction. Other points raised were the need :</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><i>to make the whole involvement integral to the course and award marks, 

    <li>a means of getting more participation by the students, 
    <li>all course documentation such as stop press’ ... should be on-line, 
    <li>initial help in getting started with the software,</i> </li></ul>
  <p>The tutors were asked if the IMF’s setup of M205 - STILE (with the course 
  team monitoring the M205 Help conference) affected their perceived workload. 
  They were also asked if they ever felt overloaded with messages, (see also 
  [10]). Five of the tutors reported that the structure controlled by the IMF 
  helped a lot, and reduced their perceived workload. One tutor whose tutorial 
  group was quieter said <i>in fact I looked into the Help conference quite 
  often and intervened when I thought I might be able to make a swift 
  contribution</i>. While the tutor with the busiest tutorial group said<i> it 
  was a great relief knowing that I didn’t have to respond to every problem. The 
  temptation is to leave things to others</i>. Seven of the eight tutors who 
  responded said that they did not feel overloaded with messages. One tutor 
  remarked <i>sometimes...the overload was not in the number of messages but in 
  some that needed extra time such as non-working program code</i>. 
  <h3>2.3 The tutors suggestions about how conferencing should be integrated 
  into future courses. </h3>With respect to future courses the tutors were 
  asked, after using conferencing, how they would see it incorporated in future 
  courses. They suggested that conferencing <i>could be equally applied to any 
  course</i> in the future in the following ways:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><i>for areas where face to face tutorials are difficult, 
    <li>for communication between tutors, between tutors and students and 
    between students, 
    <li>for information, advice and self-help, 
    <li>for submission of assignments, 
    <li>as a supplement to face to face tutorials,</i> </li></ul>
	
  <p>They mentioned however that it was essential to have <i>a critical mass</i> 
  of students, and <i>vital to make it an integral part of the course... 
  actually award marks for students doing work as part of the conference</i>. 
  Their comments about conferencing being used in the future as a supplement to 
  face to face tutorials could be influenced by the fact that this was their 
  first use of conferencing when they were not totally confident with the 
  medium. This attitude to conferencing could change with time due to not only, 
  perceived pedagogical benefits but more courses being involved in this type of 
  distance education. We would like to monitor any change in on-line as against 
  face to face teaching. The importance of conferencing for remote groups was 
  highlighted especially as it was the only contact these students had apart 
  from the telephone. </p>
  <p>One tutor felt <i>that the students actually gained a fair amount out of 
  the system even if it was only as observers rather than active participators 
  in many cases. I do feel very strongly that my students did not utilise me 
  enough</i>. He suggested a way forward were a <i>tutor could send a student a 
  Pascal program with some errors in it. The student would need to download 
  this, correct the program and send it back to the tutor who would award an 
  appropriate number of marks.... I believe that I would approach things 
  differently at the start in a subsequent presentation and endeavor to 'force' 
  the students to be involved in a dialogue. In reality it may require the award 
  of marks as part of a TMA say to motivate the students into a genuine two way 
  communication. Perhaps the students involved in this type of presentation 
  could be given some slightly different TMA questions which were assessed by 
  the tutors partly on the basis of work and communication made using First 
  Class?... I would also make use of the system to put all my tutorial material 
  in folders for all my students to download. Apart from saving me a lot of time 
  and effort in photocopying it would also mean that those students who could 
  not come to tutorials could obtain the material.</i> </p>
  <h3>3.0 Conclusions</h3>
<p>  We found that the tutors had a variety of different 
  expectations of the on-line system and that success of the on-line interaction 
  depended not only on the system itself but also on the tutors ability to teach 
  in this very different cultural arena. One tutor commented that <i>whilst it 
  seems natural for a tutor to adapt earlier successful tutorial strategies to 
  the conference regime, this for me did not seem to work. Making the students 
  engage with conferencing thus does not seem the same as making them engage 
  with a f2f tutorial. </i></p>
  <p>Despite the advantages to on-line teaching some tutors believed in the need 
  for face to face teaching. One tutor remarked <i>conferencing is a big step 
  forward in distance learning and definitely has a place in student support, 
  but from my experience, most students need a prop, the tutor, and that tutor 
  needs to be seen!... I feel students still need to be offered face to face 
  support as distance learning involves more than just delivering facts over the 
  network</i>. Another tutor mentioned that <i>the students need to see more 
  positive advantage (or compulsion?) to get them started.</i></p> 
  <p>The tutors valued the IMF’s role in the on-line environment. Indeed [11] 
  discussed the importance of human mediators to the acceptance of new 
  technologies. They describe the mediators 'as individuals who intervene 
  deliberately and with organisational authorisation in the ongoing use of CSCW 
  technology within its context of use'. They 'support ongoing changes to the 
  technology and context over time'. By responding to users feedback they could 
  change the organisational environment. They need to have 'credibility with the 
  users' and be 'sensitive to' their needs. The IMF was able to carry out this 
  function in a number of ways: </p>
  <p>1. By making the extra on-line material available in a staged approach ie 
  making the material for each block of study available at the relevant time. 
  <br>2. By responding to student feedback and allowing read only access to all 
  tutorials.<br>3. By being available and approachable.<br>4. By being 
  technically skilled and familiar with FirstClass and so able to use a subset 
  of the Administrators tools to design and improve the M205 - STILE environment 
  throughout the course presentation.</p>
  <p>It has also been suggested by [11] 'that because such mediators directly 
  influence users' interactions with their technology, they can have a profound 
  effect on how usable, appropriate, and relevant the technology is (and 
  remains) in particular contexts of use'. They suggest that the 'action of 
  mediators may play a critical role in helping CSCW applications </p>. 
  <h3>4.0 Future work</h3>
  
  <p>In the on-line environment tutors reflect on student 
  queries and give a more considered response but they are not able to easily 
  ascertain if their response to a student query has been appropriate or not. 
  For the future both the tutors and researchers should be concerned with 
  finding techniques to compensate for the lack of visual and verbal cues that 
  accompany electronic communication and thus facilitate more clues as to the 
  students levels of understanding with this type of teaching and learning. The 
  dialogue scenarios taking place need further investigation to ascertain what 
  would be suitable compensatory measures for this lack of feedback. We also 
  need to ask what can be added to, or work in conjunction with, asynchronous 
  text based conferencing to encourage more interaction between tutor and 
  student at the knowledge level. Perhaps this could be achieved through 
  developing ways of giving on-line feedback through the introduction of 
  synchronous on-line chat sessions or the introduction of tasks to be carried 
  out in a given time frame. The tasks could require the students to interact 
  with their tutor at various stages and the incentive to participate could be 
  an allocation of marks for the whole activity. The role of the social and 
  motivational dimensions for sustaining this important learning experience, 
  cannot be ignored and need further exploration. Finally a comparison between 
  on-line and face to face conferencing would not be complete without the 
  students input. Therefore we intend to follow up the issues raised here in an 
  analysis of student questionnaires were we asked them to compare computer 
  conferencing with face to face tutorials. </p>

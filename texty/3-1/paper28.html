  <br>
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  
  <p>The University of Birmingham became involved with the 
  Training and Awareness Programme in Networks (TAPin) Project in 1995. The 
  project, funded through the HEFCE Electronic Libraries programme(1), aims to</p> 
  
  <blockquote>"establish models for the effective transfer of skills in 
    utilising networked resources"(2) </blockquote>
	
<p>	It aims to change the 
  Information Technology culture within the academic community by strengthening 
  internal support roles for both librarians and academic staff. From this 
  position of shared knowledge and combined strengths, TAPin will deliver 
  effective and carefully targeted training and support by </p>
  
  <blockquote>"... enhancing the expertise of academic staff in the 
    appropriate exploitation of networked information resources" (3) 
  </blockquote>
  
<p>  As the expertise of academic staff member increase, this will 
  have a positive effect on the IT culture of the institution. Further, if the 
  expertise is to be maintained, internal support needs to take account of the 
  technologies under scrutiny. Full details of the TAPin project have been 
  reported elsewhere(4). This paper focuses on the implementation of the TAPin 
  Model at the University of Birmingham and addresses some of the issues 
  surrounding support for the technologies. One of the strengths of TAPin was 
  its "focused, local and practical" approach to developing and adapting methods 
  of support for the effective transfer of skills. The focus on local 
  implementation allowed the TAPin team at Birmingham to develop mechanisms of 
  support and training (online and others) which could take account of local 
  circumstances.</p> 
  
<p>The recent development of networked technology into the educational 
  environment has prompted a re-examination of the support for, and support of, 
  training. Subject librarians have always played a key role in providing this 
  support and training for information retrieval. This traditional role can 
  perhaps best be seen as re-active. With the increase in IT, subject librarians 
  are able to become more pro-active using the networked technology available. 
  This key role builds on, and extends, the approach endorsed by Follet(5) and 
  Fielden(6). By taking a leading role in supporting emerging technologies, 
  subject librarians act as significant cultural change agents in the 
  educational environment they are part off.</p>
   
<p>In adopting the TAPin model to the local environment, it became apparent 
  that Networked Learner Support(7) is an integral feature of this approach. The 
  Support mechanisms formed a hybrid approach using both new and existing 
  technologies. In order to understand the support mechanisms provided, it is 
  necessary to provide some detail about the institution of the University of 
  Birmingham and the local environment in which it operates.</p> 
  
  <h3>The University of Birmingham</h3>
  
<p>  The University of Birmingham was founded 
  by a Royal Charter granted in 1900. There are 32 Schools which are divided 
  into 7 Faculties. It has over 15000 full time students and over 1300 staff. 
  Networked services form part of the remit for Information Services.</p>
   
  <h3>Information Services at the University of Birmingham</h3>
  
  <p>Information 
  Services at the University was established in October 1995 in order to 
  "integrate the planning, management and delivery of academic information 
  services to support the teaching, learning and research on campus"(8). The 
  convergence into Information Services of the University Library, Academic 
  Computing, Television and Film Services, together with the Centre for Computer 
  Based Learning strengthened the provision of Information Services on campus 
  and saw networked access to the new technologies put high on the agenda. The 
  libraries of Information Services comprise 10 libraries with the Main Library 
  and the Education site Library housing the education stock.</p> 
  
  <p>Following the convergence a new Learning and Research Support Division was 
  established. The Division brings together staff from a range of information, 
  computing and media backgrounds and skills to "deliver support for teaching, 
  learning and research"(9). The division is organised into four discipline 
  based teams including Commerce and Social Science, Education and Law. LRS is 
  positioned to support both open and resource based modes of study using IT and 
  networked information resources. This local power base of combined skills and 
  shared knowledge of networked resources was in its infancy when the University 
  joined the TAPin project.</p> 
  
  <p>The Information and Computing Systems Division manages and develops the 
  University's network and other central and distributed computing facilities. A 
  modern High Speed Campus Network (HSCN) network management station was 
  recently installed to facilitate networked access on campus and this network 
  (HSCN) is connected to the academic network, SuperJANET. Although there is no 
  agreed ongoing HSCN investment strategy to ensure the continued use of the 
  infrastructure, a draft strategy is in progress.</p>
  
  <p>The reorganised management and service structures allows Information 
  Services to be responsive (and hence pro-active) to the changing academic 
  shape of the University. The infrastructure helps to promote networked support 
  and ensured a good reception for the TAPin Project.</p>
   
  <h3>The TAPin project at the University of Birmingham</h3>
  
<p>  The University of 
  Birmingham participated in two of the four subject areas targeted for the 
  TAPin project - Education and Life Sciences. For the purposes of this paper, 
  the approach adopted is described for implementation within the Education 
  subject area. All the librarians involved in TAPin at the University 
  contributed to the development of the model and helped pull together the 
  networked learner support delivery mechanisms.</p>
   
  <h3>The School of Education</h3>
  
 <p> The Education subject area at the University 
  of Birmingham forms part of the School of Education in the Faculty of 
  Education and Continuing Studies. The School offers research degrees, initial 
  teacher education and professional development of teachers and others engaged 
  in education.</p> 
  
  <h3>Research Base</h3>
  
  <p>The School has, over two assessment periods, achieved 
  and sustained 5A standing in the RAE (10). It attracts a large number of 
  externally funded research projects and regards itself as firmly in the top 
  three national centres for education research. The strong research base in the 
  School confirmed for the TAPin Trainer (the term used throughout to describe 
  the role of the subject librarian at the University of Birmingham) the 
  importance of support for TAPin members (the term used throughout to describe 
  the academic staff members from the School of Education) if the networked 
  resources were to be exploited to maintain the RAE grade.</p>
   
  <h3>Equipment standards</h3>
  
  <p>For historical and cultural reasons, the School of 
  Education supports both PC (c89) and Macintosh (c32) machines although not 
  always to the same level. (MAC machines were originally bought by the Distance 
  Education unit when they were a self financing department). This lack of 
  standardisation causes some concern over the level of support. There are also 
  indications that MAC software running on machines is falling behind the PC 
  equivalents. Equivalent software is not necessarily loaded onto every machine 
  within the department. Software is often loaded onto staff machines on request 
  rather than as a matter of course by the IT support Officer in Education. The 
  TAPin Trainer had to work closely with the Computer Officer to ensure 
  appropriate software was loaded. Issues of cross platform support pushed the 
  potential delivery mechanism towards the Internet.</p>
   
  <p>The prevalence of MAC machines made network support even more difficult as 
  the TAPin Trainer had to overcome a steep learning curve with MAC machines 
  before training and the support could be offered.</p>
   
  <p>The TAPin Annual Report had advised TAPin Trainers to target staff who had 
  Internet access and a 486 or pentium processor desktop computer. However, this 
  was not possible or practical in the School of Education with this large 
  number of MAC machines and whose users made up a large percentage of the TAPin 
  sample.</p> 
  
  <h3>Access to the Library Information Network</h3>
  
 <p> Access to a major networked 
  resource available at the University, the Library Information network is not 
  available using a MAC machine. The Library Information Network provides access 
  to around 60 cd-roms and other networked databases but cannot be accessed from 
  the desktops of 35% of academic staff in the School of Education. The scale of 
  need, coupled with the diverse nature of hardware and software available 
  within the School, placed a high demand on the networked support which could 
  be provided.</p>
   
  <h3>The Local Approach by the University of Birmingham</h3>
  
  <p>The local approach 
  to the implementation of the TAPin model has two parts. First, TAPin trainers 
  set about establishing the who, where and what could be developed in the 
  model. Second, the issue of how training would take place and the networked 
  support which could be provided were examined. The first issue will be dealt 
  with briefly followed by a more in depth examination of how the training was 
  provided and supported.</p>
   
  <h3>The Sample</h3>
  
  <p>A sample of staff members (20%) within the School of 
  Education at the University, who had taken part in the Initial Questionnaire 
  Survey were identified to take part in the second stage. Staff members who 
  expressed a desire to be trained and those who were generally keen to learn 
  were targeted. All the targeted staff were research active. The model focused 
  on supporting the research activities of TAPin members and bringing them up to 
  speed on network skills. This reinforced the strong research base of the 
  School. Supporting the technology for teaching was not addressed.</p>
   
  <p>A Training schedule was produced to take place on a flexible, informal 
  basis, being held within their own offices, and inviting non-threatening and 
  supportive training. This targeted approach would produce a "core of 
  champions" for networked learning who would, in turn, cascade and transfer 
  networked learning and support throughout the School.</p>
   
  <h3>Networked Learner Support </h3>
  
  <p>The Training Programme devised covered a 
  range of electronic and printed information sources and can be found in 
  Appendix A. The "Mix and Match" approach was felt essential given the wide 
  range of IT skills, held by TAPin members &amp; identified by the TAPin 
  questionnaires. As a result, several training methods and different levels of 
  support were identified. Only those using the networked technologies will be 
  described here under five headings</p>
   
  <blockquote>a) Orientation around Information Services 
    <p>b) Training and support for networked Online and CD-ROM resources 
    <p>c) Training and support for the Internet as a research tool 
    <p>d) Training and support for other IT applications 
    <p>e) Networked learner support for communication</p></blockquote>
	
  <h4>a) Orientation around Information Services</h4>
  
 <p> The recent transfer of the 
  old electronic library guide to the new, updated Web Library Guide(11) 
  coincided with the launch of the TAPin project at the University of 
  Birmingham. The web library guide is a hypertext guide which gives guidance to 
  users on the subjects and services available in the Main Library. Research 
  material held in the Main Library complements the focused collections built up 
  in the Education Library.</p> 
  
  <p>This mechanism of delivery support affords the user the ability to improve 
  his or her library skills on an individual basis from the network. The guide 
  is being developed to link to a web study skills project.</p> 

  <h4>b) Training and support for networked Online and CD-ROM 
  resources</h4>
  
 <h5>Work booklets on the Web(12)</h5>
  
  <p>The first area of 
  support to be developed using online mechanisms was that of publications. 
  Publications are perhaps one of the largest assets Information Services has. 
  The Publications budget within Information Services is around twenty thousand 
  pounds and covers a range of guides and leaflets.</p>
   
  <p>It was felt that publications were a suitable support tool to mount on the 
  web. This gave publications a certain "added value". It also allows MAC and PC 
  users the opportunity to view them because of the cross platform nature of the 
  Internet. Further, it ensured that materials were available "on demand", 
  providing users the opportunity to approach their learning in an incremental 
  way. This "time shift" element was seen as important for TAPin members, 
  allowing users to work at their own pace at a time convenient to them.</p>
   
  <p>However, the established programme has over 100 publications and so it was 
  not possible, nor deemed appropriate, to load them all. The work had to be 
  prioritised. A suite of work booklets, covering a range of networked 
  resources, were produced. The Internet "work booklet" lent itself to be 
  initially launched on the web page, because the worked examples could become 
  live links. An example of the work booklet can be viewed in Figure 1. (The 
  irony of a web guide being on the web was not lost). The booklet described 
  examples using Netscape browser.</p> 
  
  <center>
  <h4>Figure 1</h4><a 
  href="../mulfig1.gif" height="567" 
  width="800"><img alt="Figure 1" height=200 src="mulfig11.gif" 
  width=320> </a></center>
  
  <p>The Internet guide was produced using "front page" software and then loaded 
  onto the TAPin Web Page by the Web master. The advantage of loading the guide 
  in HTML format is that it provides user to ability to browse. Also, the pages 
  can be indexed by search engines and gateways. There are plans to mount the 
  work booklets in a portable document format so that they can be printed out to 
  look like their original paper format.</p>
   
  <p>Other work booklets in the suite were loaded but, initially, only as plain 
  text files. This was partly because the services described in the work 
  booklets were not available on the web. Once the booklets were launched on the 
  web (even as plain text) the services described were transferred into the web 
  environment! Support was being offered on a basic level but none the less was 
  there. The work booklets enabled TAPin members to work at their own pace and 
  to refer back to a particular resource.</p> 
  
  <h5>Production and maintenance costs</h5> 
  
  <p>Mounting the Guides put the information into the public domain, and shifted 
  the printing costs, to some extent, to the School, and away from the 
  Information Services already heavily committed publications budget. Production 
  and maintenance costs of the work booklets (in print and on the web) was 
  expensive. It took around 40 person hours to produce and mount the guides. 
  Revision was necessary as soon as the guides went live. (The TALIS Library 
  catalogue and the BIDS service are now available on the Web!). Also, the TAPin 
  assistant has had to spend time checking that the booklet links are still 
  active. These costs, together with the time needed to learn new software such 
  as Front Page, were borne by the TAPin project investment.</p>
   
  <p>Not all TAPin members welcomed this move away from supplying hard copy of 
  publications (although in fact printed copies were still available). Printing 
  in the School was not always easy and not all TAPin members had access to 
  their own printers. This was compounded by the fact that several TAPin members 
  worked from home and preferred to make hard copies. Concern was also expressed 
  distance education students (c800) may not be able to take advantage of this 
  support because they did not have access to appropriate equipment. Although 
  online delivery means wider dissemination, this support was not always 
  welcomed.</p>
   
<h5>  User Guides loaded onto the Library Information Network</h5>
   
  <p>The Library information Network is networked across campus to PC based 
  machines, and provides access to over 60 cd-rom and floppy diskettes 
  databases. To help TAPin members utilise the research potential of the LIN the 
  in-house guides have been made available under the &lt;F1&gt; function keys on 
  the Main Menu as plain text files on the Main Library CD Server. Distribution 
  of the guides in this format ensures that when staff and students access the 
  LIN in the Library or at their desk top, they are able to obtain immediate 
  support for the specific database being searched.</p> 
  
  <p>As with printed guides, web guides need to be kept current and accurate. 
  Re-writing the guides, although time consuming, is relatively cheap. Few 
  printing costs are involved. The three key database guides to the education 
  area have also been loaded onto the web on the TAPin pages to alert users to 
  their existence. This is particularly important for the MAC users who do not 
  have direct access to the LIN. Networked support is also provided by the 
  Information and Computing Systems division(13).</p> 
  
  <h4>c) Training and support for the Internet as a research tool</h4>
  
 <p> Training 
  TAPin members to exploit the Internet for research fell into two areas. 
  Members who had little or no knowledge of what the Internet was or members who 
  had difficulty locating appropriate information. Complete novices were guided 
  to the work booklets outlined above to begin their training. Following that, 
  online support was offered through a current awareness service and a 
  elementary gateway.</p> 
  
<h5>  Individual Current Awareness for TAPin members on the web(14)</h5>
   
  <p>Setting up a current awareness service is difficult, and no more so than on 
  the web. TAPin members supplied five key terms to represent their research 
  interests. The key to an effective Current Awareness Service is ensuring that 
  the service is tailored. Obtaining keywords which adequately describe TAPin 
  members interests was more difficult than expected. Several members did not 
  want to commit themselves to only five specific keywords, whilst others 
  offered very broad topics (ie. education, management) without much concern 
  that this would generate too many resoruces. Information on the opening 
  Current Awareness screen prompts TAPin members to advise if the key words they 
  have supplied need to be updated.</p>
   
  <p>The key terms supplied were then used to search a number of gateways and 
  search engines to locate useful resources. The resources were then evaluated 
  for relevance and annotated by the TAPin trainer. They were then added to the 
  TAPin members page on the web.</p> 
  
  <p>To provide a sense of individuality, password control was added. This 
  entailed TAPin members to enter a password into their own Home page. There has 
  received mixed reactions. Some felt it was yet another "thing" to remember 
  when you are searching whilst others felt it provided them with a sense of 
  privacy to what is, in effect, perhaps their own work. The networked support 
  mechanism was able to inform the research base of the School for TAPin 
  members.</p> 
  
  <p>Most searching is conducted once a month, although if resources are located 
  at other times and fit the criteria they are mounted immediately. Using the 
  web as a support tool ensures that the resources identified are current 
  (although this is not always easy to establish). Further, it extends the range 
  of services which can be identified for the TAPin member such as ftp sites or 
  other software.</p> 
  
  <p>Throughout the duration of the TAPin project, the Research team at TAPin 
  have supplied details of key educational resources they have located using the 
  electronic mail system and the Internet. This helped in the initial stages 
  once details of the TAPin members interests were provided. Electronic mail was 
  also used by TAPin partners to disseminate information on new resources which 
  could be added to this service. 
  <p>The current awareness service adds value to networked support provided and 
  alerts TAPin members to available networked resources. Support by Information 
  Services for a current awareness service is a new development and its 
  effectiveness yet to be realised.</p> 
  
<h5> Elementary Education Gateway(15)</h5>
  
  <p>During preparation for the TAPin members Training Programme it became 
  obvious that there is no one single (or obvious) gateway to educational 
  resources. TAPin members are directed towards SOSIG and/or specific Home Pages 
  of other Schools of Education although little was available on the Information 
  Services Home Page and the School of Education have yet to launch their own 
  home page.
   
  <p>The TAPin Trainer set about devising an elementary gateway to educational 
  resources using SOSIG(16) as a model. The Gateway was arranged in broad 
  subject areas corresponding to the four management areas of the School of 
  Education and which were represented by the TAPin members. Resources were 
  located using the same methods as the current awareness service, that is, by 
  searching within a profile of key terms appropriate gateways and search 
  engines. The resources were evaluated using criteria based on relevance, 
  authority of the material and comparability with related sources. The 
  resources were then added to the web page with annotations. The opening page 
  is shown in Figure 2

  <p>The gateway seeks to inform staff of new sites, subject guides, search 
  engines, discussion lists, FAQ archives, databases and teaching materials 
  which have been mounted on the Internet. For the duration of the Project, the 
  resources are mounted on the TAPin web pages at the University. At present 
  this resource is not searchable. 
  
  <p>The TAPin web pages are complemented by the new Information Services 
  Guide(17) which replaces the Library Home Page. The IS Guide is beginning to 
  provide, amongst other things, a FAQ on reference services. The development of 
  the FAQ offers a simple but effective means of dealing with large volumes of 
  related resource enquiries (see Electronic Enquiry Service). The IS Guide 
  provides support across the divisions of Information Services for all staff 
  and students at the University. There is a link to the main Education 
  Resources on the IS guide from the TAPin pages. Duplication of effort is 
  avoided by the same individual being responsible for the two educational 
  resources on the IS Guide &amp; TAPin.</p>
   
<h5>  Skills level</h5>
  
  <p>Providing and maintaining the Education Gateway to resources draws upon the 
  TAPin Trainer's subject and technical expertise. This technical expertise was 
  helped by the TAPin project. The Interim Report for TAPin (18) found that 
  librarians were wanting in a number of key areas of networked skills, 
  including loading items onto the Internet. This skills gap had to be addressed 
  before networked support could be offered. TAPin provided a comprehensive 
  training programme receiving contributions from other Elib projects such as 
  Netskills and Edulib (19, 20). This training programme enabled the networked 
  support to be better managed. At the University of Birmingham, professional 
  development of LRS staff is achieved by attendance on courses organised by the 
  Staff Development Unit or other internal training session, many of which are 
  organised through an Awareness Seminars programme. The training for TAPin 
  Trainers and that provided by the University is provided at a cost to both the 
  University (in releasing the TAPin Trainer) and to TAPin. In offering support 
  account needs to be taken of the skills levels of the subject librarians 
  involved.</p> 
  
  <h4>d) Training and support for other IT applications</h4>
  
  <p>Networked Learner 
  Support in sections a) to c) can perhaps best be seen as an extension of the 
  subject librarians traditional role of offering training and support on 
  printed information resources. Developments in IT and the convergence of 
  Information Services has extended the support to cover more generic IT 
  applications. This support is aided by inclusion in the converged Information 
  Services of the Centre for Computer Based Learning. Open Learning offers the 
  potential for enhancing learning for all. Although the Open Learning Menu was 
  not developed for TAPin, the TAPin trainer was able to call upon its support 
  to help more technophobic TAPin members to improve their IT skills.</p>
   
<h5> Open Learning Menu</h5>
   
  <p>Information Services has developed an Open Learning System recently 
  launched and added to the Library Information Network. The Menu provides 
  networked support to a range of computer based learning and computer assisted 
  learning packages which includes both in house material and commercially 
  produced packages. The Menu offers access to other IT applications including 
  study skills, a student assessment facility and computer assisted language 
  learning courseware for international students. This type of networked support 
  enables self paced learning over the network. Open Learning ensures that the 
  process of learning encourages greater proficiency in the use of computing and 
  IT skills.</p> 
  <p>For other areas of IT applications not presently on the Open Learning Menu, 
  or elsewhere, networked learner support was limited. TAPin members are 
  directed to commercial organisations who may provide demonstration discs of 
  the application in question.</p> 
  
  <h4>e) Networked Learner support for communication </h4>
  
  <p>The Networked Learner 
  Support outlined in the implementation of TAPin at Birmingham has described 
  support for specific applications and services to TAPin members. Networked 
  Learner Support goes beyond this. The existing technologies can help 
  facilitate communication between the information professional and academic 
  staff. Communication and support were key elements in the successful 
  implementation of the TAPin model. Email was already in place and is well 
  established within Information Services and across the University. All TAPin 
  members had access, and were users of, electronic mail. The strength it brings 
  to the communication process is implicitly accepted.</p> 
  
<h5>  Electronic Enquiry Service</h5>
  
  <p>The immediacy of support that electronic mail brings was recognised by the 
  TAPin team. TAPin members were encouraged to email the TAPin Trainer with any 
  enquiry they may have to build up an electronic enquiry service. The number of 
  messages increased over time. The TAPin Trainer was able to receive and 
  respond to general enquiries about the networked technology. As the number of 
  messages increase, the TAPin Trainer is using the information to build up a 
  Frequently Asked Questions database for members of the School of Education. 
  This way the information received can be turned into a "knowledge garden" for 
  networked learner support.</p>
   
  <p>The existing infrastructure at the University enables the Electronic 
  Enquiry Service to be effective because Information Services manages all 
  aspects of networking on campus and thus informs the process of support. This 
  infrastructure has also enabled the TAPin Trainer to receive networked support 
  from "experts" within Information services by re-directing electronic mail 
  messages as required.</p>
   
  <h5>Current Awareness Service by electronic mail</h5>
  
  <p>The Individual tailored pages for TAPin members are complemented by an 
  electronic Current Awareness Service utilising the electronic mail system. In 
  consultation with colleagues in the Collection Development Division, a Current 
  Awareness Service is to be offered to TAPin members for help with the 
  selection of new books for their research. Use is made of the Bookfind CD-ROM 
  and other sources to produce regular listings of newly-published books in 
  their chosen subject areas, including abstracts and contents pages, as well as 
  bibliographic and ordering details. This information will be sent by 
  electronic mail to TAPin members when new updates are secured.</p> 
  
  <p>Several TAPin members reported that they preferred this method of support, 
  if only because they used electronic mail daily and were alerted to the mail 
  messages when they appeared. With the Internet access, although the references 
  were of interest, it was felt that this service could be backed up by emails 
  alerting them to the new services which had been loaded. TAPin staff had 
  originally shied away from using email as this would still entail TAPin 
  members having to re-key into the browser the address of the resource which 
  can often be quite long.</p> 
  
  <h5>"Core of Champions"</h5>
  
  <p>There is now a core of staff members in the School of Education who have 
  equipped themselves with the skills and confidence necessary to exploit the 
  networked resources. Informal chats (or networking) with the TAPin members 
  indicate that the "added value" the support brought was welcomed. TAPin 
  members felt more confident in using the technology and utilising the support 
  mechanisms that were available. This core of champions will be able to act as 
  cultural change agents within the School of Education. This cultural change 
  will be documented in the forthcoming Impact study of TAPin. TAPin members 
  also reported informally, that they have helped colleagues understand some of 
  the networked information services available. The intention is that this "core 
  of champions" will increase as networked learning grows.</p>
   
  <p>Networked Learner Support requires a good balance of expertise, drawing on 
  a range IT skills, subject knowledge and technical support. The delivery 
  mechanisms outlined help to aid access to, and effective use of, the 
  technology available to academic staff at the University.</p>
   
<h5>  Critical factors in the TAPin Implementation at the University </h5>
  
  <p>The provision of networked learner support described was provided within 
  the confines of a Project aiming to support academic staff in utilising 
  networked resources effectively. That Project targeted individual staff 
  members and was able to provide training and resources for the TAPin Trainer. 
  The implementation does, however, highlight several features which are more 
  widely applicable when efforts are given over to networked support including</p>
   
  <ul>
    <li>the need to develop a profile of skills for subject librarian and the 
    individual learner 
    <li>establish standard of equipment which is to be supported 
    <li>make time to provide effective support 
    <li>build in substantial costs 
    <li>make the support and training appropriate to the researchbase </li></ul>
	
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  
<p>  The methods of support adopted are easily understood and make 
  use of the existing technology, namely electronic mail and the Internet. The 
  flexible nature of the support ensures that support is up to date and can take 
  account of new developments. Barriers to offering support, identified by 
  TAPin, have been addressed including equipment levels and IT skills. The costs 
  involved in supporting the model have yet to be fully realised, although the 
  Impact study on the TAPin project at the end of 1997 will provide feedback on 
  this. It is hoped that this outline of the implementation process of the TAPin 
  model at Birmingham goes some way to informing the process of networked 
  learner support.</p>

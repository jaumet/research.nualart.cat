 <blockquote> This paper describes a collaborative project which has 
  defined requirements and a model for holistic networked learner support. Based 
  on these requirements, a working prototype for a Learning Environment has been 
  developed. Technical, organisational and business issues which have arisen are

  <br><br>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <blockquote><i>'The library, as we know it, is obsolescent … The university, 
    as we know it, is obsolescent … Your kind [ Librarians], and mine 
    [Universities], are clearly at some kind of fork in our road … We must 
    either lead, follow, or get out of the way!'</i> : <br>N. Langenburg, 
  (1)</blockquote>
  
<p>  In the brave new on-line world facing libraries and education, 
  an important component is the availability of learning materials and IT 
  support for access to these materials. However, to fully support learners, yet 
  more is needed. </p>
  
  <p>In general terms, the "more" refers to the structure within which learning 
  takes place for each learner - commonly known as the curriculum - and support 
  for each student as he or she progresses through their learning. How best to 
  provide this holistic concept of networked learner support is a complex 
  question with educational, organisational and technical components, to which 
  we do not yet have the answers. </p>
  
  <p>To help derive some answers the Learning Environment Club was formed. The 
  club consisted of eleven Further Education colleges, together with a software 
  supplier and some associate institutions (2). Whilst the focus was on FE, the 
  principles of the Club's work are applicable to all sectors of education. The 
  remit was to: </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Ascertain key requirements for successful online support of the entire 
    learning process. 
    <li>Develop and evaluate prototype Learning Environment software which 
    fulfils these requirements. 
    <li>Identify the best ways of fitting this kind of technology into the 
    institutions' framework to maximise benefits and minimise problems. 
  </li></ul>
  
<p>  The Club has run from July, 1995 to May, 1997, and trialling is 
  continuing through to 1998. </p>
  
  <p>There has been a fair amount of other work addressing various aspects of 
  online learning. The main differentiating feature of the Learning Environment 
  collaboration has been our holistic approach, with the online resource base at 
  the centre of the model. 
  </p>
  <h2>Key Requirements which were Identified</h2>
  
<p>  These requirements were derived 
  in a series of workshops with Club members (a mixture of information 
  specialists (librarians), tutors, senior college managers, IT support people 
  and curriculum planners): </p>
  
  <p>1) Full support for a resource-based, student-centred open learning model. 
  This implies: </p>
  <p>1a) Making learning materials available to learners in two ways: </p>
  <blockquote>- Through research. The learner locates them him/herself - 
    through searching and browsing - with the resource itself available online - 
    not just the catalogue record (as well as retaining access to books, videos 
    etc. which are not held online). <br>- Guided learning - structured direct 
    access to the learning materials which are at the core of each learner's 
    programme of study. This includes both standard materials for the programme 
    of learning which the learner is pursuing, and materials added in by a tutor 
    to meet the individual needs of a learner.</blockquote>
  <p>1b) Further extending support to the entire learning process, which was 
  defined for our purposes in figure 1. (See also (3).) </p>
  

  <div align="center"><img alt="Figure 1"   height=247 src="bnkfig1.gif" width=421></div>
   <div align="center"><br><strong>Fig. 1 - Learning model for the individual learner</strong></div>
  
  <p>In this model, planning and reflection, with the student taking 
  responsibility for his or her own learning are seen as integral to learning. </p>
  
  <p>1c) Embedding online communication / discussion within the core structure 
  of the learning. </p>
  <p>2) Flexibility is of the essence, both in meeting the individual needs of 
  learners, and adapting the institution's offering rapidly as needs change. 
  This means meeting the needs of individual learners by, for example, support 
  for individually tailored learning programmes, with the capability to provide 
  the learning resources that are just right for a particular individual, and to 
  change these immediately as the needs of the individual (or group) change. 
  <br>It also implies adapting the institution's offering as needs change - not 
  just on a fixed annual cycle. So, for example, existing courses can quickly be 
  adapted to meet the needs of a customer organisation for a particular kind of 
  training for it's workforce. </p>
  <p>3) To achieve this, support for the learner is likely to be provided by a 
  team which may comprise (for example) a curriculum area specialist, a resource 
  centre staff member (or librarian / information specialist), a personal tutor, 
  and a workplace training manager. There is hope that a new, predominantly 
  online, support regime may work better than traditional arrangements, through:</p> 

  <ul>
    <li>One-to-one asynchronous access to the right support person for the 
    student the moment questions arise through (for example) integrated e-mail. 
    Rather than having to wait for next week's tutorial with the one member of 
    staff who is assigned to him or her, the student can direct a question at 
    the appropriate person(s) - e.g. curriculum specialist, resource centre 
    staff, or (importantly!) fellow students, and hope to have a response within 
    a day or two. 
    <li>Availability of up-to-the-minute information on student progress to the 
    team of tutors, with the automated ability to focus in on problem areas - 
    e.g. overdue assignments - enabling tutors to spot any problems as soon as 
    they arise. Effective support for individual student tracking (4) was seen 
    as very important. </li></ul>
	
<p>	4) None of this is possible without the right 
  learning materials being available. Generally speaking, it will be impossible 
  for staff to develop the bulk of the materials for a course themselves. The 
  model has to be sharing and re-use of materials, both within an institution, 
  and between institutions. The learning institution, and its library, should be 
  playing a central role of broker of learning objects.</p> 
  
  <p><b>Key to this are:</b> </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Effective and flexible search facilities for locating the right 
    materials. (Also, ideally, automatic notification facilities when new 
    relevant materials become available.) 
    <li>The added value obtained by cataloguing materials for optimum 
    accessibility. This principle extends to external resources - such as Web 
    pages etc. 
    <li>The design of materials for re-use. This encompasses both adaptation of 
    materials for new purposes and also use of materials in a number of 
    contexts. For example, a resource may relate to a number of curriculum areas 
    and also to key skills in number, communication, etc.. 
    <li>The appropriate level of quality assurance for an institution's 
    materials. </li></ul>
	
  <p>The ability to automatically monitor usage of resources to evaluate their 
  effectiveness and help plan future acquisitions is important. </p>
  
  <p>5) Support for students (and staff) working from a variety of locations, 
  such as home, the workplace, community centres, or open learning centres in 
  the institution. </p>
  <h2>Learning Environment Architecture and Implementation</h2>
  
  <p>To fulfil the requirements for integrated support for the entire learning process, a 
  prototype online Learning Environment was designed and built in a number of 
  phases, with feedback from club members at each stage. The starting point was 
  OLIB(5), an existing commercial library / online resource management system 
  <p>An <b>information model</b> was developed (figure 2), validated with 
  members of the club, and implemented. Because of the methodology and software 
  toolset used (6), rapid incremental development was possible, with comments 
  from users feeding back quickly into the model and the software. In the model, 
  the ovals denote the main kinds of information held (referred to as 
  "domains"). The lines denote links between them.</p> 
  
  <div align="center"><img alt="Figure 2"  height=521 src="bnkfig2.gif" width=525></div>
<div align="center"><br><strong>Figure 2 - Learning Environment Information Mode</strong></div>

  <p>Some significant points are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The curriculum model is split into delivery and assessment strands, 
    following recommended practice in FE (7, 8) enabling greater flexibility in 
    meeting students' needs. </li>
    <li>The model supports active learning, through "activities" which each 
    student undertakes (individually or in a team), and which are supported by 
    learning resources. </li>
    <li>The model supports competency based assessment (as well as other forms). 
    The units can be broken down into sub-units, sub-sub-units etc., all of 
    which can be marked as achieved as appropriate. This will be when the 
    appropriate evidence (either activities or evidence for Accreditation of 
    Prior Learning) is successfully completed and / or when all the sub-units 
    have been achieved. In the current model there is a basic degree of 
    automation of this process of marking chunks of assessment as achieved. This 
    could be extended to provide fairly comprehensive automation. </li>
    <li>Each activity may provide evidence for any number of chunks of 
    assessment. For example, a survey of patient needs could provide evidence 
    for the achievement of elements in a mandatory Health and Social Care unit, 
    but also for elements of key skills units in number and IT. </li>
    <li>When students enrol on a programme (standard or individualised), 
    individual "copies" of the programme, delivery modules, assessment units and 
    activities are automatically made. This means that: </li>
    <ul type=disc>
      <li>the progress of each student is recorded individually </li>
      <li>each student has their own copy of each activity, which they can 
      complete online as appropriate. </li>
      <li>each student's programme and modules can be individually tailored - 
      e.g. providing extra activities to reinforce areas where the student has 
      difficulties, or to challenge and extend able students.</li>
	  </ul>
    <li>Re-use of resources (including activities) across the whole range of the 
    curriculum is supported. </li>
	</ul>
	
<p>	<b>The architecture</b> incorporates the  concept of brokerage of learning objects (9) (fig. 3). Libraries and  librarians have always acted as information brokers between learners, 
  information repositories and information providers. There is a current move to 
  extend this concept (10) to the educational institution as a whole, 
  particularly in the context of electronic information. Rather than being 
  imparters of a fixed body of knowledge to a set of students, learning support 
  staff are being seen as facilitators of learning who responsively direct 
  students to appropriate learning resources and monitor their progress. </p>
  <p>This brokerage adds value to the information by: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>locating it in the context of an individual student's (or group's) 
    programme of study and progression, using the expertise of the tutor.</li> 
    <li>linking it to assessment and accreditation for each student. </li>
    <li>supporting dialogue with the student to help understanding.</li>
	</ul>


<div align="center"><img  alt="Figure 3" height=413 src="bnkfig3.gif" width=568></div>
<div align="center"><br><strong>Figure 3: Learning Environment as Learning Resource broker</strong></div>

  <p>In the Learning Environment, there are currently two prime routes to 
  resources held outside of the institution's boundary, via World Wide Web URLs, 
  or via Z39.50. The latter is an international standard for information 
  exchange between heterogeneous information bases, which allows remote 
  information bases to be queried, and result sets returned in standard format. 
  This capability is being extended in the Learning Environment in two 
  European-funded projects: Renaissance and Universe (11). A third related 
  project, DALI (11), has investigated and implemented a charging model for 
  document delivery from remote sites - a crucial component if this kind of 
  flexible remote access to resources is to become widespread. </p>
  
  <p>The <b>User interface</b> for students, tutors and information managers is 
  based around three modes of interaction in line with requirement 1a above. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Structured mode, through the users' "workspace" where the core 
    information they will most commonly be working with is presented to them. 
    (figure 4). </li>
    <li>Research mode - where the user can formulate queries and explore freely 
    (if they have permissions) the entire information base (figure 5). </li>
    <li>Online communication in context. This is currently is via integrated 
    e-mail, but video-conferencing, etc. could equally be employed. Also, 
    folders of resources can be created and shared for collaborative learning. 
    </li></ul>

  width="800"><img alt="Figure 5" height=200 src="bnkfig51.gif" 
  width=320></a></div>
  
  <p><b>Resources</b> can be located within or outside the LE database. For 
  example, they can be: </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Word-processed documents - either in read-only or (for activities) in 
    updateable mode. </li>
    <li>Adobe Acrobat documents. These allow the embedding of multimedia 
    components, and hyperlinks. (As indeed - though to an arguably lesser extent 
    to most modern word-processors.) </li>
    <li>Multimedia learning resources - which may have been authored using a 
    variety of packages. </li>
    <li>World Wide Web pages anywhere on the Internet. The same considerations 
    that apply to any educational use of the Web obviously apply here, and must 
    be addressed in determining an institution's Internet policy. </li>
    <li>Web pages on the institution's internal intranet (some of which may be 
    copies of pages obtained from the global Internet - but held locally to save 
    on the phone bill, and to avoid the perceived dangers to innocent students 
    lurking out there on the Internet. </li>
    <li>Etc. etc.</li></ul>
	
  <p>In terms of physical location, resources may be held, for example: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Within the LE database </li>
    <li>On a local area network server (which could be a dedicated document 
    server). This may provide advantages in speed of access, but may limit the 
    visibility of the resources (e.g. to users connected over a local area as 
    opposed to wide area network.) </li>
    <li>On the Internet or intranet - referenced in standard Web fashion via a 
    URL (Universal Resource Locator) </li>
    <li>On a CD-ROM, distributed to the students enrolled on a particular 
    programme, and inserted into their own CD-ROM drive. This provides 
    advantages of fast loading for multimedia resources without the expense of 
    high bandwidth network connections. The obvious disadvantage is the 
    inability to update resources without sending out new copies of the CD-ROM, 
    but this may not matter. </li>
    <li>On CD-ROMs mounted on the local network on a CD-ROM jukebox.</li></ul>
	
  <p>The choice of the mixture of strategies to be adopted for mounting 
  resources is one of the major strategic questions an institution faces in 
  developing online learning. </p>
  <p>The provision for online <b>communication / discussion</b> with tutors and 
  with fellow learners may depend on learning style, educational model, 
  confidence of students, degree of support required, etc. Examples of a 
  structure would be: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>At the end of each module of delivery - e.g. e-mailing the tutor(s) to 
    comment on the learning which has taken place in the module being the final 
    activity in the module. </li>
    <li>Ad hoc - when problems or inspirations arise. Almost certainly, this 
    will be important. </li>
    <li>Once a week (This is traditional but perhaps rarely 
appropriate!)</li></ul>

  <p>Incorporating discussion with fellow learners in the process may be as 
  important as (or more important than!) discussion with tutors.  </p>
  
  <p>The Learning Environment was implemented in a client - server environment, 
  supporting access over local or wide area networks (tcp-ip). An Oracle 
  database on the central server(s) holds the information. The client runs on 
  Windows PCs. In principle, the application could equally run over the World 
  Wide Web, with a web browser providing the client, and (for example) Oracle 
  Web Server providing access to the database. Extension to this environment is 
  under consideration.  </p>
  <h2>Strategies for Networked Learner Support</h2>
  
<p>  In the Learning Environment 
  Club, there have typically been three overall roles involved in Learner 
  Support:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>Subject Tutor - the specialist in a curriculum area </li>
    <li>Progression Tutor - the tutor with an overall view of the student's 
    learning needs and progress, who provides counselling around this, etc. </li>
    <li>Information Specialist - also referred to in this paper as "Resource 
    Centre Staff". Providing support around information / resource needs. 
  </li></ul>
  <p>Often, a single person fulfils more than one of these roles, in part or 
  fully. </p> 
  <p>Each of these are involved in the provision of three types of support: </p> 
  <ul>
    <li>Responsive. Providing information and advice in response to students' 
    requests for support. </li>
    <li>Proactive. Providing input for students, either in a scheduled fashion, 
    or as a result of the way a student is progressing (falling behind, showing 
    misunderstanding in assignments, not being stretched, etc.) </li>
    <li>Structural. This is the traditional role of a librarian, but extended 
    into an online context and with more focus on how resources fit into the 
    curriculum. This covers the management of resources (including delivery 
    modules, assessment units etc.) to ensure optimal accessibility. In our 
    case, it also covers the development of new learning programmes; a role 
    which may well be performed by a different person. </li></ul>
  <p>The way that individual staff fit into this matrix will differ between 
  institutions. The description of typical uses of the learning environment, 
  below will make it clear how these types of support operate. </p> 
  
  <h2>Typical Uses of the Learning Environment</h2>
  
  <p>These are described for the  four typical types of user shown in figure 3. </p>
  
  <p><i><b>1) By a Learner</b></i> <br>Tony is enrolled on a modular degree 
  course. He generally works from home - in the evenings or whilst his children 
  are at nursery. However, fellow students on the course who have no computer at 
  home work at a number of open learning centres, on or off campus, or at 
  "Electronic Village Halls" near their homes. </p>
  
  <p>Before starting the course, Tony had a number of meetings with tutors to:</p>
   
  <blockquote>- Identify his learning needs. <br>- Decide on his learning 
    goals . <br>- Formulate an action plan (12) for his learning, and decide on 
    the programme / modules on which he is going to enrol.</blockquote>
	
  <p>This information is maintained (as word-processed documents) within the 
  learning environment, and can be periodically revisited and reassessed. </p>
  
  <p>In a typical learning session, Tony may connect in, and initially check his 
  mail, for example picking up a reply from his tutor about a problem he had 
  yesterday, a couple of responses to points he made in group discussion, and a 
  pointer to a resource from a resource centre staff member in response to a 
  query. He then looks at his learning environment workspace, where the list of 
  activities for the module he is currently working on are shown to him (fig. 
  4). He has just finished one activity, and starts on the next, which is marked 
  as current. It may be, for example, a word processed activity sheet, which 
  Tony completes with help from the list of learning resources attached. These 
  could be, for example, a web page, a multimedia Acrobat document, and an 
  online video. Postits, supplied by the module tutor, and visible just to all 
  the students in this group, explain how each resource might best be used in 
  this context. </p>
  
  <p>In this case, his tutor has added an additional learning resource to help 
  him with the statistical analysis of the activity results, which he has been 
  finding difficult. A "postit" against the resource explains how to use it. 
  (His tutor found it by a search of the college resource bank held on the 
  Learning Environment.) </p>
  
  <p>When Tony has a problem, he can instantly e-mail his tutor, or others in 
  his support team, such as the resource centre staff. To do this, he clicks on 
  the right mouse button over the activity, which brings up the action menu. He 
  selects "e-mail tutor" which brings up his e-mail application, with the "To" 
  box automatically populated with the address of the tutor for this module, and 
  the "About" box populated with the name of the activity. </p>
  
  <p>When the activity is completed, Tony clicks on "Completed" on the action 
  menu, and the next activity automatically becomes current, whilst this one 
  appears in the tutor's folder of activities for marking. </p>
  
  <p>Tony can also freely research the resource base to explore other items that 
  might be relevant. </p>
  
  <p>In this example, Tony is pursuing a fairly standard college course, 
  although there may be a good deal of variation between course members in which 
  optional modules they choose. However, learning programmes may equally be 
  totally individual, on a "pick and mix" basis. There are many possible 
  variations between the extremes of standard college courses and total 
  individuality. For example, many colleges give students diagnostic tests in 
  key skills when they enrol. These can be presented as activities, marked 
  on-line, and based on the results, supplementary chunks of work can be dropped 
  into the student's programme, to catch up on areas of deficiency. 
  <p>From time to time Tony (and his tutors) will wish to see how he is 
  progressing with the assessment side of things, which is visible to both, and 
  is automatically updated as relevant assignments are marked as successful. </p>
  
  <p><i><b>2) By the learning support staff (tutors, resource centre staff 
  etc.)</b></i> </p>
  
  <p>The student's support team monitors progress via </p>
  <blockquote>- direct communication with the student (and each other) - e.g. 
    via integrated e-mail. <br>- a window onto each student's progress and work 
    in their own workspaces. This may, for example, provide an automatically 
    updated list of overdue assignments, allowing the tutor to home in 
    immediately on problems as they arise, and respond and resolve the problem 
    before the student become disillusioned, drops out etc. </blockquote>
	
<p>	Also, 
  they may locate and add in resources to meet individual student's needs, using 
  the capabilities described in (3) below. </p>
  
  <p><i><b>3) By course designers</b></i> </p>
  <p>Location of appropriate materials, and linking them together to provide 
  structured chunks of curriculum is supported by:</p> 
  
  <blockquote>- A wide range of search types, with access via date, subject 
    headings, full text retrieval, curriculum area, author, etc.. <br>- 
    Cross-referencing and browsing capabilities. <br>- Resource sharing via 
    static and dynamic folders. <br>- Drag and drop authoring and structuring 
    capabilities for developing the catalogue and authoring modules of 
    curriculum. </blockquote>
	
<p>	<i><b>4) By resource / information managers</b></i> </p>
  <p>The management of this information is supported online by the standard 
  mechanisms one would expect in a library management system. Authority 
  controlled subject headings, standard classification schemes, etc. can be used 
  to manage and increase accessibility of information. </p>
  <h2>Key Issues for the future</h2>
  
  <p>These are largely organisational and   cultural rather than technical, for example: </p>
  <p>The sourcing, management and sharing of learning resources. Some things 
  that may help are: </p>
  
  <blockquote>- Arrangements for sharing between institutions. <br>- Third 
    Party Brokers. In many cases, libraries are ideally place to play this role. 
    Another example is the Web Site Unit Exchange project - a QUILT initiative 
    to make available Open College Federation accreditation units developed 
    across U.K. colleges (13). <br>- A "component architecture" for resources to 
    facilitate their re-use. <br>- A clear analysis of the economics of buying 
    in materials versus developing them internally, the investment required and 
    the potential returns. Clearly educational institutions may play the role of 
    resource providers (publishers) as well as consumers, but a clear analysis 
    of how this fits the institution's core business is required.</blockquote>
	
<p>	How 
  to "migrate" new approaches and technology into an institution. Some critical 
  success factors may be: </p>
  
  <blockquote>- An effective high-level champion combined with nurturing for 
    staff at the grass-roots. <br>- Catalyst team or staff member, with 
    sufficient resources to support their role. <br>- Demonstration of early 
    success in an area that is small enough to be achievable, but significant 
    enough to excite enthusiasm. <br>- Buy-in from key stakeholders. <br>- 
    Perception that it will make participants' jobs better in some way. <br>- 
    Appropriate focus. <br>- Defined migration paths from initial small-scale 
    success to later widespread achievements. <br>- Defined mechanisms for 
    taking feedback and adapting the introduction strategy based on successes 
    and problems. <br>- A good fit with the institution's (evolving) culture. 
    <br>- Technology that is reliable, has a good user interface and evokes 
    confidence. <br>- Good provision for staff training. </blockquote>
	
<p>	Forthcoming 
  evaluation of the pilot use of the Learning Environment in colleges will 
  provide further insights. </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
  <p>The impact of the convergence of the technologies of 
  computing and telecommunications on our societies, our economies and our 
  universities, will undoubtedly be profound. Like other major shifts in 
  communications the full effect will probably not be known for generations. The 
  pace of change, which is unprecedented and bewildering, can blind us to the 
  fact that we are still at the dawn of this new era. Most of what there is to 
  know about how to realise the great promise of the new technologies is still 
  unlearned. We are pioneers. The territory is unmapped, and any reports from 
  the frontier can only provide partial and provisional information to guide 
  those who follow us.</p>
  
  <p>In this paper I intend to describe the experience we have had at the 
  University of Southern Queensland in providing library input to the 
  development of a course which is being offered world-wide entirely through the 
  Internet. All functions - enrolment, administration, delivery of teaching 
  materials, student interaction, assessment and learner support - operate 
  solely in the Internet environment. The course is a Graduate Certificate (Open 
  and Distance Learning), and it is being showcased at the Commonwealth 
  Ministers of Education in Botswana convention next month as an example of 
  best practice in the new technologies.</p> 
 <p> (<a href="http://www.britcoun.org/commonwealth/convention/ cnvnews.htm"> http://www.britcoun.org/commonwealth/convention/cnvnews.htm</a>)</p>

  <p>The Gods of Technology willing I then hope to demonstrate some of the 
  systems and materials we have developed. Lastly, I’ll discuss some of the 
  lessons and the outstanding questions arising from our experience. 
  
  <h2>Background</h2>
  
  <p>Before I get into the specifics of this particular course 
  it will help if I give you some background about the University of Southern 
  Queensland and its experience in distance education. If we are leaders in this 
  area, and we immodestly think we are, that leadership comes more from our 
  history, our organisation and our culture than from the merits of any 
  particular program.</p>
  
  <p>The University of Southern Queensland has been involved in distance 
  education since 1977. Of its c.16,000 students about two thirds choose this 
  mode. USQ is a leading Australian provider of offshore programs, with students 
  in 42 countries. There are six faculties - Arts, Business, Commerce, 
  Education, Engineering and Surveying, and Sciences. All offer courses by 
  distance education; many are offered both on and off campus. When a course is 
  available in both modes it allows students to move between on-campus and 
  off-campus study if they wish.
  <p>The delivery of distance education courses is organised in a way which has 
  facilitated the move into newer technologies. The basic development structure 
  is the multidisciplinary team which can comprise the following:
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>the content specialist (the examiner) 
    <li>instructional designers 
    <li>materials development staff 
    <li>media services staff (graphics, audio, video) 
    <li>system designers 
    <li>application programmers 
    <li>WWW specialists 
    <li>technical support staff </li></ul>
	
	<p>Many of these people are located in the 
  Distance Education Centre (DEC), which also acts as a production facility with 
  a large staff devoted to computer publishing and mailing. Some of the team are 
  from Information Technology Services and the content specialist is from one of 
  the faculties.</p>
  
  <p>Senior academic staff attached to the Distance Education Centre are active 
  in research in instructional design in the distance environment. Funds for new 
  and experimental development come from income earned from commercial clients 
  and grant agencies. The DEC is the site of the Asia/Pacific Secretariat of the 
  International Council for Distance Education (ICDE) and publishes several 
  academic journals in the field. (For further information on the DEC see <a 
  href="http://www.usq.edu.au/dec/">http://www.usq.edu.au/dec/</a>)
  <p>Library services are available to all distance students within Australia. 
  Requests for loans, photocopies, subject searches and reference help are 
  received by mail, fax, email and a free phone number. Students are not charged 
  for photocopies or outward postage of materials. Training in library skills is 
  given to students who attend on-campus residential schools. Reciprocal 
  borrowing rights with other libraries can also be arranged. 
  <h2>The Flexible Delivery Initiative at USQ</h2>
  
 <p> Obviously a university with 
  our investment in distance education would be foolish if it did not protect 
  that lead in the market by preparing for the online environment. We are doing 
  this through a centrally-funded program called the Flexible Delivery 
  Initiative. Although the concept has developed as we have gone along, we began 
  in 1995 with something called the UCAN (University CAmpus Network) project. 
  The Vice Chancellor’s Committee (VCC), which is the senior management 
  committee of the University, supported the initiative from central funds 
  because:</p>
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>The University as a whole could only move into the new environment if 
    all staff had access to the network and 
    <li>Electronic services from the Library could only be delivered equitably 
    and efficiently if they could reach all academic staff. </li></ul>
  <p>The explicit objectives of UCAN were: 
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>to extend the campus network to all academic offices 
    <li>to equip every member of the academic staff with a networked workstation 

    <li>to maintain a rolling workstation replacement program 
    <li>to provide microcomputer support 
    <li>to provide training in operating systems and software 
    <li>to provide training by Library staff in the use of the Internet and its 
    resources </li></ul>
	
	<p>Provision of training and technical support were seen as 
  crucial to the success of UCAN. Initial installations were completed last 
  year. Training, support, and upgrades to workstations and the network are 
  continuing programs.</p>
  
  <p>With the infrastructure going into place, senior management then turned 
  their minds to application of the technology to teaching programs. A 
  coordinated plan entitled the Flexible Delivery Program was developed. The 
  senior management committee of the program is the VCC itself. This ensures 
  that it is understood and supported at the highest levels of the university. 
  The goal of the Flexible Delivery Program is: 
  
  <blockquote><i>to enhance teaching and learning by incorporating flexible 
    delivery techniques and methods broadly within the University’s academic 
    program</i>.</blockquote>
	
	<p>The term ‘flexible delivery’ was chosen to describe a 
  mode of study that would enable students to learn “what they want, where they 
  want it, when they want it”. It might be said that this is what USQ has been 
  offering all along, and that it is quite deliverable using traditional 
  correspondence methods, but the intent of the Flexible Delivery Program is 
  clearly to move these capacities into a networked environment, with greater or 
  lesser use as appropriate of Web functions like email, CMC, multimedia, online 
  testing, simulation etc.</p>
  
  <p>Important to the success of the program, if it is truly to be a corporate 
  enterprise, is the development of systems and methods which can support 
  institution-wide activity and scale to large numbers of students. It is one 
  thing for an enthusiastic teacher or team to offer a single unit or course 
  from a Web server in a faculty office. It is also reasonably easy to conceive 
  how one would establish a new ‘virtual’ university without the ‘encumbrances’ 
  of existing staff and campus facilities5. It is quite another to tool up a 
  whole established university so that all its functions can be carried out in 
  this environment. However the ultimate goal of our Flexible Delivery Program 
  is no less than that.
   
  <p>Each faculty has been required to develop three year rolling plans for the 
  implementation of flexible delivery. Course development is currently operating 
  at a number of levels:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>single units where the initiative has been taken by a member of the 
    academic staff 
    <li>single units identified by the Faculty as suitable for flexible 
    delivery, for marketing or access or content reasons and 
    <li>‘flagship’ courses in which all units have been translated to flexible 
    delivery. </li></ul>
	
  <p>There are currently two ‘flagship’ courses: the Graduate Certificate that 
  has been offered since last year and which I will discuss further in a moment, 
  and the Master of Professional Accounting which is being offered next 
  semester. The latter was chosen because
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>it is offered entirely in external mode 
    <li>the Faculty (of Commerce) was keen to be involved 
    <li>a sufficient proportion of the current student body was considered 
    likely to have Internet access and 
    <li>the Faculty believed that the development would give them a marketing 
    edge, particularly in Asia. </li></ul>
	
	<p>Among the single units is one for which 
  the author is the examiner (and therefore the developer) called “Issues in 
  Technology and Publishing”. As I will explain later the Library has been 
  heavily involved in all this planning and development and I felt that 
  experience by the University Librarian ‘at the rockface’ would be valuable.

  structure of the program and an indication of the projects included within it:</p>

  <h2>Graduate Certificate (Open and Distance Learning)</h2>
  
<p> The Graduate 
  Certificate (O&amp;DL) is the first accredited course from an Australian 
  University to be delivered entirely via the Internet. The development was 
  funded by grants from the Australian Government and from the AT&amp;T Global 
  Learning Initiative for the International Council for Distance Education. The 
  course offers eleven units and enrolled its first students in 1996. At the 
  time of writing there are 66 students as follows:</p>

  <p>USQ has had considerable experience in developing technology enriched 
  teaching and training materials. Some of this comes from work on sophisticated 
  training packages for commercial clients. But the Grad Cert is of a different 
  order. It was explicitly required to ‘stretch the envelope’ by providing 
  everything on the Web - all instructional materials, all administrative 
  functions, all support services (including library services), all student 
  contact, all assessment.</p>
  
  <p>To meet this challenge a quite large development team was established:</p>
  
  <p>
  <blockquote><i><b>Course Team</b></i><br><i>The team which is responsible 
    for developing and implementing the Graduate Certificate in Open and 
    Distance Learning is constructed of staff from many sections and departments 
    of USQ all working towards a common goal.</i>

<p>I have already mentioned that the multidisciplinary team is the basis of 
  development of all our external courses, but this was the first time that 
  Library staff were included at the development stage. This was partly because 
  of the explicit requirements of the commission, but also I believe because the 
  Library had come to be seen as one of the strongest advocates for moving the 
  University in this direction. As Clifford Lynch, recently appointed Director 
  of CNI, told the Australian Online Ondisc Conference this year “...if we are 
  going to construct effective Internet-based distance education programs, 
  libraries need to be partnered into the planning at a very early stage 
  <sup>4</sup>.</p>
  
  <p>The team is a powerful example of the kind of partnering with faculty and 
  technologists that Sheila Creth recommended for librarians in her Follett 
  lecture last year2. As such it is not a radical step for us. We partner 
  frequently with Information Technology Services in various projects, and work 
  with faculty all the time, but this was the first time all three areas had 
  come together as equals on such a project.
  
  <p>Library input occurred at a number of levels:</p>
  
  <p><b>Development of a quality assured resource base of Internet materials to 
  which students could refer.</b>Dubbed the "Treasure Trove" this was used 
  first by the content expert who was writing each of the units in the course 
  and later by their students. Because surfing the Web looking for suitable 
  sites is very time-consuming, given the difficulties with search engines, the 
  method adopted was as follows. Students were employed at an hourly rate to 
  locate possible sites, under the guidance and supervision of the subject 
  librarians who liaise with each faculty. Sites were then evaluated by the 
  librarian and/or the content expert and run through WebCompass, which 
  automatically generates abstracts to the documents. The “Treasure Trove” is 
  being added to and amended in the light of input from students in the CMC 
  group for each unit. Relevant documents are hyperlinked as appropriate to the 
  course materials.
  
  <p><b>Online access to licensed electronic resources.</b> Provision of 
  networked electronic resources is a priority in the Library’s collection 
  development because we have so many distance students. Full-text resources are 
  particularly valuable to them. The Council of Australian University Librarians 
  (CAUL) consortium purchases of databases mounted on AARNET have been very 
  useful to us, and students can also access networked CD-ROMs held on campus. 
  The total number of databases currently available thus is 163 including nine 
  with full-text.
  <p><b>Ad-hoc library assistance. </b>A virtual reference desk was established 
  for students in the Graduate Certificate. 
  
  <h2>Demonstration</h2>
  
  <p>Better than any explanation is a demonstration of the 
  Intranet environment in which the Graduate Certificate is offered, and the 
  structure and functionality of the various modules through which teaching and 
  learning occurs.</p> 
  
  <h2>Issues arising from our experience with the Graduate 
  Certificate</h2>
  
<h3>Issues concerning the quality of information:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>quality of selection processes 
    <li>currency of links 
    <li>stability of links 
    <li>quality of metadata 
    <li>discipline differences </li></ul>
  <p>At the moment the judgment on the relevance of links is made by the content 
  expert and/or the librarian, choosing initially from among the collection 
  assembled by the student assistant. The development and application of good 
  metadata standards will assist in the future, one hopes. 
  <p>In considering the work involved in establishing a resource bank of 
  Internet materials we have to recognise that the volatility of the Net implies 
  continuing maintenance to ensure that links provided are still valid and that 
  the collection is kept current by adding new materials as they are discovered. 
  At the end of the first semester of the Grad Cert a check revealed that six 
  percent of the links provided were no longer operative. 
  <p>We will clearly need to introduce some software to automatically sweep the 
  links and alert us to any which have disappeared. There is the added problem 
  that the content of documents can change, and at the moment that can only be 
  determined by actually visiting the site. Widespread adoption of good metadata 
  standards, including a ‘last updated’ field, will hopefully make this easier.
  <p>To address the problem of stability we chose to archive documents that were 
  considered core. In this respect they became like the printed books of 
  readings which are part of the traditional study package for distance students 
  and, as with those readings, copyright clearance was sought for each document 
  before inclusion in the archive.
  <p>The Grad Cert is in a field where there is an abundance of material 
  available on the Web, particularly in those units that deal with multimedia. 
  However as anyone will know this cannot be assumed for all discipline areas at 
  present, and this consideration would affect the decision to offer a course 
  solely through the Internet.
  
<h3> Intellectual property issues:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>licences for databases 
    <li>security 
    <li>electronic reserve 
    <li>copyright in teaching materials </li></ul>
	
  <p>IP is of course the big one. Until copyright laws are amended to take 
  account of the digital environment it will be much harder to provide library 
  services to learners than to provide course materials4. Libraries need 
  predictable costs, and they have to know where the legal limits are. I’m sure 
  the present situation is a source of as much frustration here as it is in 
  Australia. 
  <p>At USQ we insist on database licences that are not limited by physical site 
  because of our large distance student numbers. We need our students to be able 
  to access our databases from anywhere in the world. Databases are therefore 
  licensed for use by all members of the university, the members being defined 
  as those staff and students who have an account on the relevant server. For 
  this to work we have to be able to satisfy the vendors that our security is 
  adequate to prevent unauthorised access. 
  <p>The student intranet that we have recently developed (USQconnect) provides 
  a secure customised gateway for each student and gives us the option, if we 
  need it, of limiting access according to the course in which the student is 
  enrolled. This may in the future enable us to negotiate licences for a sub-set 
  of the population with those vendors who presently price by total enrolment. 
  <p>We would dearly love to move to establish an electronic reserve collection 
  of scanned documents but are stymied by the copyright impasse. I will not bore 
  you with the details but at the moment there is a standoff between the 
  Australian Universities and the collecting agency, which it seems only the 
  court can resolve unless the law changes. Either way it will take some time. 
  <p>For universities planning to offer courses in the Internet environment the 
  question of copyright of teaching materials is crucial. At USQ copyright of 
  study books for distance education programs written by academic staff is held 
  by the University. It is difficult to see how institutions can secure the 
  considerable investment in development of these courses without such a 
  provision. However in universities where academic staff have always had 
  personal copyright in anything they produced there is bound to be resistance 
  to such a move. 
  
 <h3> Skills issues:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>training of librarians 
    <li>training of academic staff 
    <li>training of students </li></ul>
  <p>The crucial importance of these issues has been generally recognised if not 
  always by the allocation of sufficient budget. 
  <p>At USQ the UCAN campus network project provided for training of the 
  academic staff in Internet use by librarians. The latter were prepared for 
  this task with about 200 hours of training. They were relieved of rostered 
  public desk duties (extra staff were employed) so that they had time for these 
  new responsibilities. Obviously they are also expected to keep their skills 
  up-to-date. 
  <p>Regular training courses in Internet resources offered by the Library have 
  attracted about 340 academic staff (from about 450). Training is also 
  available to them in CMC and Web publishing. 
  <p>The students who enrolled in the Graduate Certificate were less experienced 
  in using the Internet than one might have expected. The Library and 
  instructional designers from the DEC are therefore jointly developing an 
  online training course to assist them. In this we are building on our 
  experience in producing award-winning generic library skills packages for the 
  Open Learning Agency of Australia. 
  
 <h3>Costs issues:</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>development costs 
    <li>Internet traffic costs 
    <li>dual delivery costs 
    <li>who pays? </li></ul>
  <p>We can’t claim yet to be able to draw final lessons about development costs 
  from our experience with the Grad Cert. As mentioned, it was supported by 
  external grants and involved an out of the ordinary commitment by all 
  involved, as is usually the case with projects which are breaking new ground. 
  The development and operation of the Master of Professional Accounting, which 
  is the next full course on stream, will give a much better indication because 
  it is being developed with existing resources and is a mainstream offering. 
  However it can be said that our experience gives no encouragement to those who 
  are expecting Internet delivery of courses to lower costs. Participation in 
  unit newsgroups and Internet Chat sessions, and the ability of students to 
  email lecturers direct, make extra demands on staff time. 
  <p>In Australia universities are charged for their use of the Internet on the 
  basis of incoming traffic. Our experience, which I think is universally 
  shared, is that if students are given unlimited access to the Internet a very 
  large proportion of this traffic is unrelated to their studies. USQconnect, 
  our intranet, allows us to ration student Internet access according to the 
  demands of their particular course and will therefore keep our costs down. We 
  are also containing costs by encouraging students to use Internet Service 
  Providers rather than coming through our modem pool. 
  <p>The Graduate Certificate is a new course which has been developed 
  specifically for the Internet and is offered only in that mode. The Masters of 
  Professional Accounting is already offered in print mode. It therefore has an 
  established student base not all of whom will have Internet access, nor can it 
  be assumed that potential students will have that facility. 
  <p>For the time being therefore the MPA will be offered in dual mode with the 
  student being able to select their preferred option. We may have to do the 
  same in any course where we want to maximise our market. However the costs of 
  maintaining both modes will be significant and at some time we will presumably 
  have to make a decision about how long we can carry those extra costs. One 
  possible option is that Internet delivery becomes the standard with students 
  paying an extra fee if they want the print version. 
  <p>Clearly Internet delivery moves some costs to the student which are 
  presently borne by the university. The development of secure financial 
  Internet financial transactions opens the possibility for user-pays 
  arrangements that may come to apply to quite small transactions for support 
  services, a scenario that may be inevitable if fair use does not survive 
  reform of the copyright law. 
  
  <h3>Workforce issues:</h3> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>students vs. librarians 
    <li>faculty vs. librarians 
    <li>technologists vs. librarians 
    <li>support staff vs. professional staff 
    <li>what do we stop doing? </li></ul>
	
  <p>The list above suggests that it’s librarians vs. the world. In fact I’m 
  absolutely sure that the best outcomes will be achieved when librarians work 
  with others as we have done at USQ on this project. Questions remain however 
  about how each will contribute. The environment certainly makes it easier for 
  other sources to be the first option for information and advice. Students may 
  go first to the lecturer’s homepage. At USQ that is the place where they will 
  find suggestions about resources that the lecturer has discovered since last 
  revising the course. The Grad Cert has in some units established reference 
  groups of experts to whom students can refer problems and questions. Experts 
  are located around the world and have agreed to be a resource for these 
  particular students who may well prefer them to librarians as sources of 
  advice about the literature in their field. There is no technical reason why 
  librarians at other institutions could not be included in the reference group 
  if they have access to a superior collection, or are operating in a different 
  time-zone. Arvan suggests that the possible development of an external labour 
  market for instructors in this way will lead to cost savings1 but as our 
  ‘experts’ are all volunteers we cannot say that our experience lends weight to 
  his theory. 
  <p>Involvement by librarians in online teaching and support of one kind and 
  another will require a re-think of their priorities. If our professional staff 
  are to be as competent in the digital environment as they are in print we need 
  to rethink our staff profiles and move more responsibility to 
  para-professionals. And when too many demands are being made on them all we 
  also need to ask what we can stop doing. 
  
  <h3>Quality of education issues: </h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li>free-range vs. pre-selected readings 
    <li>imputed time costs 
    <li>interactive opportunities 
    <li>group learning </li></ul>
  <p>It has been an article of faith with librarians that pre-selected readings 
  were pedagogically unsound, that the student should be encouraged to read 
  widely and explore for themselves in a well-endowed library. The argument in 
  the past centred on the use and abuse of reserve collections but it translates 
  well to the digital environment3. In the Grad Cert we gave our students access 
  to reputable digital resources in the databases to which we subscribe, and the 
  “Treasure Trove” provided extra selected resources. Beyond that as we all know 
  the Internet is wild, and exploring it is nothing like using a good library. 
  <p>It is worth bearing in mind that the major market for Internet delivery 
  will be with adult learners who are adding to their qualifications or skills. 
  The kind of broad educational development represented by the minimally guided 
  undergraduate at loose in a good library is probably not a priority with this 
  group. Arvan reminds us that in calculating the cost of education we rarely 
  include the cost of students’ time, and for adult students time is precious 
  and saving it adds to the quality of their experience. 
  <p>One of the most obvious and easily documented advantages of the online 
  environment is the opportunity for interaction between teacher and pupil and 
  among the students. Teachers who have used CMC in relatively large classes at 
  USQ report that interactivity is better than in the face-to-face mode because, 
  if the discussion is properly led, more are able and feel free to contribute. 
  There is plenty of experience now also that attests to the effectiveness of 
  group learning in this environment. 
  
  <h3>Efficiency/convenience issues:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>role of library catalogue 
    <li>delivery of print to desktop </li></ul>
  <p>The existing library catalogue is of limited usefulness to the distant 
  online learner, pointing as it does almost exclusively to print materials on 
  shelves far away. If our libraries are to support our online learners properly 
  the catalogue must become a source of information about materials in all 
  formats in the host library and beyond it. Ideally the user should be able to 
  move from locating the record of the item to the item itself or to an 
  electronic form which enables them to order an electronic copy of the item for 
  delivery to their desktop. 
  <p>The new generation of library catalogues will hyperlink users from the 
  catalogue record to the item so it can be downloaded to the user’s 
  workstation. If the item is available only in print, delivery to the 
  workstation will require placement of an order for a copy to be digitised and 
  emailed. Two document delivery projects with which the author is associated 
  and which are supported by JISC (the JEDDS and CILLA projects) are bringing 
  this scenario closer. <br>(For details see: <a 
  href="http://www.gu.edu.au/alib/iii/docdel/jeddshom.htm">http://www.gu.edu.au/alib/iii/docdel/jeddshom.htm</a> 
  and <a 
  href="http://www.gu.edu.au/alib/iii/docdel/cilla/">http://www.gu.edu.au/alib/iii/docdel/cilla/</a>) 

  <h3>Scalability issues:</h3> 
  
  <p>This is a question with which we are now 
  wrestling. The Grad Cert delivers a sophisticated course to a relatively small 
  number of students. How do we translate our experience to courses which number 
  students in the hundreds? We are sure that the design and capacity of 
  supporting systems and infrastructure is of prime importance. We also know 
  that some of the more time-consuming interactivity may have to be redesigned, 
  perhaps by using student tutors. The MPA will take us a little further towards 
  delivering mass education online and in a year or so there may be other 
  lessons to pass on.</p>

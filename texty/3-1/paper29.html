  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
 <p> New educational practice in higher education and the need 
  for continuing education general in the society creates new ways in the 
  collaboration between academics, students and information professionals. 
  Entering the information age focus has been on information literacy and 
  preparing students for lifelong learning. Networked learning represent a 
  particular form of information technology support to enhance this development.
  <p>P.Levy and S.Fowell have defined networked learning as learning programmes 
  or activities implemented via internet-based computer-mediated communication, 
  and using networked information resources (1). They state that networked 
  learning is becoming an essential part of education and this will give the 
  librarian a new professional practice termed networked learner support (2). It 
  is the aim of our study to characterise more closely some of the issues of 
  this new professional role of the librarian.</p>
  
  <p>According to Mary Ellen Larson in a text from 1990 the assistance of 
  networks, containing communities for teaching and learning, requires that the 
  training of the librarians shifts its focus from a source-orientation to a 
  process-orientation. If one accepts the concept of a collaborative librarian 
  who handles the reference assistance and act as intermediary within a 
  developed network community, the process-orientation has to substitute the 
  source-orientation. However, a training in special activities is then 
  necessary. She emphasises the skills needed to perform these processes 
  properly and in this way she outlines a new role. The skills and required 
  knowledge is according to her: (a) communication skills (b) question 
  formulation and refinement skills (c) organisational skills defined as the 
  implementering of a formal strategic planning process and its function in 
  encouraging small group development (d) interpretation skills defined as 
  identifying learning tasks, analysing these within the framework of various 
  learning theories, and implementing instructional programs (e) database 
  organisation (3).</p> 
  
  <p>This list of required skills gave us the inspiration to discuss and 
  investigate the role of the librarian in networked learning with specific 
  regard to the communicative and organisational competencies. First of all, the 
  list seemed to contain functions which delivered associations not only to the 
  librarian but also to the facilitator of a networked group communication. 
  Therefore, the central question became: What are the differences and 
  similarities between the role of the librarian and of the facilitator in 
  relation to the networked learning process?</p>
  
  <p>The aim of the paper is to analyse the role of the facilitator and to 
  identify any possible connection between the competencies of the facilitator 
  and the librarian. It is our belief that the role of the facilitator is 
  characterised by qualifications close related to the ones of the librarian. It 
  is likely to imagine, that the traditional intermediary function of the 
  librarian by its nature could create a basis for the role of the facilitator 
  in a networked community.</p>
   
  <h2>The facilitation</h2>
  
  <p>We wanted to analyse the role of the facilitator in a 
  networked community. We took our starting point in literature dealing with 
  groupware, and chose facilitation as the central subject. By help of the 
  selected literature we will briefly describe a proposal for a list of the 
  facilitators role functions, and present some experiences from a selected 
  case. On the background of these informations we have analysed our own case, 
  an online conference from 1995, with the purpose of identifying the role of 
  the facilitator - the strengths and weaknesses of being a pilot in an 
  electronic environment. By taking a closer look at the tools and interventions 
  used by the facilitator it might be possible to identify how communication in 
  the group is managed in relation to the defined objectives.</p>
  
  <p>Facilitation is viewed as a process and a set of functions or activities 
  that get carried out before, during and after a meeting to help the group to 
  achieve its own outcomes. The article “Facilitation: The human side of 
  groupware” by V. K. Clawson and R. P. Bostrom from 1993 (4) presents a model 
  outlining 16 critical functions/dimensions of the facilitator role (see 
  fig.1).</p>
   
  
 
  <blockquote>1. Promotes ownership and encourages group responsibility<br>2. 
    Demonstrate self-awareness and self-expression<br>3. Appropriate selects and 
    prepares technology<br>4. Listens to, clarifies, and integrates 
    information<br>5. Develops and asks the “right” questions<br>6. Keeps group 
    focused on outcome/task<br>7. Creates comfort with and promotes 
    understanding of the technology and technology outputs<br>8. Creates and 
    reinforces and open, positive and participative environment<br>9. Actively 
    builds rapport and relationship<br>10. Presents information to group<br>11. 
    Demonstrates flexibility<br>12. Plans and designs the meeting process<br>13. 
    Manages conflict and negative emotions constructively<br>14. Understands 
    technology and its capabilities<br>15. Encourages/support multiple 
    perspectives<br>16. Direct and manages the meetings </blockquote>
	 <div align="center"><br><strong>Fig.1. Facilitator role dimensions</strong> </div>
	
	
	<p>On the basis 
  of 235 reports of effective and ineffective facilitation Clawson and Bostrom 
  have identified these 16 behaviorally grounded role dimensions. From a pilot 
  study they found that specifically the dimension ´plans and designs meeting´ 
  was perceived as the most important function (6).</p>
   
  <p>In an article from 1995 R.P.Bostrom et al. describes a case study 
  concerning a meeting using multiple group support systems and manual methods 
  (7). It is our opinion that the findings of this study mainly confirm the list 
  of dimensions mentioned above. Further, it seems to us that it extends the 
  description of the facilitator role, namely concerning the aspect of a group 
  understanding development.</p> 
  <p>In the article, it is described how the process of the meeting have to 
  contain appropriate support for the group understanding development among the 
  participants. This dimension is important for the development of a 
  communication process. The possibility of realising this kind of group 
  development among the participants depends, to high degree, on the meeting 
  design. The proposed meeting design of the article is a three-stage model (8). 
  In the first stage the group share opinions. The outcome is an unordered list 
  of issues. In the second stage, the list is classified into less than 10 
  broader topics. Further, the process intends to help the group in focussing on 
  what is important. Finally, the third stage has to uncover the relationship 
  between the most important items. This last stage gives the possibility to 
  plan for future problem solving actions.</p> 
  <p>We agree with the importance of a group understanding development, not only 
  in the case mentioned, but in general for a network learning environment. In 
  the list above, we see the described group understanding development partly 
  presented by the dimensions 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 16 focusing on 
  different communicative competencies. In the process from the first stage to 
  the second, the facilitator has the assignment to build up a general 
  understanding among the participants for making discussions possible. Building 
  up this understanding he/she find particularly use of dimension 4 (listens to 
  and integrates information), dimension 15 (supports multiple perspectives) and 
  dimension 16 (manages the meetings). Then, it seems necessary for the 
  facilitator to build up a sort of paradigm thinking or a sort of knowledge 
  model, to make a framework for further discussions. Of course he/she has to 
  support the participants in their learning processes by making attention to 
  their own perspectives, listen to them and integrate their information. 
  However the facilitator too has in one or another degree to persuade them to 
  accept the change from a unordered list of issues to an ordered one of broader 
  topics. The model of the three stages is the answer of the problem of how to 
  find the base of a communication, i.e. a communication with the intention of 
  being problem solving.</p> 
  
  <h2>3. The role of the facilitator: a case study</h2>
  
 <p> We have now described a 
  proposal for the role dimensions of the facilitator in relation to the meeting 
  design. Now, we will use this proposal as a framework for analysing our 
  selected case of a networked community.
  <p>The case is an online conference named “The Electronic Conference on 
  Universal Access” which took place in three weeks - during September 11th 
  -October 2nd 1995. The conference topic was to discuss how to ensure the 
  public in a democratic society universal access to internet. The conference 
  was arranged by The Danish Board of Technology from the Ministry of Research.</p>
   
  <p>The conference had in total 94 contributions (we use below the term 
  ´letters´ as well), received from about 46 persons. In total the conference 
  had 548 participants. It was decided from the beginning of the conference that 
  the discussion got a period of three weeks. All the participants had a equal 
  chance to publish their contributions during the discussion. The facilitator 
  was only one person, but was supported by a technical expert. In the beginning 
  all contributions were published in their complete extent. Later on, when the 
  discussion developed and the number of contributions expanded, the facilitator 
  went in and cuts some. It too happens that the facilitator gave referees of 
  the contributions at the same time as they were published.</p>
   
  <p>The first stage in the meeting can be described by the followings: The 
  conference started when a selected panel of five persons gave their 
  contributions about the topic of the conference “the universal access”. It was 
  presentations of the topic, considered from five different point of views. We 
  can called it the first stage in the problem comprehension. The outcome was an 
  unordered list of issues.</p>
  
  <p>In the second stage, the contributions from the participants started to 
  come in. In the beginning, the facilitator summed up the first seven letters 
  by making a list of three central questions/issues. He too gave short referees 
  of the following contributions, trying to give the participants a sort of 
  overview. Some of the contributions contained comments to both the 
  presentations of the panel and to following letters. At the same time there 
  was a discussion of some technical problems and - what is maybe of specific 
  interest - of the mode of communication itself.</p>
   
  <p>In this second stage, the facilitator used both formal and informal kinds 
  of languages. Further, he tried to give the participants the inspiration of an 
  analysing relation to the topic of the conference. A couple of participants 
  made attention to the problem about how to build up the norms for the 
  communication. Thus, some were aware of the need of an appropriate support for 
  a group understanding development.</p>
  
  <p>During the discussion, the facilitator intervened by asking questions. The 
  intention seemed to be to clarify the central issues. Further, he summed up by 
  making lists of the central questions. Once in a while, he drew up the 
  discussion. After two weeks, when the number of contributions were as most, 
  the letters got advanced publicity and classified in relation to a subject 
  index. Summarizing we can say that the facilitator tried to identify the areas 
  of focus, which had relevance for the group.</p>
  
  <p>The third stage began when the facilitator during the last days of the 
  three weeks gave the participants a proposal for a synopsis and a conclusion. 
  At once his proposal got a reaction from the participants. A couple of 
  contributions commented the contents of the proposal. Once again, the letters 
  got advanced publicity by the facilitator and were categorised by an index of 
  selected subjects. Finally, he gave a new synopsis and some new conclusions 
  formulated with more details than before. In this final process he made an 
  evaluation of the last group of contributions considered as a result of his 
  proposals of a synopsis and conclusion. After this, he ended the conference.</p>
  
  <p>As shown in the case study, the facilitator tried to develop the group 
  understanding from the unordered list of issues to more ordered ones. The 
  ordered lists of issues changed over time. The changes seemed to be quite 
  accidental. Each of the lists were produced of the facilitator on the basis of 
  the last received contributions. He translated the words and the contents of 
  the contributions to terms, which could be the groups own. Thus, he 
  systematized the terminology of the group. He tried to listen, to clarify and 
  integrate information from the participants. He used some of the facilitator 
  role dimensions, which we above sorted out as a list of communicative 
  competencies. At the same time as he managed the communication he regarded the 
  needs of the participants. The use of an informal language can be seen in the 
  perspective of the needs of the participants. However, concerning the problem 
  of the changes in the ordered lists, he maybe needed some tools to obtain the 
  continuity in the process of systematizing.</p>
  <p>In the process like the described we see a parallel between the role of the 
  facilitator and the intermediary role of a librarian. We find this in two 
  ways. Firstly, the parallel can be drawn in the moment where the translation 
  of the words and contents of the contributions to a more systematized 
  terminology went off. Secondly, there is a similarity concerning the 
  considerations of the needs of the participants for the support of a problem 
  solving communication. To describe this more closely we have to define and 
  describe the intermediary role.</p> 
  
  <h2>4. The intermediary functions</h2>
  
<p>  An intermediary is defined by Peter 
  Ingwersen (8) as “A person or mechanism placed physically between IR 
  [Information Retrieval] system(s) and actual user with the purpose to 
  transform interactively requests for information to query formulations that 
  suit the retrieval components of one or several IR systems, to model and 
  support the actual user as to his information need and underlying goals, and 
  to provide information of potential value to that user from IR systems.”
  <p>Traditionally a human intermediary is a librarian or an information 
  specialist. An IR system includes in its widest sense text-representations, 
  classification- and indexing-systems and IR techniques in catalogues and 
  databases or other information sources. However, research in this field have 
  mainly been directed into the area of implementing non-human intermediary 
  functions into online IR-systems (i.e. databases) through user-interfaces and 
  system settings. Inspiration derives from empirical studies of IR interaction 
  between user, intermediary and IR systems. In spite of this, our focus in this 
  paper is on the human intermediary - the librarian or the information 
  specialist.</p>
  
  <p>An intermediary is a part of the information seeking process. This process 
  is initiated when the user recognize an information problem or an information 
  need. Below, we have listed the elements of the information seeking process, 
  where the user-intermediary interaction is central (9). See fig.2.</p>



  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li>Pre-search interaction with human or computer intermediary 
      <li>Pre-search formulation of search strategy/source-selection/query 
      <li>Searching activity 
      <li>Initial evaluation of results 
      <li>Reformulation of problem/information problem/request/query/strategy 
      </li></ul></blockquote>
	    <div align="center"><br><strong>Fig.2 The elements of the information seeking process</strong></div>
	  
	  <p>The information seeking process is an iterative process 
  where the interaction of the user-intermediary-IR system may continue until 
  the information problem is solved. Essential for us seems the 
  pre-search-elements which include a translation of users request into a query 
  formulation. This requires a dialogue between user and the human intermediary 
  to recover the information need or problem of the user. The dialogue is often 
  named as the pre-search interview. Because the requests of the users often are 
  an expression of a compromised need (10), the interview is crucial in 
  identifying the “true” information need. Therefore, it requires good 
  communicative and questionning skills of the intermediary.</p>
   
  <p>In relation to the interview, Peter Ingwersen mentions eight major 
  intermediary functions (11):</p>
  
  <p>a) Dialogue function(s) - directed towards user and IR systems in order to 
  learn about these components;<br>b) Domain knowledge or model function - to 
  understand information need and problem space underlying the request;<br>c) 
  Request modelling function - to translate request inte query;<br>d) Systems 
  model building functions - to understand the features of the IR systems;<br>e) 
  Systems selection function - to choose an adequate IR system;<br>f) Matching 
  function - to search the IR system with an IR technique;<br>g) System feedback 
  function - to obtain conceptual feedback from IR systems to support the 
  user;<br>h) Rule function - to control and guide other functions procedures.</p>
  
  <p>We have compared the above mentioned 16 role dimensions of the facilitator 
  with these the intermediary functions. We found that of the 16 role dimensions 
  the following five were relevant in describing the intermediary:</p> 
  <p>3. Appropriate selects and prepares technology<br>4. Listens to, clarifies, 
  and integrates information<br>5. Develops and asks the “right” 
  questions<br>14. Understands technology and its capabilities<br>15. 
  Encourage/support multiple perspectives</p>
  <p>Number 4, 5 and 15 are identical to the pre-search interview/dialogue and 
  describe the process of identifying users information needs. Number 3 and 14 
  match the systems model building functions and the systems selection function.</p>
  <p>Now, if we once again take a look at the elements of the information 
  seeking process, listed above in fig.2, we notice that both the two pre-search 
  activities and the element of a reformulation of the problem are contained in 
  the five facilitator role dimensions mentioned above. Still, there are two 
  elements which have not been mentioned at all - the searching activity and the 
  initial evaluation of results. Firstly, we cannot exclude that one or another 
  facilitator is using the searching activity. Thus, the role of the facilitator 
  may involve a presentation of an external information to the group (see the 
  role dimension number 10 of the facilitator: Presents information to the 
  group) and maybe this information is based on a searching activity. Secondly, 
  we cannot either exclude that the facilitator is using an initial evaluation 
  of results of a searching activity. In our case study, we saw for instance how 
  the facilitator evaluates a group of contributions from the participants as a 
  result of his proposals of synopsis and conclusion. In the same way, a 
  facilitator could evaluate the results of the searching and problem solving 
  activity. Still, we have to dwell on these two elements, when we in the next 
  paragraph discuss the integration of the intermediary functions with the role 
  dimensions of the facilitator.</p> 
  <h2>5. Integrating the intermediary functions with the facilitator role 
  </h2>
  
 <p> As shown, there are in both roles elements of communication, 
  identification and translation of information needs. The facilitator does not 
  solve information problems in the same way as the intermediary, but as long as 
  he/she considers the communication and information needs of the participants 
  in one way or another, he/she makes an identification of the needs. The 
  facilitator shows the function of identification, when he reformulates the 
  problems in an ordered list of issues. Finally, the similarity between the two 
  roles also concerns the process of systematizing the terminology of the 
  participants/the user.</p>
  
  <p>However, there are also important differences between the two roles. We 
  have found four. Firstly, the intermediary role of the librarian is a function 
  between the individual information needs and an IR system, while the 
  facilitator role is a function concerning the organisation of a group 
  communication. By considering the individual needs respectively the groups we 
  have the first central difference. We will return to this discrepancy.</p>
  <p>Secondly, the intermediary function exists in the perspective of a learning 
  orientation, while the facilitator role may to some degree have a 
  predetermined outcome-orientation. The outcome-orientation will among others 
  have consequences for the content of the ordered list The list will not only 
  be a result of the contributions and needs of the participants, but will also 
  depend on some external variables.</p>
  <p>Thirdly, as mentioned above the searching activity from the information 
  seeking process of the librarian is not among the 16 role dimensions of the 
  facilitator but this does not exclude its existence. The difference between 
  the librarian and the facilitator is that the searching activity for the last 
  one does not need to be carried out from the consideration of the information 
  needs of the participants. Instead, it may be a result of the 
  outcome-orientation mentioned above. This is an important distinction, we have 
  to remember.</p> 
  <p>Finally, also mentioned above, the initial evaluation of the results of the 
  searching activity is not among the facilitator role dimensions but we can 
  neither exlude the existence of this dimensions. One of the observations of 
  the case study was, that the ordered lists of central issues changed over time 
  and these changes seemed to be quite accidental. Each of the ordered lists 
  were produced on the basis of the last received contributions. Would that have 
  happened if he over time had evaluated the results of his problem 
  identifications in relation to the participants? Is the changes over time of 
  the ordered lists a consequence of the missing evaluations? If that is the 
  case, then the evaluations might be important with regard to the group 
  understanding development.</p> 
  <p>Another question concerning the same element is, whether a evaluation of 
  results in relation to a group is quite another thing, than the librarians 
  evaluation in relation to the individual. Does the distinction between 
  individual needs respectively the groups means anything for the kind of 
  evaluation which will be the result of the process? All we are about to state 
  are, that in relation to networked communication, evaluations of problem 
  solving activities for individuals as well as for groups, is equally important 
  for the group understanding development.</p>
  <p>Summarising our results we find, that the integration of the intermediary 
  functions with the facilitator role has to be followed up by two central 
  distinctions. The first one concerns the element of searching activity. We 
  have to be aware of two kinds of searching activities, one which is based on 
  the participants needs and the other which is based on an outcome orientation. 
  In this case, the librarian has only interest in the first one but the 
  facilitator in both. The second distinction concerns the evaluation of the 
  results. We see two kinds of evaluations, namely one which handle these 
  activities in relation to the group and the other which handle the activities 
  in relation to the individual. In this case the librarian as well as the 
  facilitator have interest in both.</p> 
  <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
  
  <p>As mentioned in the beginning it was the aim of our 
  study to characterise more closely some of the issues of the new professional 
  role of the librarian in networked learner support. In relation to that the 
  central question became: what is in fact the similarities and the differences 
  between the facilitator role and the intermediary role of the librarian? We 
  had the belief that the intermediary function could create a basis for the 
  role of the facilitator. After defining and describing the two roles we can 
  conclude, that we cannot refuse this supposition. We have a list of 
  similarities between the two roles concerning the communication, the 
  identification of information needs, the translation of participants 
  formulations to a more systematized terminology and lastly, the possibility of 
  using a searching activity as well as evaluation of the results. The important 
  difference is that the searching activity might for the facilitator be carried 
  out on the basis of an predetermined outcome-orientation and not on the 
  background of the information needs of the participants. This is not possible 
  within the intermediary role of the librarian.</p>
   
  <p>Further, we cannot either refuse that the role of the intermediary in fact 
  may strengthen the role of the facilitator concerning the support of the group 
  understanding development. The process of the evaluations of the problem 
  solving activities in relation to the information needs of the participants 
  might support the group understanding development. According to the model of 
  the facilitation, the group understanding development seems very important for 
  the success of all kinds of networked communication, but it is first of all in 
  the intermediary role that we see the searching activity as well as the 
  evaluation of the results explicit formulated. In this way, the intermediary 
  role may develop the formulations of the role of the facilitator.</p> 
  <p>At the same time, we have to state that the role of the facilitator may 
  develop the formulations of role of the librarian. In the role dimensions of 
  the facilitator we found the formulations concerning the identification and 
  the translation of the needs of the group. This is of course a dimension, 
  which should create the librarians attention. In the future, the theory of the 
  intermediary functions might eventually develop concerning the interaction 
  between the group and the human intermediary.</p>

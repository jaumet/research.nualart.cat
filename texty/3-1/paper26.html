  <br><br>
  
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  
<p>The University of Lincolnshire and Humberside’s (ULH)  mission is: </p>
 
  <blockquote><i>“To provide our students world-wide with the best employment 
    prospects and to equip them to become life-long learners”.</i> </blockquote>
	
<p>	To achieve this ULH has developed a University Skills and Capability Curriculum 
  (USCC) that is core for all students at all three levels of study. At level 
  one of USCC there is the Effective Learning Programme (ELP). The main aim of 
  ELP is to develop independent life long learners. 1996 was the first full year 
  of delivery of ELP. This has been fully evaluated and is being modified in the 
  light of the evaluation report. However ELP started off as Learning to Learn 
  (L2L). L2L was two years in development before being piloted. Since those 
  early days of development the technology and the available software have 
  changed significantly. The development phases reflect this. Outlined below are 
  the brief details of the outcomes of the L2L pilots and the changes in 
  systems, resources and staff roles that are required to develop and implement 
  ELP.</p> 
  
  <h2>Learning to Learn</h2>
  
 <p> In late1993 ULH made a decision to develop a core 
  curriculum for students’ learning and study skills at level one. The brief was 
  to use the University’s computer networks and libraries so that students, and 
  their tutors could access this core curriculum on any University campus. 
  Development teams were established. These included staff from the recently 
  converged department of Learning Support (bringing together the library and 
  academic computing staff), and a number of academic staff from across the 
  University. By 1995 the University was ready to pilot Learning to Learn (L2L), 
  a 12 CATS point unit, with around 740 students. At this stage L2L consisted of 
  a number of profiling tools, written in Toolbook, the University of 
  Lincolnshire and Humberside’s (ULH) own software for assessing IT skills and a 
  range of key skills delivered by print based open learning materials (1).</p> 
  
  <p>Some of the main findings of the L2L pilot included the following: </p> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>different interfaces and access points on the desktop for the components 
    of L2L caused confusion for some students 
    <li>some students thought that the name Learning to Learn was patronising 
    (‘they already knew how to learn’) 
    <li>some students wanted automated assessment on demand and the addition of 
    self diagnostic tests for IT skills 
    <li>the tutors wanted detailed tutor guides to support the delivery of L2L 
    <li>some tutors had difficulty in getting additional copies of the print 
    based learning materials. </li></ul>
	
  <h2>The Effective Learning Programme</h2>
  
<p>  The above findings led to a number of  changes. The first was to change the name from L2L to the Effective Learning  Programme (ELP). ELP was also developed further to fit in with the 
  University’s modular scheme and is now a 24 CATS point unit with eight 
  modules. (See the Appendix for more details on the structure of ELP.) 
  <p>To fit this structure, a new range of learning materials was required, with 
  detailed tutor guides. A common user interface was also needed so that 
  students could access ELP on any of ULH’s four campus. This interface also 
  needed to provide networked learner support. </p>
  
  <h3>Networked Learner Support</h3>
  
<p>  A computer based networked learner support system would need to provide the following, all within one interface, readily accessible on any of ULH’s campuses:</p> 

  <ul>
    <li>profiling tools 
    <li>self-diagnostic tests 
    <li>automated assessment 
    <li>feedback to the student 
    <li>feedback for the tutor 
    <li>information on ELP 
    <li>electronic materials delivery </li>
	</ul>
	
  <p>The development of L2L started in 1993; by 1996 the outcomes from the L2L 
  pilots had lead to the development of ELP. During these three years the World 
  Wide Web had come to the fore. Software is now available to dynamically link 
  databases to web browsers. This and other software developments now enable web 
  browsers to act more like intelligent interfaces. These developments have 
  meant that both industry and education have begun to change the way they use 
  technology for learning and communication. BP have produced a report, 
  ‘Technology for Learning’(2) giving us a vision of what the future learning 
  environment could be like. The future role of technology in providing the 
  learner with easy access to a wide range of information is highlighted by 
  JISC: the Joint Information Systems Committee (3). One of the key issues JISC 
  raises is the need to establish common user interfaces and standards for 
  information access for a wide range of learners. The developments in software 
  for the web are enabling these visions to become a reality. It was in July 
  1996 that ULH decided to use this web software to pilot a Networked Learning 
  Support Intranet (NLSI) to support the delivery of ELP. </p>
  
  <h3>Development of the Networked Learning Support Intranet</h3>
  
 <p> To develop the  NLSI a number of organizational and strategic issues had to be addressed. 
  These are briefly discussed below.</p> 
  
  <p><i><b>Links to ULH’s Student Management System</b></i> <br>Developing a 
  link to the Student Management System (SMS) was key. SMS holds the information 
  on all students registered on ULH’s programmes of study. By gaining access to 
  SMS the NLSI would enable tutors to : </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>create and manage student groups </li>
    <li>search for students </li>
    <li>monitor how students were using the NLSI</li> 
    <li>update each student’s assessment record. </li></ul>
	
  <p>However, there were a number of problems getting access to SMS. SMS is 
  managed by the Registrar and access is restricted for security reasons. Yet 
  for the NLSI to be effective we needed an up-to date record of SMS, otherwise 
  the tutor could not manage the student groups in ELP. After long negotiations 
  with the Registrar we were allowed read only access. </p>
  
  <p><i><b>Developing web based profiling and assessment tools</b></i> <br>ULH 
  is also in the process of re-developing the profiling tools, self diagnostic 
  tests and the automated assessment (used in L2L) so that they can be delivered 
  and supported via a web browser. One of the profiling tools, Approaches to 
  Study, has been converted and was used by students in the second semester. </p>
  
  <p><i><b>Software standards</b></i> <br>This raises another issue: the 
  standardization of software. In 1993 ULH decided that the software package 
  that it would use for most of its computer based learning would be written in 
  Toolbook. At the time of writing, the software that enables Toolbook to run in 
  a web browser does not track what students are doing. Tracking students is a 
  key requirement for the feedback in ELP. So we had to make the decision to do 
  the re-development so that the profiling tools could run and be monitored in a 
  web browser. It is interesting to note that the work done on study skills for 
  a Macintosh platform, by Entwistle at the University of Edinbrough (4) is also 
  being developed to work within a web browser. </p>
  
  <p><i><b>Monitoring application usage within the NLSI</b></i> <br>All the 
  activities that are required to be carried out by students, within the NLSI, 
  are monitored and the resulting information sent to central databases. Because 
  students are continually working within ELP these databases are always 
  changing. This means that the NLSI is dynamic - the web pages are actually 
  made up from the information within these databases. When a user logs on the 
  system identifies the type of user and then searches the appropriate 
  databases. This information is then sent to the web browser and pages are 
  created. Features like graphics, headings, information on layout are also 
  stored in a database and inserted into the web pages when required. </p>
  
  <p><i><b>Achieving database integration - software choices</b></i> <br>Another 
  key issue is what type of software do we use to integrate these databases into 
  the NLSI? At the time of the development phase of NLSI (July 1996) only one 
  piece of software seemed capable of doing all the things outlined in the above 
  paragraph: ‘Cold Fusion’. However, since then it appears that Microsoft has 
  taken a serious look at linking web browsers dynamically to databases. So at 
  the moment ULH is monitoring what Microsoft is doing. </p>
  
  <p>Universities like ULH use a range of databases to manage their 
  institutions. Access to these databases is going to be crucial if we are to 
  provide effective NLSI systems that will facilitate the learning process, both 
  for the tutor and the student. </p>
  <h3>Electronic materials delivery</h3>
  
<p>  Because of the amount of print based  learning material associated with ELP and the difficulty some tutors had in getting materials to students, in the L2L pilots, it was decided to make 
  materials available electronically via the NLSI. This turned out to be a very 
  simple thing to do. Using a piece of software called ‘Acrobat’ we were able to 
  make the print based learning materials available electronically. This enables 
  the tutor to print off what they require. It is worth noting that this system 
  is designed for small print runs, to print one or two copies of student guides 
  or to reproduce handouts. What tutors have found most useful is the ability to 
  scan the available materials on screen, and decide if it is suitable for their 
  students. </p>
  
  <p>One of the key issues in making learning materials available electronically 
  is the development of just in time printing (JIT). At the moment ULH does not 
  have large print run facilities on each campus so JIT is not really possible 
  on a large scale. So we still need to order large print runs from a central 
  unit or from outside ULH. We are, however, looking at JIT for each of the 
  campuses.  </p>
  
  <h2>Staff roles</h2>
  
  <p>ELP has been developed so that it is delivered and  supported by: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>weekly tutorials </li>
    <li>print-based open learning materials </li>
    <li>self diagnostic tests (paper based and computer based) </li>
    <li>profiling tools </li>
    <li>IT assessments on request </li>
    <li>the NLSI </li>
    <li>Learning Support staff </li>
    <li>other students. </li>
	</ul>
	
  <p>This delivery and support structure provides what MacFarlane (5) would call 
  an ISLE: an intensely supported learning environment. This learning 
  environment is structured to develop independence in learning. The ISLE has 
  had a significant effect on the roles of students, tutors, and Learning 
  Support staff. The changes in these staff roles have initiated a heated 
  debate, particularly in the role of Learning Support. These new staff roles 
  cover a number of areas. To provide the ISLE for ELP a department like 
  Learning Support should be able to provide the following: </p>
  
   <ul>
    <li>the development of technology for learning - the NLSI and its component 
    parts </li>
    <li>materials development and production for ELP </li>
    <li>delivering ELP </li>
    <li>supporting ELP in Learning Support centres. </li>
	</ul>
	
  <p>Solutions will have to be found to the above if Learning Support are to be 
  actively involved in the development of systems like the NLSI and the delivery 
  and support of learning and study skills across the University. Both Fielden 
  (6) and Ford (7) outline similar changes in the student’s learning environment 
  and the need for new staff roles within departments like Learning Support to 
  effect these changes. The changes in Learning Support staff roles are 
  discussed below. </p>
  
  <h3>The development of technology for learning - the NLSI and its component 
  parts</h3>
  
 <p> When we look at centralised administrative university computer 
  departments these usually cover two main areas: </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Administrative Computing, this covers areas like financial control and 
    student record keeping. </li>
    <li>Computing and Network Services (CNS), this usually provides and supports 
    the academic networks. </li>
	</ul>
	
  <p>These departments have little day to day contact with students. To develop 
  ELP, and the NLSI to support it, we needed software developers with some 
  knowledge of how students interact in the learning environment of computing 
  centres. The IT staff in Learning Support have day to day contact with 
  students in computing centres. They understand the student population, from 
  those that are techno-phobic to those that can hack into the University’s 
  networks! At ULH these IT staff also have the appropriate set of software 
  development skills. They were ideally suited to develop the software for ELP. 
  With this basic understanding of how students interact with their learning 
  environment the IT staff were able to develop user-friendly interfaces for the 
  profiling tools and a simple navigation system for the NLSI. With skills like 
  these Learning Support are in an ideal position to take on a central 
  development role - working with the academic community and central computer 
  departments to develop systems and software that will help both tutors and 
  students to both facilitate and manage the learning processes. </p>
  <p>Learning Support are also in an ideal position to provide the 
  administration functions required for NLSI and to maintain and update its 
  component parts - like the profiling tools and the automated assessment 
  facility. This updating can be done using the valuable feedback that will be 
  gained form working on a daily basis with both staff and students working 
  within ELP. </p>
  <p>If Learning Support is to take a significant role in the development of 
  systems like the NLSI then new roles within Learning Support need to be 
  defined and closer working links with other central computer and information 
  departments need to be made. </p>
  
  <h3>Materials development and production</h3>
  
<p>  <i><b>Development of IT skills for ELP</b></i> <br>If we are to provide an ISLE where students have a choice  as to when, where and how they study then the way the curriculum is delivered 
  needs to change. The lecture is no longer suitable, or effective as the major 
  delivery mode (5). An example of the effective use of open learning materials 
  was when ULH decided to convert its IT delivery from lectures to open access. 
  Early in 1992 ULH recognised it had a problem delivering and supporting basic 
  IT skills to large numbers of students. Students were arriving at ULH with a 
  wide range of abilities, from those who treated the mouse like a remote 
  control to those who had been word-processing and working in a Windows 
  environment for a number of years. It was difficult to work with groups of 
  students with this range of skills. ULH decided to develop open learning 
  materials so that students could work in their own time and at their own pace. 
  ULH now has wide range of open learning materials for developing IT skills. 
  These are supported by self-diagnostic tests that students can access via the 
  network, with automated assessment on request. Some of these IT materials have 
  been integrated into ELP and are available for selection by the ELP tutors. </p>
  
  <p>The IT skills materials were developed by a team in Learning Support in 
  consultation with academic staff. The academic staff commented on the 
  structure and the content of the IT manuals and on the content of the 
  automated assessment. The team in Learning Support consists of an editor, 
  authors and a desk top publisher. These duties are carried out as part of 
  their normal daily routine within Learning Support. The funding for these 
  posts was transferred from the academic departments, when there was no further 
  requirement for academic input to basic IT skills development. </p>
  
  <p><i><b>Other skills modules for ELP</b></i> <br>Other open learning 
  materials were also developed or brought in for the other modules within ELP. 
  Each was structured so that students would be able to work through them within 
  a three week period and each has a tutor guide to help ELP tutors integrate 
  the skills in ELP into their subject areas. These modules and the tutor guides 
  were developed by both academic and Learning Support staff.  </p>
  
  <p><i><b>Materials production and delivery</b></i> <br>ELP is resource based 
  learning (RBL). The main resources for ELP are print and computer based, with 
  weekly tutorial support. With large numbers of students doing ELP there was 
  the problem of getting the print based learning materials to students at the 
  start of the first semester in 1996. Any RBL that involves large numbers of 
  students requires a very competent person to manage the production and 
  delivery of the print-based learning material, together with reliable systems 
  and procedures. So ULH seconded a member of staff from Learning Support to be 
  the ‘Print Production Manager’ for ELP. One of her two main functions was to 
  act as managing editor for the materials. This involved managing and editing 
  the:  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>IT manuals, ‘Getting Started with Word 6’ and ‘Getting Started with 
    Windows 95’ </li>
    <li>tutor guides for all the skills materials. </li>
	</ul>
	
  <p>The above, relatively short, list would have been significantly longer if 
  ULH had not looked around to see what other skills materials were available. 
  After evaluating a wide range of skills materials that had been produced by 
  the private sector and other universities ULH decided to use the materials 
  that DeMontfort had produced. All ULH had to do then was to produce the tutor 
  guides that would integrate the DeMontfort material into ELP. This has cut 
  down the development costs significantly and helped to address the ‘not 
  invented here’ syndrome.</p> 
  <p>The other main role of the Print Production Manager was that of print 
  buyer. She had to contact all the schools to determine how many students would 
  be studying ELP and what skills materials they would be using. To pay for all 
  these materials the schools had their budgets top-sliced and a central budget 
  was set up so that all the materials could be bulk purchased. The following is 
  an outline of what was ordered to support ELP in 1996: </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>4,000 IT guides, including Getting Started with: Word, Windows (3.1 and 
    95), Excel and SPSS </li>
    <li>8,000 student guides from DeMontfort covering twelve different skills. </li>
    <li>50 ELP tutor packs. </li>
	</ul>
	
  <p>The total budget for printing of the ELP materials was just over £23,000. </p>
  <p>The Print Production Manager’s final role was to ensure that all the ELP 
  materials were delivered to a central point at ULH and she distributed to the 
  various school offices. </p>
  <p>Some universities do not have a print production facility for RBL. It is 
  left to individuals to try and manage the production, printing and 
  distribution of print based learning materials. Gibbs (8) gives us a mythical 
  account of a lone lecturer’s attempt to convert her degree course to RBL. It 
  is well worth a read if you are considering converting any taught course to 
  RBL. </p>
  <p>If any university is to develop RBL then it will need to have in place a 
  learning materials print production facility. A department like Learning 
  Support is the ideal place for this. It has a major presence on each campus 
  and therefore should also be able to provide just in time print facilities and 
  print shops. </p>
  <h3>Delivering the Effective Learning Programme</h3>
  
 <p> If students are to develop  learning and study skills the best approach is to integrate these skills into 
  the student’s subject area. This will ensure that students do not learn skills 
  in isolation, but have the opportunity to practice and develop them within the 
  context of the core subject of their studies (9). With this integrated 
  approach, the skills that are required within the subject should be made 
  explicit to the students.</p> 
  
  <p>So what involvement, if any, should Learning Support have in the delivery 
  of ELP? The delivery and support of information retrieval skills is usually 
  seen as the responsibility of Learning Support. In some institutions so is the 
  delivery of basic IT skills. But what about presentation skills, group skills 
  etc? If the integration of any skills programme into the student’s programme 
  of study is the key to students developing these skills then how can Learning 
  Support play an active role in integrating these skills into the student’s 
  subject area? </p> 
  <p>The current practice, at ULH, is for ELP to be delivered by the schools. 
  ULH adopted this policy for two reasons. The first is the notion of ownership. 
  ELP represents 20% of the curriculum at level one. All schools that are part 
  of ULH’s modular programme get the same funding to deliver ELP units as they 
  do to deliver their subject units. With this approach schools get the funding 
  to deliver ELP and therefore they should take ownership of ELP and integrate 
  it into their subject area. </p> 
  <p>The second reason for giving ELP to schools is the Gibbs (9) argument. 
  Integrating skills into the subject area should be done by tutors that have 
  the subject knowledge. Therefore the ideal person to deliver ELP is the tutor 
  in the student’s subject area. </p> 
  <p>However, there is a viable alternative : the Learning Advisor. At ULH 
  Learning Advisors are part funded by the subject areas and are situated in 
  Learning Support. This is based on the model that Fielden (6) outlines in his 
  report on ‘Supporting Expansion.’ At the time of writing, Learning Support at 
  ULH is in the middle of restructuring its department so that it will have 
  Learning Advisors in each subject area. Learning Support does, however, 
  already have one Learning Advisor working in languages. This Learning Advisor 
  attends the subject’s course committees, is an active member of the subject’s 
  academic community and works closely with language students at all levels of 
  study and she runs the ELP tutorials. This is a good example of how Learning 
  Support can work closely with the academic community in delivering an 
  integrated approach to the development of students’ learning and study skills. </p> 

  <p>Creating the Learning Advisor post involved the Director of Learning 
  Support spending a significant amount of his time talking to the deans to 
  ensure that funds were made available from each subject area. </p>
  
  <h3>Supporting ELP</h3>
  
<p>  <i><b>Help Desks</b></i> <br>The main aim of ELP is to 
  develop independent life-long learners. So there should be little demand made 
  on the help-desks by ELP students. The enquiries the help-desk staff get from 
  ELP students cover two main areas, one is the use of the IT materials. If a 
  ELP student has a problem with IT then he or she is guided to the most 
  appropriate IT materials. The other enquiries cover the use of the computer 
  software for ELP. All help-desk staff are NLSI administrators and have had 
  experience of all the ELP software on the staff development programmes that 
  were run for all Learning Support staff. So if a student, or a member of 
  staff, has a problem with any of the ELP software the people on the help-desks 
  will be able to assist them.</p> 
  
  <p>At ULH we are currently attempting to re-define the functions of the 
  help-desk. To do this we are looking at the student as a learner. To encourage 
  students to become independent lifelong learners the way most help-desk staff 
  interact with students needs to change. Staff on help desks like helping 
  students, they sometimes do the student’s work for them! Many students expect 
  to be helped in this way so students’ expectations will also need to change. 
  To help re-define the functions of the help-desks Learning Support are running 
  a series of workshops. It is hoped that by the end of these Learning Support 
  will have defined a different role, and perhaps even a different name, for the 
  help-desk! </p> 
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  
<p>  The development of the ELP and the NLSI has shown us that 
  technology can not only deliver content: it can also help both tutors and 
  students manage the learning process. If a system like the NLSI is to be 
  effective then universities like ULH must give secured access to databases 
  held within central departments like Registry.</p>
   
  <p>We must, however, be aware that technology can not do everything that a 
  student requires. The role of tutor or facilitator is vital if students are to 
  develop and integrate key skills into their programme of study and into their 
  lives beyond university. Developments like ELP also mean significant changes 
  in staff roles, particularly in departments like Learning Support. If a 
  Learning Support department wants to take a proactive role in changing the way 
  a university delivers and supports the curriculum then it needs to consider 
  changing both the structure of Learning Support and staff roles. These changes 
  will most likely have to be made within the current budgetary constraints of 
  most Learning Support departments.

  <h1>Appendix - The Effective Learning Programme - its structure</h1>
  
<p>  ELP runs  over the two semesters at level one. It helps students to develop learning and 
  study skills. It is designed to build on the wide range of skills that 
  students bring with them to university. </p>
  
  <h2>Aims of the Effective Learning Programme</h2>
<p>  Some of the aims include:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li>helping students to 'acclimatise' quickly to the learning environment of 
    the University </li>
    <li>enabling students to become more effective learners. This means that 
    students should be able to get the most out of their studies and will be 
    more likely to succeed at university </li>
    <li>equipping students with a range of skills they will need to complete 
    their studies, and which should make students more employable. </li></ul>
	
  <h2>Structure</h2>
  
<p>  The ELP is a double-semester unit which is taken during the 
  first year of study. It is made up of eight equal modules. Four of these 
  modules (A, B, C and D) will be taken by all students taking the ELP, and are 
  termed 'core modules'. The other four modules concentrate on skills which are 
  particularly relevant to the subjects each student is studying. These are 
  termed 'selected modules' (see Figure 1: note that you start from the bottom 
  of the figure). </p>

<div><br>  Figure 1</div>

  <h2>Content of the core modules</h2>
  
  <p>The content of the core modules is as  follows:</p> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>Module A - <i><b>Introduction to the Effective Learning 
    Programme</b></i>: including the introduction to IT (using IT open learning 
    guides,<i> Getting Started with Windows </i>and <i>Getting Started with 
    Word</i>) and how to use open learning materials </li>
    <li>Module B - <i><b>Learning Styles</b></i>: including learning style 
    profiling, action planning and reflection </li>
    <li>Module C - <i><b>Information Retrieval</b></i><b>: </b>including an 
    information retrieval exercise, input on plagiarism and referencing, and the 
    completion of the two IT<i> </i>guides from module A </li>
    <li>Module D - <i><b>Study Skills</b></i>: including an independence in 
    learning inventory, an Approaches to Study survey and action planning. 
  </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>The selected modules</h2>
  <p>The selected modules for most ELP students are:</p> 
  <ul>
    <li><i>Time Management</i> 
    <li><i>Group Skills</i> 
    <li><i>Presentation Skills</i> 
    <li><i>Essay Writing OR Report Writing.</i> </li></ul>
  <h2>Dates for completion of each of the modules</h2>
  
<p>  Core module A is taken  first and core module D should be taken at the start of the second semester, 
  all the others can be taken in any order. This order will be determined in the 
  ELP tutor group. Students have an important role to play in the selection of 
  this order. To do this they need to know when their subject areas will require 
  the skills that they need developing in the ELP. For example, if a student is 
  doing Essay Writing as an ELP module they will need to know when the first 
  essay is to be handed in. Students will need to inform their ELP tutor of this 
  date.</p> 
  
  <h2>Assessment</h2>
  
<p>  Assessment is associated with each of the eight modules 
  over the two semesters. Some modules have several parts to their assessment, 
  each of which must be passed to gain an overall pass for that module. These 
  assessments will be spaced throughout the two semesters and are an integral 
  part of the ELP tutorial groups. So students must attend regularly to avoid 
  missing assessments. All eight module assessments must be passed to gain an 
  overall pass for the unit. A variety of different types of assessment are used 
  on the ELP. These range from computerised assessments for the IT modules, to 
  the writing of essays/reports and the successful completion of group tasks. 
  Once ELP tutor groups have resolved their programme, tutors list the 
  assessments and the order that they will be taken in. </p>
  
  <h2>Students' ELP portfolio</h2>
  
<p>  Tutors will keep a record of students’ 
  performance, using the ELP Intranet, in all the module assessments. It is also 
  important that students keep their own records of work done for the ELP. This 
  includes task and assessment sheets, handouts and all study guides. This 
  material should be kept in a ring binder, forming an ELP portfolio. The 
  portfolio has two purposes:</p> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>to act as a record of the work the student has done, results of 
    profiling etc. for future reference </li>
    <li>to provide evidence of attainment/effort which may be required for 
    subject exam boards in the case of a marginal result for the overall 
    assessment of the ELP unit. </li></ul>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
 <p> "(O)ur concepts of place/space and time" (Steele, 1996, 
  p263) are affected, and will increasingly be affected, by the convergence of 
  Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and their capacity to reduce 
  geographical as well as personal remoteness. This potential is increasingly 
  recognised in a wide spectrum of organisations, not least in Higher Education 
  (Barker, 1994; Hawkridge, 1996). It presents particular opportunities to 
  distance education institutions (Dede, 1996) such as the Open University (OU) 
  and not least to the Open University Business School (OUBS). The latter is 
  concerned with the professional development of managers up to and including 
  Master of Business Administration (MBA) level over much of Western Europe and 
  increasingly in other parts of the world, through multi-media, supported 
  distance learning. 
  <p>Our particular concern in this paper is with the potential of one aspect of 
  ICTs - Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) which we can here define broadly 
  as "any communication patterns mediated through the computer" (Metz 1994, p 
  32), although according to context we often use it more narrowly to mean 
  Computer Mediated Conferencing. The computer conferencing system with which we 
  worked involved a server (a single device which acts as a central hub to the 
  conferencing network) and a series of nodes (usually referred to as clients) 
  from which the system may be accessed. The users we describe were logging in 
  from home computers, using modems and telephone lines, to a central server, 
  based in Milton Keynes, England. 
  <p>Others have written about the successful use of CMC in supporting 
  professional development in their own professional environments: for instance, 
  Leach (1996) on a school-based initial teacher education program, Prendergast 
  (1996, 1997) on the delivery of supervisory skills training in a police force, 
  and de Vries et al (1995) on staff development in a University. The current 
  paper is concerned more narrowly with the <i>training </i>required for 
  effective use of CMC for on-line communication, networking and teaching in the 
  context of the OUBS, although the approach has a wider and more general 
  application. The paper contends that such training needs to be based on a 
  learner-centred approach which addresses likely barriers to learning in the 
  context of CMC and which emphasises a progression from the acquisition of 
  basic skills through to the development of deeper insight into the potential 
  of CMC as a teaching and communication medium. The approach is informed by a 
  five stage model developed specifically for this purpose.</p> 
  <h3>The training gap</h3>
  
  <p>Various writers have indicated potential barriers to 
  learning inherent in the use of ICTs, such as attitudinal problems (Droll, 
  1996 p.100; Wild, 1996 p136; Bandlow (1996) p162), and the need to cope with 
  hardware and software demands (Murphy et al 1996; Hillman et al, 1994). 
  Hillman et al (op.cit.) note that, beyond those who have difficulties with the 
  basic delivery system, "(t)he inability to achieve learner-interface 
  interaction successfully can also be a significant problem for those 
  comfortable with technology yet unfamiliar with the specific communication 
  protocols required to interact with the tools to accomplish a desired task" . 
  Not only can cost to the student in terms of hardware and actual and perceived 
  line charge costs be a deterrent, but also the fallibility of connections 
  (Ribold, 1996, p96). The concentration on a particular learning approach may 
  be a barrier for some students, if it runs contrary to their own preferred 
  approach. There is also a requirement to use study time in new ways, given 
  that "(a)ccessing and manipulating information electronically seems to 'eat' 
  time at a rate we are not aware of and so the personal costs will be more than 
  financial, with the less technologically skilledand/or inclined doubly 
  disadvantaged." (Davison, op.cit, p 151). But also, crucially, there is a need 
  to master a new and potentially culturally strange means of communication: 
  "CMC is unique in that it is perhaps the only medium...(where) its users also, 
  crucially, there is a need to master a new and potentially culturally strange 
  means of change the very nature of communication" (Metz 1994 p47). The act of 
  communicating through CMC has given birth to its own neologism - "saywriting" 
  (Mason 1992) with all that this implies in terms of learning new entry skills, 
  not the least of which is presumably the ability to compose and communicate 
  easily via a keyboard (Bandlow op cit p163). Whereas familiarity with the 
  basic technology and its use for tasks such as word processing seems now to be 
  more widespread, at least in an educational setting (Lienard, 1995; von 
  Pruemmer and Rossie, 1996), this does not yet extend to CMC, as our own 
  investigations have confirmed. The implication is that a training gap exists 
  that needs to be filled if the potential for CMC use is to be realised. We 
  thus readily concur with Hillman et al's (op cit) plea for "a comprehensive 
  learning program designed to ensure at least minimum competency of 
  learner-interface interaction".</p> 
  <h3>Background to the construction of the Training</h3>
  
  <p>In 1994, the decision 
  was taken to produce a new purpose-designed and integrated Foundation Course 
  for the Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree offered by the Open 
  University Business School (OUBS). This course was called B800, <i>Foundation 
  of Senior Management</i>. Early in the production process, the Course Team 
  chose to integrate the educational, networking, communication and 
  administrative opportunities offered by computer conferencing into the course 
  design. In May 1995, it was decided that the software platform to be used 
  would be <i>FirstClass</i><sup>TM</sup>. At this time, a very small team of 
  interested individuals was set up, with two of the authors of this paper as 
  joint Chair, to design a training programme for the part-time tutors who would 
  be recruited to teach B800. The aim was to ensure an adequate level of 
  competence to teach through this medium by the time the course started in 
  February 1996.</p> 
  <p>We developed our understanding of the opportunities and the way in which 
  management students use computer conferencing through participant observation, 
  content analysis and focus groups of users of management conferences on the OU 
  system in use (<i>CoSy</i>) from 1990 to 1995. A simple model of use was built 
  from this research. The computer conferences from which this model were 
  derived were provided as additional, optional and complementary to more 
  traditional distance learning components such as text, video and face to face 
  group work and show unstructured or "natural" use (Nixon and Salmon 1966)</p> 
  <center>
  <h4>Model of Computer Mediated Conferencing Use - Figure 1</h4><img 
  alt="Figure 1" height=456 src="allfig1.gif" width=584></center>
  
  <h3>Stage 1 ACCESS</h3>
  
 <p> At the first stage of CMC use, the learner needs 
  information and technical support to get "on-line", and motivation to 
  undertake the time and effort involved. High motivation is a prime factor at 
  this stage in encouraging participants to tackle the technical aspects, 
  especially if they are dialling in through remote sites. Access to support 
  needs to be available at the times at which the learner is likely to be 
  struggling to get on-line on his or her <i>own</i>. The problem can be 
  overcome by providing continuing encouragement and support. This stage can be 
  considered to be over at the point at which the learner posts his or her first 
  message.</p> 
  <center>
  <h4>Figure 2 - Level 1 Access &amp; Motivation in the On Line 
  Training</h4><img alt="Figure 2" height=219 src="allfig2.gif" 
  width=450></center>
  
  <p>Level 1 of the Training programme was intended to provide access to 
  <i>FirstClass</i><sup>TM</sup> and the training programme and motivation to 
  the <i>tutors in training</i> to continue. It included an "Arrivals" 
  conference where they were invited to post their first messages. 187 first 
  messages were posted there between November 1995 and 18 March 1996. The 
  authors of this paper, as the training programme leaders, e-mailed individual 
  welcomes and directional messages to all new "arrivals" on line. The <i>tutors 
  in training</i> were also at this stage given instructions on how to post 
  their resumes, short biographies available to all users of 
  <i>FirstClass</i><sup>TM</sup>.</p>
   
  <p>All participants were also asked to visit a "Reflections" conference before 
  moving on to level 2. The "Reflections" conference aimed directly to test the 
  achievement of the objectives of level 1 as well as to determine the amount of 
  time the training was taking. Access to the conferencing system was rated 
  highly by participants. On a possible scale of 1(-) to 10(+), there was a mean 
  of 6.94, with 47% of <i>tutors in training</i> rating access as 9 or 10, and 
  only 5 (6%) scoring under 5. The attempts to make <i>tutors in training</i> 
  feel valued and welcome in the virtual environment were successful, with a 
  mean score of 8.74 with 54% scoring 9 or 10.</p> 
  <p>At this stage too, motivation was high. 38% of <i>tutors in training</i> 
  reported that they felt highly motivated to continue with only 7% not 
  motivated. Similarly, very positive feelings were reported both about the 
  training programme (a mean score of 7.84) and only slightly less about using 
  this medium for teaching on the course (7.39).</p> 
  
  <h3>Off Line Resources</h3>
<p>  Questions were also asked at this level about the 
  documentation that had been provided to support the <i>tutors in training</i> 
  and what other training aids they would have liked. The documentation was less 
  well received with a mean score of 5.58 with 10% of the <i>tutors in 
  training</i> unhappy with it and only 18% very happy. The main complaint was 
  not about the existence of documentation but about its length, lack of direct 
  compatibility with the 5 levels of the training programme and lack of examples 
  of what would be presented on screen at key stages.</p> 
  <p>At this point at the end of level 1, trainees reported an average of 105 
  minutes spent off line on reading and preparing to train, and 67 minutes on 
  line. However, the off-line time included, in some cases an inordinate amount 
  of time spent on getting and setting up appropriate equipment.</p> 
  <h3>Stage 2 INDUCTION AND SOCIALISATION</h3>
  <p>Every grouping of people develops 
  its own culture - formal and informal rules, norms of behaviour, ways of 
  operating and of sanctioning those who fail to understand or conform. Help 
  with "Netiquette" was provided in the tutor training conferences by examples 
  and practical work on line.</p> 
  <p>Those who are initially reluctant to commit themselves fully to public 
  participation in conferencing can be encouraged as a first step to read and 
  enjoy others' contributions to the conferences for a short while, before 
  taking the plunge and posting their own messages. This is known as "lurking". 
  Some conference leaders become annoyed with lurkers but it appears to be a 
  natural and normal part of CMC socialisation and should therefore be 
  encouraged for a while as a first step. It is also important to be tolerant of 
  "chat" conferences and socialising (McCreary 1989). At the point of feeling 
  "at home" with the culture, and reasonably comfortable with the technology, 
  the learner is free to move on.</p> 
  <center>
  <h4>Figure 3 - Level 2 of the B800 tutor training desktop</h4><img 
  alt="Figure 3" height=250 src="allfig3.gif" width=450></center>
  
  <h3>Level 2 - Induction</h3>
 <p> Level 2 was intended to provide basic software 
  skills in using <i>FirstClass</i><sup>TM</sup>, increasing feelings of 
  confidence and comfort in working with others through the CMC medium and the 
  opportunity to find others with similar interests. The feedback collected in 
  the "Reflections" conference, indicated that <i>tutors in training</i> felt 
  they had acquired basic technical skills at this level (mean score of 7.49), 
  and were increasing in confidence (mean of 7.08).</p> 
  <h3>Stage 3 SEEKING INFORMATION, FINDING NEW PATHWAYS</h3>
  <p>The acceptability of 
  a communication medium to a user is likely to be directly related to the 
  "richness" of the information it conveys. However, at this stage, the learner 
  looks to leaders to provide direction through the mass of data and 
  encouragement to start using the most relevant material. The support skills 
  related to the task focus of the group became important for conference 
  leaders, as well as taking part in the processes of discovery. Information 
  flows freely - the "cost" of responding is low in terms of time and effort and 
  altruism grows quickly (Sproull and Kiesler 1991).</p> 
  <h3>Level 3 - Information Giving and Receiving</h3>
  <center>
  <h4>Figure 4- Level 3 of the Tutor Training</h4><img alt="Figure 4" height=306 
  src="allfig4.gif" width=400></center>
  
  <p>At level 3 of the tutor training, additional skills conferences or 
  "workshops" developed participants' ability to work with the software at this 
  level. In addition, on line seminars and workshops were set up to correspond 
  with the four main disciplines of B800, i.e. <i>Managing People</i>, 
  <i>Finance &amp; Information</i>, <i>Organisations &amp; Change</i> and 
  <i>Marketing</i>. The model suggested that after the basic skills and 
  confidence of working on line was acquired, <i>tutors in training </i>would be 
  interested in considering and discussing the content of the blocks of the 
  course that were relevant to them and this proved to be true. They felt that 
  this level of the programme had fulfilled the objectives for them, with a mean 
  score of over 7 on each of the objectives.</p> 
  <p>At this level, the participants began to be acutely aware of who was 
  contributing and participating and who was not. Many of the qualitative 
  comments in the "Reflections" conference concerned these aspects.</p>
  
  <h3>Stage 4 INTERACTION</h3>
  
  <p>At this stage the participants start to interact 
  with each other, often in highly exposed and participative ways. The act of 
  formulating and writing down an idea or understanding and reading and 
  responding to peers is a most important cognitive skill . Once this begins, it 
  has its own momentum and power. Collaborative learning can be seen to happen 
  in very visible and often exciting ways (McConnell 1994). At this stage, very 
  active learning, especially widening and appreciation of differing 
  perspectives and understanding of application of concepts and theories happens 
  very obviously as conferences unfold and develop.</p> 
  
  <p>The learner needs enabling tutors to stimulate conferences, summarise wide 
  ranging views, provide new topic areas where discussions and interactions go 
  off track, and stimulate fresh strands, themes and approaches. Tutoring skills 
  related to group-building and maintenance become important. The tutor 
  typically undertakes "weaving" the student contributions together, e.g. 
  collecting up statements and relating them to concepts and theories and 
  enabling development through discussion and development.</p>
   
  <p>Enabling participants to get through to this stage often brings great 
  rewards. Ideas often emerge and provoke responses of interest and vitality and 
  these are shaped in a dynamic way. Regardless of the designated subject, it is 
  common for participants to reflect and discuss how they are networking and to 
  demonstrate a form of "meta-learning" in a way that evaluates the technology 
  and its impact (Wellington 1995).</p> 
  
  <h3>Level 4 - Interaction</h3>
  <center>
  <h4>Figure 5- Level 4 of the Tutor Training</h4><img alt="Figure 5" height=234 
  src="allfig5.gif" width=423></center>
  
  <p>At level 4, the conferencing area was set up to discuss the functional 
  areas of tutoring through distance learning, e.g. correspondence teaching and 
  assignment marking, face to face tutorials and teaching on line. It attracted 
  a large number of positive qualitative comments, as the <i>tutors in 
  training</i> felt they were sharing with each other, and achieving new ideas 
  that had direct relevance and impact on their teaching. Each sub-conference 
  however very rapidly filled up, and since only the more confident felt able to 
  be selective in reading some message and not others, there were a number of 
  complaints about the volume of unread messages, indicated in 
  <i>FirstClass</i><sup>TM</sup> by red flag alongside the unread message. The 
  leaders of the conferences needed to log in often in order to summarise and 
  archive messages, and where this happened the conferences were more attractive 
  and better received. However, the level of engagements with each other, and 
  the obvious competence of the <i>tutors in training</i> by this stage in 
  <i>using</i> conferencing to share ideas was clear. In many cases, it appeared 
  to have become almost "second nature" and there were few complaints, and 
  perhaps this accounted for the fact that slightly fewer visited the 
  "Reflections" conference at this level.</p> 
  
  <h3>Stage 5 AUTONOMY</h3>
 <p> At this stage, the learner becomes responsible for 
  his or her own learning through the computer mediated opportunities and little 
  support beyond what is already available is necessary. Indeed, he or she may 
  resent interference and ask the leaders to withdraw and may indeed wish to 
  start conferences of their own. The role of the tutor when learners achieve 
  this kind of use is sometimes a difficult one to negotiate. They may be 
  accused of "gate crashing" on the learning processes and failing to understand 
  the power of the learning going on. The participants will often be confident 
  enough in the medium to confront a tutor when interventions seem unhelpful or 
  out of place. The participants may start to challenge the basis of the 
  conferences or system. They typically start to demand better access, faster 
  responses, more software. They may became extremely resistant to changes or 
  downtime on the system. At this stage, participants may find ways of producing 
  and dealing with humour and the more emotional aspects of writing and 
  interacting. The reflection involved in this is considerable and may impact on 
  other more usual day to day communications. At this point, the blurring 
  between the learning and teaching results not only in frequent changes of 
  roles, but lack of need to define roles.</p> 
  <h3>Level 5 -Autonomy &amp; Development</h3>
  <center>
  <h4>Figure 6 Level 5 of the Tutor Training</h4><img alt="Figure 6" height=299 
  src="allfig6.gif" width=451></center>
  
 <p> At this level, <i>tutors in 
  training</i> were introduced to the skills of creating and setting up their 
  own conferences, and they were given a practice area in which to do this. In 
  addition, they were invited to set up discussion conferences on topics of 
  their choice.</p> 
  <p>The final reflections conference again indicated very positive feelings 
  about the training at this stage - with an average score of 7 against most of 
  the questions. Only the question asking how they felt about using CMC for 
  working with their students attracted a slightly lower average score - 6.52, 
  probably because the setting up of their own conferences seemed a little 
  complicated than they might have thought and the start of the B800 course was 
  only days away!</p> 
  <h3>Evaluation of the Software by the Tutors at the end of their On Line 
  Training</h3>
 <p> At this stage of the training, the tutors answered an on-line 
  questionnaire about the use of the software and their participation, together 
  with questions about the use of CMC for management learning programmes. 
  <i>FirstClass</i><sup>TM</sup> scored highly with the <i>tutors in 
  training</i> in terms of consistency of icons and screen displays with 40 
  respondents giving scores 9 or 10, with a mean of 8.22. It was also considered 
  easy to use by most. Over 75% of the <i>tutors in training</i> reported 
  "active participation" in the on-line training programme. However, 53 
  respondents also pointed out the value of "passive" participation, i.e. 
  browsing or lurking. In addition, respondents were asked to rate the overall 
  training programme in terms of maintaining their interest. This scored a mean 
  of 7.3 , with 24 giving it a score of 9 or 10 and only 3 giving it less than 
  5. This suggests that a structured on-line programme, using 
  <i>FirstClass</i><sup>TM</sup>, is suitable for training purposes.</p> 
  <p>Trainees were also asked for any features of <i>FirstClass</i><sup>TM</sup> 
  that they felt had got in the way of their learning. The lack of an off-line 
  reader was mentioned typically by those who had used one for other 
  conferencing platforms. Worries about working on line and resultant telephone 
  costs were mentioned by many others. In total, throughout the 7 questionnaires 
  and reflections conferences, this issue was mentioned 158 time. We now (1997) 
  have an off-line reader.</p> 
  <h3>Phase Two of the On Line Tutor Training</h3>
  <p>From February 1997, all OU MBA 
  courses offered contact, support and administration on line for all MBA 
  students - approximately 3,500 registrations. B800 entered its second 
  presentation and the new compulsory follow-on course to B800, B820 <i>Strategy 
  </i>commenced. Each of the other eight MBA options ceased to use the OU's old 
  conferencing system, <i>CoSy</i>, as a CMC platform and moved to 
  <i>FirstClass</i><sup>TM</sup>. We were therefore faced with the need to train 
  a further cohort of tutors in <i>FirstClass</i><sup>TM</sup> and CMC.</p> 
  <h3>Amendments &amp; Improvements to the Second Presentation of the On Line 
  Tutor Training</h3>
  <p>The tutor training was designed again around the 5 stage 
  model, However, the supporting documentation had the minimum of text. Instead 
  it provided direct copies of screen displays and messages to assist with 
  off-line working and to provide signposts around the conferencing. We provided 
  a "lifebelt" icon at each stage of the training - with both on- line help and 
  an invitation to e-mail one individual if really "stuck". We emphasised styles 
  of communication on line, appropriate for management education, rather than 
  the narrower "Netiquette" conference used in the first presentation. We 
  highlighted the skills associated with creating, setting up and managing 
  conferences much more, and brought this forward to level 3.</p> 
  <p>At level 3, tutors were requested to check that they had acquired all the 
  <i>FirstClass</i><sup>TM</sup> skills necessary before they moved onto levels 
  4 and 5 where they discussed and planned how to use CMC for teaching on their 
  courses. We hoped that by taking this approach we would reduce the number of 
  administrative and access problems after the courses started and move the 
  emphasis further up the 5 stage model towards interaction for academic and 
  teaching purposes. We simplified the "nesting" of conferences wherever 
  possible to reduce trainees becoming "lost" in the hierarchies of 
  sub-conferences. Again, we provided a "Reflections" conference at each level 
  to encourage elicitation and sharing of learning and an exit questionnaire at 
  the last level, 5, which directly tested the success of the model, and sought 
  to expand and develop our understandings of it.</p> 
  <h3>Success of the Second Presentation of the Tutor Training</h3>
  <p>106 tutors 
  went through the training between October 1996 and February 1997. A greater 
  percentage completed the training compared to the first presentation in 95/6 
  (92% compared with 60%) and the number of small changes described above had a 
  major impact on the number of difficulties and problems expressed. A 
  non-interactive form of the training has now been placed on all tutors' 
  desktops for late arrivals and revision purposes.</p> 
  
  <h3>Conclusions</h3>
  <p>This paper has outlined a 5-stage model for the 
  development of competence in on-line computer conferencing. The model was 
  tested in an action-research setting - during two on-line training programme 
  for a cohorts of Open University Business School MBA tutors. Results showed 
  that the model-based training programme was effective in enabling participants 
  progressively to develop skills in the use of CMC. The on-line training 
  programme was found to be cost effective against face-to-face training.</p> 
  <p>Working with the 5 stage model as a basis, the experience of running the 
  training demonstrated that good, quick access on line and toleration of 
  "lurking" and social interaction prior to commencing with learning and course 
  based interaction courses was a key feature. In the second "run" of the on 
  line training, the availability on line of technical and motivational help 
  from a responsive individual was seen as an essential follow up to the 
  telephone helpline provided for initial access and set up problems.</p> 
  <p>The study suggests that the medium offers new opportunities for the 
  development of management teachers on-line. A most notable outcome from the 
  training has been that a very large percentage of the MBA tutors interact on 
  line with each other and staff of the OUBS in addition to their students, thus 
  forming a viable and creative on line distance teaching community. In this 
  sense, we feel that training on line fills the gap in preparing tutors to 
  teach through CMC and enables the OUBS to focus on fully developing on line 
  teaching for students as a viable and integrated aspect of supported distance 
  learning for managers.</p>

  <h3>Appendix 1</h3>
  <h4>Aims and objectives </h4>
  
  <p>(Extract from B800T Manual 95/6) The overall 
  purpose of the Training Programme is, of course, to prepare you for using CMC 
  to support your students on B800. More specifically, the aims of the Programme 
  are:</p> 
  <blockquote>1. To enable you to learn relevant 
    <i>FirstClass</i><sup>TM</sup> commands and facilities quickly and easily. 
    <p>2. To ensure that you feel comfortable interacting with others on-line by 
    familiarising you with the social codes associated with CMC. 
    <p>3. To highlight the pedagogic opportunities and challenges offered by 
    CMC. 
    <p>4. To introduce some working practices that will save you time and effort 
    as a tutor. </p></blockquote>
	
	<p>Note that these aims are limited: our concern is 
  to help you 'get up to speed', and to lay solid foundations for the continuing 
  development of your conference moderation skills ... This training programme 
  will have succeeded if, not later than the start of the course, you feel 
  'ready enough' to start using <i>FirstClass</i><sup>TM</sup> and CMC in 
  earnest with your students and colleagues.</p> 
  <p>The following objectives of the programme are offered to help you decide 
  when you are ready for the start of the (B800) course - and have, therefore, 
  completed the programme. 
  <p>As regards <i>FirstClass</i><sup>TM</sup> commands and operations, by the 
  end of the Training Programme, you should be able to: 
  <ul>
    <li>read a message in your mailbox, or in a conference 
    <li>send, forward or reply to a message 
    <li>upload an attachment from your hard disk 
    <li>download an attachment to your hard disk 
    <li>create an address book 
    <li>create a mailing list for posting messages to all your students' 
    mailboxes 
    <li>check the history of a message 
    <li>check the directory for a particular name 
    <li>check a user's résumé 
    <li>post your own résumé 
    <li>create folders within your mailbox to contain different categories of 
    message 
    <li>post a message and then withdraw it! use the Search command to find all 
    messages on a given subject </li></ul>
  <p>As regards Netiquette, you should, by the end of the Programme, be able to: 

  <ul>
    <li>explain, in your own words, the terminology and issues associated with 
    Netiquette - e.g. flaming, emoticons, IMHO, self-discipline in placing 
    messages appropriately, the Practical Communication Principles, copyright, 
    and the Code of Conduct 
    <li>recognise good and bad practice and respond appropriately. 
    <li>As regards tutoring on-line, you should, by the end of the Programme, be 
    able to: 
    <li>suggest designs for CMC discussions and tasks in relation to assignments 
    and other course components 
    <li>plan how you will initiate, support and draw together such discussions 
    <li>recognise the advantages and disadvantages of intervening in different 
    ways if a discussion appears to be heated, or a student's contributions 
    appear inappropriate 
    <li>recognise the importance of setting a supportive tone and stimulating 
    involvement at the beginning of the course, and have specific ideas for 
    doing this.</li></ul>
  <p>As regards working practices, by the end of the Programme, you should be 
  able to: 
  <ul>
    <li>plan the directories and sub-directories you will use to organise and 
    store B800 CMC materials on your hard disk for future use 
    <li>use folders to organise and sort your messages 
    <li>identify specific <i>FirstClass</i> <sup>TM</sup> and Windows 
    'shortcuts' to facilitate your chosen way of working 
    <li>use the advice and discussions on-line to continue developing efficient 
    working practices.</li></ul>

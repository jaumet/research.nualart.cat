<P>
This issue of <I>Information Research</I> is rather unusual in that it apparently consists of only one paper - a report on the Department of Information Studies' <b>Second International Symposium on Networked Learner Support</b> from Sarah Ashton.   However, all is not as it seems:  there are links from the report to the Symposium web-site and to the twelve papers presented at the Symposium.   The reader of <i>Information Research</i>, therefore, has an opportunity to catch up on developments in this relatively new area of information science and librarianship research.   The papers themselves come from around the world, giving a truly international flavour to the event and to this issue of the journal.

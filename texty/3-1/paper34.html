<br>
  <h3>Background</h3>
<p>  In recent years there has been growing interest in the idea 
  of using asynchronous E Mail discussion lists and conferencing software for 
  professional development both within formal and informal learning contexts. 
  Gundry, for example, describes the use of such on line discussion within a 
  business organisation, in this case a large multinational computer company in 
  which nearly everyone has Internet or Intranet access and where people 
  willingly share information on line as part of a culture of continuous 
  improvement (Gundry 1991). This is a rather unproblematic view of professional 
  learning but does draw on some key contemporary concerns for anyone involved 
  in their own or in other’s professional development. The first, is the idea 
  that professional development requires peer exchange (rather than top down 
  transmission) of ideas and information which best takes place within 
  “flattened” organisational hierarchies. The second, is that the creation and 
  assimilation of knowledge has become a commercial imperative for many 
  companies with the idea that knowledge has become the greatest commercial 
  resource (eg Thomas,.1992). The third, is the idea that professionals are 
  working in a climate of accelerated change in which they need to access up to 
  date knowledge and to apply new skills flexibly in changing circumstances, (eg 
  Hargreaves, 1994 pp 3-92).</p> 
  <p>These three concerns have helped inform the development of various 
  professional development forums and accredited courses. For example, Bonamy 
  and Hauglusaine- Charlier discuss the idea that knowledge can be created and 
  assimilated through on line exchange of, and reflection on, practical and 
  contextualised examples and descriptions, (Bonamy et al, 1995). Lewis argues 
  that collaboration between individuals on line provides access to a much wider 
  knowledge base than that of any individual (Lewis 1995) and McConnell has 
  argued for a form of collaborative supported co-operative learning both for 
  motivational reasons and for learning in ways appropriate for professional 
  needs, (McConnell 1994).</p>
  <p>The Just in Time Open Learning project (JITOL) at the University of 
  Sheffield has been exploring some of the issues associated with on line 
  learning for professional development within different contexts (<a 
  href="http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/projects/jitol/">http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/projects/jitol/</a> 
  and see Hammond, in press, Edwards and Hammond, 1997). These projects have 
  demonstrated the opportunities which network learning offers for learners to 
  get to know each other; to articulate ideas through writing; to pick up new 
  ideas though reading messages; to be stimulated by working with other learners 
  and to explore and develop their own on line resources. However projects have 
  demonstrated the constraints on participation. These include lack of time; 
  server unreliability; the difficulty of acquiring sufficient technical skills; 
  physical constraints on writing; reticence in communicating in public; access 
  to technology and, most crucially, organisational or course culture. The 
  projects have illustrated the complexity of developing on line sharing but 
  also found a desire to continue and learn from experience. In this paper I 
  will draw on work in progress within the JITOL project to discuss some of the 
  issues associated with on line discussion. There have been numerous approaches 
  to describing such discussions (see, for example, Harasim on the idea of 
  mapping interconnection between messages, Harasim, 1989; Henri for a schedule 
  for categorising the functions of different messages, Henri, 1991; Mason for a 
  general overview, Mason, 1991; and Hodgson and McConnell for a gender analysis 
  of messages, Hodgson et al, 1995). The approach taken here is to use an 
  extract from a discussion within a forum for members of an MEd course in 
  telematic learning in order to focus on the initiation of on line debate; the 
  characterisation of the messages and finally the idea of knowledge creation 
  within a conference. The discussion chosen concerns a comparison between 
  images and text and contains contributions from myself, a tutor, Greg, course 
  director, and two other members of the course Lesley a librarian, with 
  responsibilities for providing library resources on the course, and Juliet a 
  lecturer at a college of further education. Both Lesley and Juliet are working 
  towards their MEd degree. This excerpt is a snapshot from a longer discussion 
  and those taking part have contributed to many other discussions using a wide 
  range of writing styles. </p>

  <p style="font-size: small; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font: Comic Sans MS;">Good to see you have got started with Lotus Notes, looked interesting the 
  comments from Deakin University, btw do you have any thoughts on the 
  limitations of text based communication in comparison to multimedia?</p>
   
  <h5>Lesley on 04/11/96 at 16:23</h5>
  <hr>
<p style="font-size: small; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font: Comic Sans MS;">Multimedia obviously gives the advantage of combining visual and audio aids as 
  well as plain text. However multimedia over a network requires much higher 
  bandwith and specifications for PCs so might reduce access if the technology 
  isn't available to distance learners. Multimedia on a CDROM in the post to 
  everyone might be cheaper than downloading from a central service. 
  <br>Personally I feel that it is the interaction between learner and tutor 
  that is important. Some of the computer aided learning packages that have been 
  developed have the problem that they do not allow for this interaction but are 
  too didatic. When I was looking at CMC tools for Module 2 I found the Moos 
  interesting from that point of view, you could show/play clips of material, 
  either text, audio or visual; use a whiteboard to draw diagrams, cut and paste 
  Web pages etc; and carry on a conversation at the same time - either to one 
  individual or to a group. Only problem as far as I could see was that the 
  technology required a *very steep* learning curve in finding out how to 
  navigate through the virtual space both on the part of the tutor and then on 
  the part of the students. Given existing problems with getting to grips with 
  new applications and technical hitches, I am not sure that this could be 
  easily overcome at present but am positive that with the development going on 
  in this area it will not be long before somebody has devised a user friendly 
  interface.<br>Lesley</p>
 <h5>Mick on 18/11/96 at 15:01</h5>
  <hr>
  <p style="font-size: small; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font: Comic Sans MS;">Lesley , sorry I mispelt your name, before, I havent dipped back into LN as I 
  have been following the email and COW stuff, I was intrigued by your thoughts 
  on multi media, I agree very often learners are left alone on the machine and 
  it is the interaction between learner and tutor and between learner and 
  learner where it all takes place, still I look forward to full multi media in 
  conferences like this - would you rather post a video footage of your self or 
  text?</p>
 <h5>Lesley on 18/11/96 at 15:28</h5>
  <hr>
  <p style="font-size: small; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font: Comic Sans MS;">Text generally. I remember things I have read better than what I have heard. 
  Having said that the two combined are even more effective. My main concern 
  with using video via telematics is the access to the technology - video over 
  the network requires a high level of bandwidth to get any quality of picture. 
  Do prospective students on telematics courses have the necessary hardware and 
  access over phone lines. With people being used to television, video 
  conferencing generally compares badly unless of a high quality and can detract 
  from concentrating on the message. Clive Cochrane from Queen's University 
  Belfast has written quite extensively about this. One of his papers is 
  available on the 1st International Symposium on Networked Learner Support WWW 
  page. http://panizzi.shef.ac.uk/nls_symp/cochrane.html<br>Lesley</p>
 <h5>Mick on 20/11/96 at 12:47</h5>
  <hr>
  <p style="font-size: small; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font: Comic Sans MS;">Lesley I have responded to your message as a new thread in case anyone wants 
  to join in, my feeling is that in the future dont know when, we will send 
  video clips all the time and people will look back at text based email as the 
  days of the wireless before telly - I actually like the radio but that is 
  another point. The key point for me is that no-one can write as quickly as 
  they can speak, I actually like writing but I think that most people will 
  prefer speech. Anyway I throw it out for discussion.</p> 
  <h5>Juliet on 20/11/96 at 20:13</h5> 
  <hr>
  <p style="font-size: small; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font: Comic Sans MS;">Hi Mick I agree entirely with your statement. From past experience with 
  students verbal discussion, once started, was no problem but as soon as pen 
  and paper was introduced, moans and groans were evident.</p>
  <h5>Greg on 24/11/96 at 19:30</h5> 
  <hr>
  <p style="font-size: small; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font: Comic Sans MS;">yes take the point juliet....but different media can be used for different 
  purposes. Writing is deemed to be THE important medium in Universities...how 
  important is it for your students to be able to write ?<br>Greg</p>
  <h5>Juliet on 02/12/96 at 21:47</h5>
  <hr>
  <p style="font-size: small; font-family: sans-serif; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font: Comic Sans MS;">Writing is important for the students I am currently working with in SME's. I 
  was referring to my experiences with students in the past who had just left 
  school and college I felt was perhaps a second or even third option. Having a 
  job and earning money is really what the majority of young people wanted. 
  Since gaining qualifications could not guarantee a job it was a difficult task 
  trying to motivate these young people who were understandably disillusioned 
  with their lot.<br>Juliet</p>
  <hr> 
  <h3>Discussion</h3>
  
<p>  Here I want to address four questions about the process of 
  on line debate:</p> 
  
  <blockquote>How did the discussion get started?<br>Is there a preferred 
    style or “genre” of message? <br>Are the contributions to the forum best 
    thought off as text or speech? and <br>What can one learn by taking part in 
    this debate?</blockquote>
	
	<p>These questions emerged through reflecting on my own 
  participation in different forums and, in particular, on my tutor role in this 
  forum. This led me to carry out a series of semi structured and open ended 
  interviews with participants taking this course in order to compare and 
  contrast perspectives on electronic discussion. I also sought specific 
  comments from the contributors to the discussion on image and text.</p> 
  
  <h4>How did the discussion get started?</h4>
  
  <p>This discussion began with the 
  remark, 'btw do you have any thoughts on the limitations of text based 
  communication in comparison to multimedia?'<br>Although I had the role of 
  tutor this was an off the cuff question to an individual on the course, there 
  was nothing programmed into this part of the course which involved a 
  discussion of multi media and no attempt to direct the discussion either by 
  imposing time deadlines for a response or setting a task around the 
  discussion.</p> 
  <p>There have been various attempts to describe the initiation and maintenance 
  of on line debate. For example, Muscella and Di Mauro suggests that an 
  approach of 'oblique assertion', followed by the citing of personal learning 
  experience and, finally, stating of belief has proved effective way of 
  triggering responses to a message, Muscella et al (1995). Others have used the 
  idea of comfort zones to argue that participants need experience of non 
  controversial debate before embarking on a discussion of contentious issues. 
  These are both useful insights and indicate strategies available to 
  participants and moderators within an electronic forum. But equally important 
  is to recognise the serendipitous nature of much debate. Of course every forum 
  is inevitably structured through the influence of the moderator/tutor and 
  through deciding issues of access (eg is it an open or closed forum?). However 
  there is less opportunity to elicit responses on line than in a face to face 
  context where eye contact can frequently invoke a contribution to the 
  discussion and silences are invariably filled. Perhaps a paradox of on line 
  debate is that its asynchronous nature encourages participation as there are 
  more opportunities to contribute (you can do it as and when you like), but 
  also discourages participation as this flexibility, combined with a sense of a 
  removed audience, means that message writing can be put off. The difficulty of 
  structuring debate has the advantage of openness, giving participants more 
  control over their learning, but can make it difficult to maintain the forum 
  over time. In the exchange quoted both Greg and myself asked open ended 
  questions but we had very little control over who, if anyone, would respond.</p>
   
  <h4>Is there a style or “genre” of message?</h4>
  <p>In this example there is 
  little convergence in style of messages. My contributions begin with 
  acknowledging an earlier message and raising the issue of multi media. In 
  these messages I have constructed the tutor role as one of being quite 
  cautious in offering a view and raising open ended questions for others to 
  follow. The style is reasonably informal and contains an awareness of the 
  audience ('good to see you got started with Lotus Notes', 'sorry I mispelt 
  your name before' (this refers back to an earlier 'typo'). I do offer an 
  opinion on image over text but produce ambiguity by acknowledging that my view 
  is probably a minority one ('I actually like writing but I think that most 
  people will prefer speech'.) My own writing draws on past writing experiences, 
  such as contributing to 'chatty' newsletters, but like other writers I use 
  colloquialisms such as 'telly' which are more associated with conversational 
  discourse, as well as telegram style abbreviation ('good to see you', and 
  'btw'). I remember writing these messages fairly quickly, probably just 
  checking them once for meaning and for obvious spelling mistakes (though 
  'mispelt' and 'havent' have slipped through). I was interested in the topic 
  through other research I was doing felt fairly confident and relaxed about 
  contributing to the debate.</p>
  <p>Lesley’s messages are much longer 254 and 124 words respectively. They 
  carry a strong sense of professional voice; the first paragraph of the first 
  message perhaps reads as something she might write in an essay or to a 
  professional forum. They are strongly “message” rather than “audience” focused 
  messages (Tannen, 1985). The first message is written as a reply to my query 
  but it is also for general consumption. This creates difficulties in getting 
  the right pitch:</p> 
  <blockquote>'In this piece I felt I was talking to one person. I was aware 
    that other people might not understand the jargon but then I could rephrase 
    it if someone asked, but where do you pitch it? You don't want to talk down 
    to someone but you don't want to lose them either?'</blockquote>
	<p>Lesley’s 
  messages are well considered and she obviously took care and attention to the 
  coherence of what she was writing as well as to grammar and spelling. The 
  topic was one of professional concern to her and it was because of this that 
  she found the time to reply in such detail.</p> 
  <p>In contrast Greg’s message is much shorter (35 words) and is much less 
  formal in style, signalled by colloquialism ('I take the point juliet') and by 
  its apparently unedited structure. Greg’s message seems more in the style of a 
  scripted conversation (scripted as it lacks the 'ums', 'ers' and other fillers 
  of most conversation) and is abbreviated into a kind of telegramese ('yes take 
  the point') What is important to Greg is to contribute, to signal a presence, 
  and this is done, because of both time pressure and conscious intention, 
  through a spontaneous response. The role of the message is to try to keep the 
  debate alive by seeking clarification or more information - Greg too takes a 
  responsibility for asking open ended questions.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Juliet describes her message as a hybrid of the formal and 
  informal. It is casual but influenced by the kind of writing she has done at 
  work and her background training in word processing. She begins informally in 
  the first message ('Hi Mick I agree entirely...' but then moves to more formal 
  vocabulary 'I agree entirely with your <i>statement</i>', not the more 
  informal 'I agree with what you were saying'. The next sentence begins with 
  the more formal passive form but then uses the informal vocabulary of 'moans 
  and groans'. She recalls feeling relaxed about sending this message but being 
  continually aware that messages might not be read as she intended.</p> 
  <p>Nearly all contributions draw on personal experience for agreeing and 
  disagreeing, and are prefaced with comments such as 'from past experience', 'I 
  actually like writing', 'when I was looking at CMC tools', 'I remember things 
  I have read better'. There is a strong sense of audience involvement here (not 
  withstanding earlier comments this includes Lesley’s messages) and a desire to 
  make a point but not to offend. As one participant on the forum put it:</p>
  <blockquote>'I write about my experience, that’s how I would disagree with 
    someone, I would speak from the heart, it means saying what you think . You 
    have to consider their feelings as you can’t see them bristling, so what I 
    put is fairly mild.' </blockquote>
	
	<p>The much publicised incidences of flaming 
  would more likely be associated with forums which had a weak sense of audience 
  (some of these issues are discussed further in Perolle, 1991 and Sproull, 
  1991). Here the tone of the discussion is cautious and respectful; perhaps 
  this is because the context is one in which participants are feeling their way 
  or perhaps this reservation is characteristic of the academic culture of which 
  contributors are part and perhaps participants feel this is the most effective 
  way of offering support and maintaining a learning community.</p>
   
  <p>One good reason for being cautious in affirming or disagreeing is that 
  messages are permanently stored and it is not as easy to retract or refine a 
  position as it would be in conversation in which we use phrases such as &quot;what 
  I really meant to say was..&quot; to what seems, at times, effortlessly shift 
  position. Messages arrive without non verbal clues and can easily 
  misinterpreted, eg irony can, and frequently does, sound like sarcasm. In this 
  excerpt writers have used capitals and asterix for emphasis, (&quot;Writing is 
  deemed to be THE important medium&quot;; &quot;the technology required a *very steep* 
  learning curve&quot;) and could no doubt make use of other devices such as 
  &quot;emoticons&quot; to soften the impact of any disagreement, but this can only go so 
  far in clearing the ambiguity. In any case not everyone is comfortable with 
  emoticons; as one of the contributors here said, &quot;I am slowly getting used to 
  them and used one the other day but I do find them rather twee&quot;.</p>
  
  <p>Would participants benefit from adopting a more direct style, there is for 
  example something much brusquer and challenging in Greg’s message? One cannot 
  say with any certainty. Greater directness would make it easier to pull out 
  just where agreement and disagreement begin and end but it might also impact 
  on the development of a mutually supportive learning community in which 
  writers express their concern and respect for all contributions. There is also 
  a cultural context too, and participants on several forums have noticed a 
  directness in strongly North American based forums with which they are simply 
  uncomfortable.</p>
   
  <p>In this brief exchange all contributors stressed that getting a response 
  was more important than the style of the response; as one participants put it 
  “we can all learn from each other, it doesn’t matter how confident they are in 
  their writing.” And within the course as a whole, contributors felt a great 
  deal of satisfaction whenever they got a response. This led to a multiplier 
  effect, if a message received few replies the discussion would dry up but if 
  there were many replies contributors felt not only did they have points to 
  which they could respond but they also felt a greater willingness to engage in 
  the whole process of on-line debate. However while the importance of getting 
  any sort of reply was valued there were variations in emphasis within the 
  forum as a whole. One of the course members said that in fact she did find 
  grammar (or at least coherence) and spelling were important while another was 
  far more laissez faire about style. Some one else spoke in general terms about 
  their problems in finding the time to process very long messages, while others 
  said that there was little value in short, one line messages and could be 
  irritated by them.</p> 
  <h4>Are the contributions to the forum better described as text or 
  speech?</h4>
 <p> Several course participants have suggested that electronic text is 
  a half way between writing and speech as it carries some of the spontaneity of 
  speech with the coherence and permanence of text. The question here is whether 
  speech or text work better as a metaphor for on line “conversation” and does 
  it matter?</p>
  <p>My own view is that messages are best thought of as writing for the very 
  commonsensical reason that contributing is an act of writing and that writing 
  can cover a wider range of activities. (As Tannen points out it is common to 
  equate speech with impromptu conversation and text with the literary essay 
  (see Tannen, <i>op. cit.</i>), but there are many styles or genres within each form of 
  communication.) Of course electronic discussion is more interactive than many 
  forms of writing but interactivity is by no means unique to electronic formats 
  (for example, think about the practices of a writers' group or even the 
  letters pages in newspapers). The interactivity of the format allows question 
  and response (for example Juliet's second message, in response to Greg, allows 
  her to define which students she had in mind) but this brief misunderstanding 
  also suggests shows that a reader cannot butt in to seek clarification, as can 
  often be done in conversation, and nor can the writer pick up on non visual 
  clues in order to tailor their remarks. The writing metaphor also helps us to 
  understand that contributors might feel constrained by the medium, as even 
  with typing skills it takes longer to write something than to speak. In 
  addition, many people do feel anxiety about expressing their thoughts through 
  writing, especially writing for 'publication' as in electronic discussion 
  lists, and this holds for academics and library professionals who often carry 
  a sense that they will be judged not only on what they say but how they say 
  it. If all this makes writing sound quite unattractive the other side of the 
  coin is that contributors often value the 'plasticity' of the medium, i.e., the 
  way they can reflect on what they have written and re shape their text to get 
  the meaning clear both for themselves and for their audience. In addition the 
  absence of non visual clues can actually be an advantage in reading as such 
  clues can distract as well as inform. Finally, the very notion of writing for 
  publication is what many people value within on line forums as they are 
  provided with permanent records of other people’s views on which they can 
  reflect.</p>
  <p>The writing metaphor then works in drawing attention to the features of 
  electronic discussion, but falls down if it leads us to see on line debate as 
  a literary/academic form. Of course in some contexts discussion might well 
  be literary/academic in style but it does not need to be. The metaphor of 
  writing needs to be qualified to show the nature of different styles and the 
  desire contributors have for interactional messages, which may do no more than 
  signal presence.</p>
  <p>The search for metaphor is an important one and unless we can make these 
  metaphors clear, or agree to live with divergence, there is a real danger of 
  mismatch. In the extract we can see competing styles of communication and 
  while there is tolerance this can lead to tensions. For example, if we decide 
  on the essay as a metaphor for on line discussion we might be expecting fewer 
  contributions but ones which are more considered, we might also get irritated 
  with short, apparently flippant, one line comments. If we use the conversation 
  metaphor we would expect frequent messages, short and apparently spontaneous 
  in nature, and we might become irritated by long messages which we have 
  neither the time nor inclination to read. The hybrid, say, the letters to a 
  newsletter metaphor, is a convenient half way house, but might not be the 
  preferred style of the group. Further clarity over metaphors might also help 
  those who are reticent to participate; the advice we give is so often 'just go 
  for it and send something off' but we can rarely describe what 'going for it' 
  means.</p> 
  <h4>What can one learn by taking part in on line debate?</h4>
 <p> From following 
  the exchanges within the extract someone with an emerging professional 
  interest in networked learning might learn that there are different views of 
  pedagogy concerning the use of computers in education; that there are 
  pedagogical issues associated with computer conferencing; there are references 
  to further sources on the WWW (the urls of two sites are included); there are 
  different experiences in comparing multi media and text and generally feel 
  able to orient themselves within a new field. Some of the abbreviations and 
  terminology may prove difficult but a participant to the forum would be able 
  to seek clarification from writers. In addition participants would have the 
  opportunity to sharpen their own ideas on the topic through more extended 
  contributions of their own. These are by any account important outcomes and 
  help explain the excitement many of us feel for networked learning. However 
  there are two limitations of this kind of asynchronous discussion to which I 
  draw attention.</p> 
  <p>Firstly, much discussion within electronic forums concerns mediated 
  knowledge, that is it deals with descriptions of events and is one removed 
  from the experience of the events themselves. In the excerpt this was only 
  partially true in that the shared direct experience of contributing to the 
  discussion could have been part of the discussion itself. But in the main, 
  writers were <i>sharing</i> experiences not talking about <i>shared</i> 
  experiences. This means, and it is important to say it, that taking part in a 
  discussion would not have equipped anyone to introduce video conferencing 
  within their institution. Other experiences, including hands on demonstration 
  and practice would be needed for that. Of course mediated knowledge is a 
  valuable kind of knowing and one particularly valued in academia but it is not 
  the only kind of knowledge and not the only route for professional 
  development. There is a strong case for a “multi modal” approach to 
  professional learning which integrates on line discussion with face to face 
  activity based learning.</p>
  <p>Secondly, the idea of professional development within an on line learning 
  environment needs to focus on individual engagement with the discussion. This 
  engagement may or may not mean participation within the debate but it would 
  certainly main an active attempt by the learner to compare and contrast new 
  view points in the light of their existing knowledge and professional 
  experience. This is a time consuming and complex process. The implication here 
  is that if we are seriously promoting on line learning as a form of 
  professional development it will require learners willing to learn and 
  organisations willing to provide technical, time and other support for 
  learners and to nurture a culture in which continual development is not only 
  expected but valued.</p> 
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>At the start of the paper I suggested that electronic forums 
  have the potential to support new approaches to professional development which 
  are every appropriate for contemporary working environments. My discussion 
  illustrates some of the opportunities which electronic debate give learners to 
  develop up to date knowledge in new areas of expertise. However my discussion 
  also highlights some of the complexities of on line debate; the difficulty of 
  structuring debate, the variance in approaches to writing and the search for 
  an appropriate metaphor for describing on line discussion. I also argue that 
  on line discussion requires commitment from those taking part and a culture, 
  within a course or an organisation, which nurtures the sharing of information 
  and perspectives. I argue that on line debate is both complex <i>and 
  </i>valuable.</p>

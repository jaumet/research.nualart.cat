  <h1>Continuing professional development for networked learner support: progress review of research and curriculum design</h1>
  <h4><a href="mailto:p.levy@sheffield.ac.uk">Philippa 
  Levy</a><br>Department of Information Studies, University of Sheffield</h4> 
<br>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  
<p>  In a paper in the autumn 1995 issue of the <i>Journal of 
  Documentation</i>, my colleague Sue Fowell and I speculated on the future of 
  learner support in higher education, and suggested a broad professional 
  development framework for information staff likely to be involved in 
  developing on-line approaches to providing information support in the 
  networked learning environment. We adopted the term "networked learner 
  support" (NLS) to denote computer-mediated approaches to enquiry/reference 
  assistance, user education and skills training for users of electronic 
  information resources, and suggested that the new combination of skills 
  required for effective provision of NLS would encompass information and IT 
  expertise, as well as expertise in the educational uses of new information and 
  communication technologies. In the light of this, we proposed a continuing 
  professional development (CPD) model for NLS based on on-line experiential and 
  collaborative learning.(1)</p>
   
  <p>Since then, largely through the eLib funded <i>NetLinkS</i> project and in 
  collaboration with other members of the <i>NetLinkS</i> team, I have been 
  engaged in further exploration of NLS practice and have been working on the 
  design of an on-line professional development course for staff with an 
  involvement in this new area of information activity.(2,3) This paper focuses 
  on what has been learnt through the <i>NetLinkS</i> project about professional 
  development and training needs for NLS, and describes the underpinning 
  rationale and curriculum model for the new on-line course. The research on 
  which the paper draws, which aimed to assess the validity of the CPD concepts 
  initially proposed and to feed into further refinement of the curriculum 
  model, was carried out by means of focus group discussions in nineteen UK 
  institutions of higher education during 1995-6, and is currently being 
  followed up by one-to-one interviews with a range of staff with interests and 
  involvement in NLS.(4,5)</p>
   
  <p>Participants in focus groups and interviews have included information staff 
  with both strategic and operational perspectives on NLS. All have anticipated 
  significant further development of their institutions' Web-based approaches to 
  information support, as well as other computer-mediated approaches. Attitudes 
  to this prospect have varied widely, along a spectrum ranging from enthusiasm 
  to gloomy resignation, but whatever the position taken on this, there has been 
  strong emphasis on a significant CPD requirement, as illustrated by comments 
  such as these:</p> 
  
  <blockquote><i>"Perhaps we all need to move into a state where we all move 
    to a new plane of operation. We actually have many core skills which are not 
    up to date enough."</i> 
    <p><i>"There's a vast need for staff development and taking everybody on 
    board and training them... I think that that has vast implications and has 
    to be looked at. There is this wide need for staff development and training, 
    it's the cultural change of the staff and making sure that they're all 
    committed to it."</i> 
    <p><i>"Most of us would love to do this but we haven't got the skills to do 
    it. I feel I would have to be removed from my job to have the time to 
    develop those skills and then I'd be much more effective in my job."</i> 
  </p></blockquote>
  
  <p>Development of NLS has been seen as largely dependent on 
  institutions' commitment to enhancing the network infrastructure and putting 
  resources into adequate staffing and staff training. A common concern has been 
  that suitable staff development and training for NLS is not currently 
  available within many institutions, because of severe resourcing constraints 
  and because lack of strategic planning for NLS at organisational level means 
  that CPD needs are not yet being addressed.</p> 
  
  <h3>CPD for NLS: which staff?</h3>
<p>  The emergence of a complex electronic 
  communications and information environment for learning and research is 
  bringing into sharp focus a key educational role for the services and staff 
  with responsibility for promoting skilled use of electronic information 
  resources. Within this context, the development of NLS entails new 
  professional skills, partnerships and role-perceptions on the part of a wide 
  range of support (and academic) staff. <i>NetLinkS</i> is concerned with the 
  identification and provision of appropriate professional development for 
  support staff involved in NLS. The task is complicated at the outset by the 
  fact that it is not a simple matter to identify one homogeneous group of staff 
  across the sector at whom training for NLS should be targeted. The theme of 
  diverse and overlapping staff involvement in information support for networked 
  learning has emerged strongly in the course of our research, with perspectives 
  varying according to individual roles and differing organisational structures.</p> 

  <p>Within libraries (and, commonly, converged information/IT services often 
  known as "learning resource centres") the actual and potential NLS involvement 
  of a wide range of information specialists was identified by focus group 
  participants, including subject specialists, networked information specialists 
  and others in more generalist library positions. However, traditional 
  library/information positions were observed to be only part of a wider 
  picture, which revealed widespread (often <i>ad hoc</i>) development of new 
  "hybrid" support roles in which traditional areas of IT and information 
  expertise converge. The fact that computers and information are now 
  inextricably linked means that many aspects of library and computing support 
  have become more difficult to distinguish, and the convergence of IT and 
  information support needs was identified as a crucial educational issue for 
  the new environment, with far-reaching implications for individual staff roles 
  and for the general organisation of support. Library specialists were needing 
  to become more involved in provision of technical support, and computing 
  staff, conversely, were experiencing a need to become more experienced in 
  information matters, as illustrated by the typical comments below:</p>
   
  <blockquote><i>"There's always been a point at which you [as a librarian] 
    break off... but that point is always moving further in one direction so 
    that we're all expected to do more and more of the IT."</i> (Information 
    specialist). 
    <p><i>"I think if you're involved in these things it's difficult to separate 
    the information content from the process of getting there, and therefore 
    inevitably even if you could say that our primary responsibility [as 
    computing specialists] is helping with the process and [the library's] is 
    the information, you can't in any meaningful way distinguish between the 
    two. Consequently one is picking up a lot of knowledge about information 
    along the way and the enquiries we used to push back at you at an earlier 
    stage we probably wouldn't need to now."</i> (IT specialist). 
  </p></blockquote>
  
  <p>This theme arose, too, during the recent UKOLN <i>Digital 
  Libraries: Beyond the beginning conference</i>, during which the head of a 
  newly converged service expressed his requirement for "converged individuals" 
  amongst his staff, and drew attention to the paucity of suitable CPD to 
  support such development.(6) 
  
  <p>As well as for information staff, computing staff and new "hybrids" between 
  the two, NLS was identified as an area of interest (at least at the level of 
  awareness) for staff in teaching and learning support positions related to 
  promoting the networked learning environment. Thus, CPD for NLS might be 
  targeted at a very wide variety of staff with different backgrounds and 
  specialisations, including those with titles such as the following: Subject 
  Librarian, Internet Information Officer; Networked Information Officer; 
  Learning Technology Adviser; Humanities IT Development Officer; Library 
  Computing Development Officer; Internet Librarian; Distance Learning 
  Development Officer; CWIS Officer, Flexible Learning Officer, Computer 
  Services User Support Officer, Learning Resources Specialist. The nature of 
  these positions varies substantially, but all have a stake in NLS. 
  <p>To complicate matters still further, information support for networked 
  learning is also provided by teaching staff within academic departments, and 
  there were indications from focus groups that the traditional split between 
  teaching and information resource provision in academic departments was 
  beginning to break down in some cases, as a consequence of academics' 
  involvement in creating Web resources for courses.</p>
   
  <p>It is clear, therefore, that learner support roles within and outside the 
  library service are changing in response to network user needs, and new roles 
  are emerging in many parts of institutions to support both staff and students. 
  While information support for networked teaching and learning is central to 
  the library's role, it is clear that information support issues, including 
  CPD, need to be seen within the wider, multi-disciplinary and converging 
  context of institutional support for networked learning:</p>
  
  <blockquote><i>"A lot of the documentation that has come out of eLib 
    projects has focused in its wording on librarians, where in fact what we're 
    talking about is a range of people who inter-relate on these things... what 
    we are talking about is support services in general and how it's split up 
    varies very much from one institution to another."</i> </blockquote>
	
	<p>Given the 
  need to bring together hitherto separate areas of expertise for NLS, the 
  generally held view in focus groups was that necessary skills and activities 
  should be shared between staff in a range of different roles. An "all-singing, 
  all-dancing" NLS specialist with skills in all required areas was not seen as 
  possible, on the basis that few individuals would be likely to have, or be 
  capable of developing, the full, complex combination of skills required. Thus, 
  while further skilling was a key theme in relation to staffing, so equally, 
  were the themes of collaboration and co-ordination. Attention was drawn in 
  particular to the need for closer partnerships between colleagues with 
  complementary skills in IT and information resource discovery/use, while the 
  need for collaboration between these staff and teaching and learning 
  specialists was also identified in some cases. The idea of an NLS team emerged 
  in some groups, bringing together skills in information, IT and on-line 
  teaching/learning methods:</p>
   
  <blockquote><i>"We'd need to have a team approach because if you're asking 
    anyone, library staff or anyone else, to know about learning styles, and the 
    way people learn... and all the networking technical skills plus all the 
    information skills then that's an enormous task, probably not wise to 
    attempt."</i> </blockquote>
	
	<p>From this perspective, one focus group participant 
  could envisage a quite different way of organising information support in the 
  future, entailing a different institutional and professional role for 
  information staff:</p>
   
  <blockquote><i>"A long way ahead we can see where this Library is no bigger 
    than an office with all our subject librarians distributed into 
    departments... and either double up as, or collaborate with, IT service 
    staff as technical help."</i> </blockquote>
	
	<p>While some of the focus group 
  institutions already had individual staff posts with particular responsibility 
  for supporting networked information use across campus, in others, the idea of 
  appointing a co-ordinator role for NLS emerged in the course of discussion. It 
  was suggested that a central co-ordinator would help to keep the profile of 
  NLS high, would ensure that the expertise needed was available, and would 
  generally spearhead the changes necessary to develop NLS right across the 
  institution.</p>
   
  <p>To return to the question, then, of which staff should be targeted for CPD 
  for NLS - this would seem to be very much dependent on local circumstances. 
  Strategic planning for NLS will need to take into account the CPD needs of a 
  range of staff, given the need for a multi-disciplinary approach to 
  information support in the networked learning environment. Clearly, too, a 
  single training model could not be designed to fulfil all needs of such a 
  heterogeneous group of staff, and staff will need to be able to adopt a "pick 
  and mix" approach to their professional development, depending on their 
  particular needs. Nevertheless, the convergence of information support roles 
  around the challenge to exploit the Internet as a learning environment offers 
  scope for designing a flexible CPD curriculum model of relevance to a 
  significant proportion of these staff.</p>
   
  <h3>CPD for NLS: which skills?</h3>
 <p> Focus group participants were asked to 
  identify current awarenesss and training needs associated with further 
  development of NLS, and to consider the potential value to them and their 
  institutions of an on-line distance learning course designed to meet some of 
  these needs. Skills gaps were identified in the areas of information 
  technology, information resources and educational applications of the 
  networked environment, as well as in cross-disciplinary team-work and the 
  management of change and innovation. More broadly, participants identified a 
  need for cultural change in relation to role perceptions and the way learner 
  support is conceived of in organisations. The following paragraphs summarise 
  perspectives on these issues.</p> 
  
  <p><b>IT expertise. </b>A strong basic foundation in IT and network skills was 
  identified as a fundamental pre-requisite for all staff involved in NLS, 
  although a significant "grey area" was identified in terms of the extent of IT 
  expertise required by library specialists.</p>
   
  <p><b>Information expertise.</b> Individual specialisation in the use and 
  evaluation of networked information resources varies among staff involved in 
  NLS, but a solid foundation in this area was also identified as essential. 
  Both IT and library staff in the discussion groups identified needs for 
  continuing development in this area. </p>
  <p><b>Educational skills for the networked learning environment.</b> A very 
  broad range of educational skills for the on-line environment was seen as 
  essential for a variety of NLS activities. Awareness of emerging educational 
  uses of networked technologies was seen as the foundation for more in-depth 
  specialisation, and it was felt that a good deal of general awareness-raising 
  in this respect still needed to be done. Participants in the groups expressed 
  a desire for information-sharing between institutions about the use of 
  networked methods for information support and teaching/learning more 
  generally, and were keen to have access to illustrations of good practice. 
  Involvement in professional forums dealing with educational issues was also 
  seen as vital for library and other staff likely to be involved in NLS:</p>
   
  <blockquote><i>"Awareness is the first thing for staff development, just 
    making sure everybody knows what is there, what can be used, that's the 
    starting point...what sort of projects there are system-wide, too, to see 
    how we're performing."</i> 
    <p><i>"We need to be able to understand the pedagogic environment we're 
    working in."</i> 
    <p><i>"I think we need to be involved in appropriate academic forums. I 
    think email has revolutionised the life of all academic librarians I know... 
    because it's given us contact and the ability to find out what happens 
    elsewhere within a very short space of time and also to move into the areas, 
    and this is where the para-academic role comes in... ALT, CTI, we do need to 
    be involved in these forums."</i> </p></blockquote>
	
	<p>Focus group participants 
  also highlighted the need for a general understanding of the way people learn, 
  particularly in using on-line methods, as a pre-requisite to designing on-line 
  learning materials and courses:</p>
   
  <blockquote><i>"It's building on information skills that we've got, to 
    harness particular evaluation points and also understand learning and 
    different learning styles and how they fit in with all the rest of it."</i> 
    <p><i>"I think you need an awareness of how people learn... a teaching 
    community, a lot of librarians don't come from a teaching background."</i> 
    <p><i>"Knowledge of the diversity of ways people learn and how the 
    technology is working - pedagogic practice and information about what 
    technologies exist."</i> </p></blockquote>
	
	<p>As an extension to this, some 
  participants suggested that in order to work closely with academic staff and 
  to tailor support to local needs, it was important to be aware of differences 
  in teaching/learning cultures at the level of disciplines and departments:</p>
   
  <blockquote><i>"Understanding of pedagogic processes is vital, communication 
    skills... Pedagogic understanding means understanding the methods and 
    techniques of different subject areas, and being able to respond flexibly to 
    those areas. Understanding of the educational process with regard to the 
    on-line environment, the ability to advise, support appropriately."</i> 
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>An emphasis on communication skills for the on-line environment 
  was also commonly expressed:</p>
   
  <blockquote><i>"Styles of communication in particular being adapted to 
    particular media, for example synchronous videoconferencing."</i> 
    <p><i>"Developing a sociology of network use... the etiquette or the social 
    rules of using these things, they are still underdeveloped."</i> 
    <p><i>"Some people will have to practise writing effectively if you are 
    going to deliver the support on-line, so as not to be misunderstood."</i> 
    </p></blockquote>
	
	<p>More specifically, participants emphasised the design and 
  tutoring skills which would be required to create or adapt on-line learning 
  resources and deliver programmes using CMC:</p>
   
  <blockquote>
  <p><i>"The whole issue of designing an</i> [on-line]<i> course so 
    that you're using the technologies, pedagogic issues, how you structure the 
    course... the skills that you require as tutor on-line, support on-line, a 
    whole different set of skills to the designer skills."</i></p> 
    <p><i>"I think from my user education perspective developing learning 
    packages is very time-consuming and is a different set of skills from those 
    which I've had and I think that's a challenge. I think training people how 
    to use networked information and evaluate it is fine and I've got every 
    confidence that the people who do user-education would be able to do it and 
    do it very well, and I think that supporting enquiries that come through 
    email and that kind of thing, and writing Web pages would not be a problem 
    in terms of the staff skills. I think having the space to develop electronic 
    learning packages would be profoundly different and would be difficult."</i></p> 

    <p><i>"Awareness of how to put together learning materials, design skills. 
    How to solve problems with technology."</i> </p>
    <p><i>"Designing material for delivery by electronic means. Some people say, 
    I want to put this brochure on the Web, well you can do it but it's 200 
    pages long, no-one's going to sit there and read it. There's an awful lot of 
    different issues there and of course, there's copyright..."</i> </p>
    <p><i>"It would be useful to have basic packages on different aspects of 
    networked resources that you could adapt, so you don't have to keep 
    re-inventing the wheel."</i> </p>
    <p><i>"If we're making materials available for people to use when they want 
    to learn something, when it's appropriate to them... it'll have to be 
    well-structured, we will have to put a lot of thought into its 
    design..."</i> </p>
    <p><i>"I feel I need to know more about how we could use the network as a 
    learning medium. It's terribly primitive at the moment... the library has 
    only got as far as saying what resources are available, and we've got a 
    growing number of links to material...there's a possibility of a link to a 
    worksheet. That strikes me as very rudimentary, I just wonder whether there 
    are ways of doing something more with the resource we've got, actually 
    perhaps a bit more dynamic for learners... something more than just the 
    equivalent of the pieces of paper."</i> </p></blockquote>
	
	<p>Developing the 
  educational expertise associated with NLS often struck participants in the 
  groups as more problematic than skills development envisaged in the areas of 
  IT or information expertise. For instance:</p> 
  
  <blockquote><i>"Computer-services need more information skills and we have 
    some of them, and Library staff need more computing skills and they already 
    have some of them. Then there are these teaching and learning skills and I'm 
    not quite sure how we acquire them."</i> </blockquote>
	
	<p><b>Team-work and 
  change-management.</b> In addition to the three "technical" skills dimensions 
  of the NLS role - in the areas of IT, information and education - participants 
  identified a number of other less tangible, but nevertheless vital, forms of 
  professional expertise associated with team-work and change agency. It was 
  felt, for instance, that the need to take initiative in team-building and to 
  work in multi-disciplinary groups required particular understanding and 
  skills:</p>
   
  <blockquote><p><i>"Team skills... how you work on a project together and a 
    number of skills, technical and otherwise coming together... the ability to 
    draw in other people's expertise, because it's far more than one person's 
    skills."</i></p> 
    <p><i>"The ability to network and draw together a team to link experts, 
    build bridges, with an intelligent overview of many areas, without 
    necessarily being an expert in any of them."</i> 
    <p><i>"We need to be better at managing overlaps between departments and 
    shared interests such as training and support and ideas about the use of 
    IT."</i> </p></blockquote>
	
	<p>Communication and interpersonal skills were 
  perceived as essential, and were especially emphasised in relation to liaising 
  with academic staff. Perhaps the major challenge identified by participants in 
  relation to change agency in NLS was the need to raise networked information 
  issues with academic staff. A need was therefore identified for support staff 
  involved in NLS to become aware of interpersonal and organisational techniques 
  for encouraging teaching and learning innovation:</p>
   
  <blockquote><i>"An emphasis on interpersonal skills training because it's so 
    intimidating working in this para-academic role... trying to get academics 
    to do things differently and to change the way they teach, and so you need 
    marketing skills and being confident about working away from your base."</i> 

    <p><i>"Political skills and marketing skills are necessary for effecting 
    culture change."</i> </p></blockquote>
	
	<p><b>On-line course.</b> Focus group 
  participants and interviewees have generally responded positively to the idea 
  of an on-line course in the area of NLS. They have pointed to key issues for 
  the design and structure of such a course, with "flexibility" the key overall 
  concept, in terms of both content of, and access to, the course. As we have 
  seen, a challenge for staff development and training for NLS is its 
  cross-disciplinary nature and the range of professional development and 
  training requirements of individuals, depending on their professional 
  background and on the particular area of NLS which they need to take forward:</p> 
  
  <blockquote><p><i>"[A course] would have to derive from what staff are already 
    doing, an enhancement of what they are already doing... it has to relate to 
    their professional practice."</i></p> 
    <p><i>"It would depend on the people who are coming in, and whether you are 
    attracting information professionals or whether you are attracting computing 
    people. It would need a balance because some people would need bringing up 
    to speed on the IT side and technical skills and others would need bringing 
    up to speed on the information side... I would have thought it would be 
    quite possible to develop a course along those lines as long as quite a lot 
    of thinking is done about exactly what its purpose is and exactly who it's 
    aimed at... different routes through it for different people with different 
    backgrounds."</i> </p></blockquote>
	
  <h3>CPD for NLS: an on-line learning approach</h3>
  
  <p>Based on the identification 
  of CPD needs described above, <i>NetLinkS</i> and the Department of 
  Information Studies (DIS) at the University of Sheffield is planning two 
  on-line, distance-learning, professional development courses which aim to 
  provide an overview of current practice and issues in NLS and to offer 
  concrete, practical support for participants' workplace activities in this 
  field. They will focus especially on the potential of CMC and the Web in the 
  provision of reference/enquiry services and user education/training, and on 
  the organisational and professional issues associated with the educational 
  role of information staff in the on-line environment.</p> 
  
  <p>It is not our intention that the courses should try to cover the full range 
  of skills and issues related to NLS, but that they should focus on those areas 
  in which the needs of staff with different backgrounds and skills appear, 
  currently, to converge. Our aim is to complement other national training 
  initiatives (such as the eLib projects <i>Netskills</i> for network skills 
  training, and <i>Edulib</i> for training in more general teaching/learning 
  issues) as well as the local, in-house training provision which may also be 
  available to staff with NLS involvement. For instance, although technical 
  assistance will be available to support participation in the course, training 
  in technical skills (eg. training in HTML) is <i>not</i> part of the course 
  programme. The courses consist of one sixteen-week module offered free of 
  charge as part of the <i>NetLinkS</i> programme, and an extension to this into 
  a year-long, fee-paying University of Sheffield Postgraduate Certificate for 
  staff wishing to gain a qualification.</p> 
  
  <p>The model for the courses is innovative in the LIS field in three main 
  ways. First, in terms of the target groups for which they are designed. 
  Second, in terms of overall topic. And third, in terms of format and approach. 
  Detailed information about the aims, content/approach and access requirements 
  for the courses is available elsewhere; the following paragraphs outline the 
  main underpinning principles and features of their design.</p> 
  
  <p><b>Experiential and collaborative learning</b>. The courses will be 
  delivered via the Internet, using the Web and and a range of electronic 
  communication facilities. They are designed to offer a programme of individual 
  and group activities supported by access to a wide range of on-line resources 
  and tutorial input from teaching staff. A set of resource materials will be 
  developed for each topic covered and participants will take part in 
  discussions and other small-scale group and individual learning activities, as 
  well as personal research using module resource materials and suggested 
  readings as points of departure. All activities and resources are designed to 
  support and feed into work practice. A good deal of emphasis will be placed on 
  exchange of experience and ideas between participants, who will work in small 
  learning sets as well as in a large group and individually, with the aim of 
  forming a flexible on-line "learning community" for the duration of the 
  course. </p>
  <p>The experiential nature of the course is fundamental to the purpose of 
  gaining practical understanding of methods and issues in on-line 
  teaching/support, and of developing skills in using the on-line learning 
  environment. For example, activities on the course will involve the use and 
  review of a range of communication technologies for educational purposes 
  (Web-based conferencing, MOO, chat) and evaluation of a range of educational 
  models for on-line learning. </p>
  <p>The collaborative emphasis of the course is in support of the identified 
  need for exchange of ideas and knowledge-sharing between colleagues in 
  different institutions and roles, and we hope this may encourage 
  cross-institutional collaboration in work-based projects if appropriate. The 
  fact that participants will have complementary experience (enrolments so far 
  indicate diverse IT/information backgrounds) will, we believe, contribute 
  substantially to the learning experience.</p> 
  <p>The design of the course around a variety of participative, inter-linked 
  and non-linear activities, (in comparison with approaches to on-line learning 
  in which individuals move in self-paced, linear fashion through a 
  "hypertextbook") poses special challenges for interface design. We have chosen 
  to build on a design model which has already been established in the 
  Department of Information Studies to facilitate this form of on-line 
  learning.(5,6) </p>
  <p><b>Flexible focus and project work</b>. The courses aim to offer a 
  framework within which participants can pursue their own particular interests 
  and learning needs. A number of core topic areas have been established: 
  current trends in NLS; the Internet as a learning environment (technologies, 
  educational approaches, teaching/learning/support skills); managing 
  innovation. Within these areas, activities and resources are designed to 
  enable participants to identify and pursue issues and techniques which are of 
  particular relevance to them, and where appropriate, to tie in course 
  activities closely to work initiatives through project work.</p> 
  <p><b>Flexible access</b>. The structure of the courses is based on a 
  timetable of collaborative activities (using two and three week time-scales 
  for successive course units), and the expectation that participants will be 
  able to devote at least six hours per week to them, so the pace of individual 
  participation is not, overall, fully flexible. Since involvement will be based 
  to a large extent on asynchronous on-line discussion and activities, 
  participants will need to set aside regular and reasonably frequent times for 
  course activities. Two hours a day on three weekdays would be an ideal 
  arrangement, but individual weekly timetables for the course can be flexible 
  to fit in with personal needs and work patterns. Exceptions to this will be a 
  small number of synchronous on-line activities (in which everyone on the 
  course will participate at the same time). We anticipate that most 
  participants will access the course via their University network, although 
  Internet access from home is another option, and some may arrange to combine 
  the two approaches. </p>
  <p><b>Recognition of participation and certification.</b> To receive a 
  certificate of participation for the <i>NetLinkS</i> course, participants will 
  need to present a portfolio of work which demonstrates their overall 
  involvement in all aspects of it (eg. contributions to on-line group 
  discussions, evidence of reading/research on the topics, completion of topic 
  tasks, write-up of project activity). The Postgraduate Certificate entails 
  assessed project work in addition to presentation of portfolios.</p> 
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>A central theme in our research into this area has been the 
  lack of clear strategy for NLS development in many institutions, with 
  networked methods of service delivery often developing in relatively <i>ad 
  hoc</i> fashion thus far. Our research has identified a strongly perceived 
  need for awareness-raising and professional/organisational development across 
  the sector for NLS, and the course model described above aims to satisfy some 
  of the CPD needs of staff with involvement or likely involvement in NLS. The 
  initial run of the courses (from September 1997) will, essentially, be a pilot 
  exercise on a number of levels, and is being approached as an action research 
  project in its own right. However, much will also depend on the ability and 
  willingness of senior managers in information services to commit staff time to 
  participation in the courses. The <i>NetLinkS</i>/DIS courses aim to offer an 
  opportunity for more extended engagement with issues, techniques and between 
  colleagues than would be possible at a short, one-off training event, but also 
  require a higher level of commitment at organisational level at a time of 
  severe resourcing constraints. We nevertheless hope that, with many 
  institutions beginning to address the challenge to move more squarely into the 
  networked learning environment, and in view of the central role there for 
  information support services, the courses will prove relevant, timely and 
  accessible for a wide group of staff.</p>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  
<p>  Various forms of education and training, based on the 
  classical Computer Based Training (CBT), have become well established within 
  companies and in higher education. With regard to the flexibility in terms of 
  time and location, as well as in terms of incurred cost, they are far superior 
  to traditional forms of instruction. A relatively recent development which has 
  not yet gained widespread acceptance is the use of the World Wide Web (WWW) as 
  a basis and platform for distributed computer assisted teaching and learning. 
  In addition to the advantages outlined with regard to classical CBT, the WWW 
  offers the two advantages of world wide availablity as well as ease of 
  promptly updating courses, but also adds many possibilities of collaborative 
  learning. Using the Java programming language and the ever improving means of 
  online presentation it has become possible to realize sophisticated WWW-based 
  teachware packages which are comparable in terms of appearance and 
  functionality to classical CBT applications created with dedicated authoring 
  systems.</p> 
  <p>When developing this type of online courses a variety of WWW-specific 
  mechanisms have to be taken into consideration. The WWW based hypertext 
  concept, for instance, is particularly ambivalent within this context, as on 
  the one hand it allows for a user determined exploration of learning 
  materials, but on the other hand can create significant orientation problems 
  for the user ("Lost in hyperspace" problem). This potential problem should be 
  met with flexible navigational and orientation guides. Furthermore the 
  learners within a distributed network based environment must not be left to 
  study by themselves, as in the classical CBT situation. In addition to the 
  support integrated into the teachware, it is crucial to offer the assistance 
  of tutors through integrated media channels and to give the students the 
  possibility of collaborative learning sessions with other participants. 
  Finally when designing, preparing and presenting a WWW-based course, a few 
  specific ergonomic and didactic requirements need to be met.</p> 
  <p>At the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, which is spread out over an area 
  of about 500 km2, a project to create a "virtual campus", providing a new type 
  of network based learning experience is currently being run. Part of this 
  undertaking is to create an open environment for teaching, learning and 
  co-operation, which provides students with multimedia WWW-based teachware 
  packages on various subjects. This work, which is being pursued as part of a 
  teleteaching/telelearning project [6], attempts to take into consideration all 
  the requirements outlined above. It aims at incorporating the highest possible 
  level of support into the software itself - in particular through integrated 
  navigational and orientation guides, with subsequent support through tutors, 
  which are available through corresponding communication tools within the 
  distributed environment of learning, teaching and co-operation.</p> 
  <h2>Design of WWW-based teachware packages</h2>
  <h3>Educational approach</h3>
  
  <p>The educational approach within the concepts 
  presented here is influenced by the constructivistic philosophy of learning, 
  which defines learning as an active, self-motivated, context and situation 
  oriented social process [10]. While asynchronous on-demand forms of learning 
  inherently require active and self motivated learning, the demand for context 
  and situation oriented learning is satisfied by providing appropriate 
  interaction modules. They permit the interactive discussion of authentic 
  problems within the individual learning context, and hence offer a means for 
  immediately applying the knowledge gained. For a HTML course for instance a 
  JavaScript-based HTML test editor was developed, which allows the interactive 
  creation and illustration of HTML documents.</p>
   
  <p>In order to offer the learner interactive components as in standard 
  progression tests, a building block was developed in Java, which provides a 
  simple definition of <i>free form and multiple choice questions and 
  answers</i>, that can be integrated into a WWW-based teachware package.</p> 
  <p>To create a social aspect, collaborative, guided learning, as well as 
  multilateral communication and co-operation between learner and instructor are 
  supported. Within this setting the increased activity demanded from the 
  student is met on the instructor side through a role change from a presenter 
  of information to a tutor, coach and moderator [9].</p> 
  <p>One of the main areas of application for WWW-based teachware packages is 
  seen in supplementing conventional forms of teaching and learning. In this 
  capacity they are particularly valuable in conveying basic knowledge. This 
  could be realized by presenting individual university lectures or by 
  integrating course materials from any number of courses into a reference type 
  application. The teachware package hence acts as the basis for a conventional 
  face-to-face lecture series, where the knowledge acquired is discussed in 
  depth.</p> 
  <h3>Screen design</h3>
  
  <p>The multimedia WWW-based teachware packages introduced 
  here draw upon a single unified screen design in all course modules, so that 
  the user quickly becomes familiar with the learning environment and can 
  develop a certain routine when dealing with the individual teachware 
  application. This approach also counteracts the danger of inadvertently 
  leaving the study package, for instance by following links to external sources 
  of information on the WWW. A sudden change in screen design hence indicates to 
  the user that he or she is no longer within the bounds of the original 
  teachware application.</p> 
  
  <p>The goal when designing the graphical user interface (GUI) was to achieve a 
  clear and structured, yet graphically appealing layout. Graphical overload, 
  which is often observed in information services on the Internet, is avoided in 
  order to reduce transfer time. The use of complex backgrounds is completely 
  omitted, as these substantially curtail the readability of the document and 
  lead to fatigue and drop in concentration when the reader is confronted with 
  longer passages of text. High contrast colours are chosen for background and 
  text, by default black type on a white background is used. Since the use of 
  WWW applications is potentially platform independent, one needs to consider 
  different display resolutions when developing teachware packages. This 
  requirement is met by a layout, which is set up for working comfortably at 
  resolutions of 640*480, 800*600, 1024*768 as well as 1152*900.</p>
   
  <p>Figure 1 shows the standard screen design of the multimedia WWW-based 
  teachware packages. The subdivision of the browser window into two separate 
  frames is based on the layout suggested in [7], which calls for the actual 
  information being displayed in the centre of the screen and being supported by 
  core functionalities, such as navigational information and access information, 
  in a persistent frame at the bottom of the screen. Consequently the 
  presentation of course content and the activation of various other functions, 
  which are discussed in chapter 2.3, in the top frame (information frame (2)) 
  is governed by a control panel located in the bottom frame (control frame 
  (1)).</p> 

  <div align="center"><img alt="Figure 1" height=605  src="langfig1.gif" width=559></div>
<div align="center"><br><strong>Figure 1: Standard screen design</strong></div>

  <p>The frame-based implementation guarantees that the control panel is always 
  directly accessible. The problem of scrolling the navigation out of bounds, 
  which often occurs in longer documents on the WWW with navigational areas at 
  the top or bottom of the document, is hence avoided.</p> 
  <p>A colour coding of all different course modules simplifies the orientation 
  within a teachware package. In practice this concept is implemented through a 
  vertical colour bar on the left border of each document (3). The main course 
  chapters of a teachware package are therefore allocated a unique colour, so 
  that the learner can use this guide to always determine which part of the 
  course he or she is currently viewing. In addition the colour coding serves as 
  one building block within the extended orientation support (cf. chap. 3.4).</p> 
  <p>Longer course modules also provide jump-spots as an additional navigational 
  aid, which are located in the side menu (4) and which ensure fast access to 
  individual sections of the course module. The colour of the jump-spots 
  corresponds to the vertical colour bar of that particular module. There are 
  also other coloured jump-regions in the side menu, which provide particular 
  interaction options and are labelled as interaction-spots. Their colour coding 
  is consistent throughout the tutorial, for example red for standard 
  progression tests in form of questions and answers or blue for context 
  oriented interaction components.</p> 
  <p>At the end of each course module you find information about the author and 
  the creation date.</p> 
  
  <h3>Value-added functionality</h3>
  
  <p>The approach of the multimedia WWW-based 
  teachware packages relies on a principle true for all computer assisted 
  learning, that there must be a substantial difference in the electronic 
  presentation of lecture material. The implementation must do away with the 
  one-to-one conversion of paper documents, and must realize the potential for 
  added value inherent in an interactive presentation, such as dialogue 
  components and training modules.</p> 
  <p>With these requirements in mind the teachware packages are based on a 
  building block system with a variety of reusable core components, which 
  provide important functionalities and serve as a framework for the creation of 
  multimedia WWW-based teachware packages on any topic. These functionalities 
  are at the disposal of the user during the teachware session through the 
  various buttons within the control panel introduced in chapter 2.2 (see figure 
  2). Depending on the context these buttons are dynamically deactivated or made 
  available.</p>
     
  <div align="center"><img alt="Figure 2" height=180  src="langfig2.gif" width=626></div>
<div align="center"><br><strong>Figure 2: Control panel</strong></div>
  
  <p>The graphical design of the control panel, implemented in Java, operates as 
  one intuitively would expect. When clicking a button the action is 
  acknowledged through a clicking sound and a button down-state. Through this 
  audio-visual feedback the user is reassured that his or her interaction has 
  been accepted by the teachware module. Buttons that are dynamically 
  deactivated, or which are unavailable in certain contexts, are presented to 
  the user in a shaded state. A click on these buttons is neither accompanied by 
  a clicking sound nor through any change in the button state. The function of 
  each individual button is shown in the status line of the browser as the mouse 
  moves over the clickable area. The navigational buttons for instance show the 
  target course content as the mouse moves over the hotspots. The following 
  section briefly outlines the optional functionalities that can be activated 
  through the control panel.</p>
 
  <ul>
    <li>The <i>time display</i> offers two modes of operation. By default it 
    displays the current time. One click on the display reveals the time passed 
    during the current learning session. Another click makes the display revert 
    back to the current time mode. 
    <li>An integrated <i>online manual</i> offers the learner assistance with 
    the use of the teachware package, the functionalities of the core features 
    introduced here, as well as with operating the communication tools to get in 
    contact with the tutor, the technical support staff and other learners. By 
    optionally opening another browser window, the online manual can be used 
    concurrently with the teachware application. 
    <li>The <i>start button</i> allows the user at any time to return to the 
    homepage of the individual teachware package. 
    <li>A Java-applet is provided to <i>simplify the navigation</i> within the 
    hierarchically structured information of the teachware package. The applet 
    which is part of the control panel, has three buttons, up, next and 
    previous, the latter being of particular importance, discussed in chapter 
    3.3. 
    <li>Within a multimedia WWW-based teachware package essentially two methods 
    are used as an orientation guide. First, a <i>colour coding</i> is applied 
    to the course materials, arranged according to a hierarchical system. 
    Second, dynamically updated <i>tables of contents</i> for the individual 
    chapter and the whole course can be switched on and off in a separate frame 
    by using two corresponding buttons on the control panel. This approach 
    enables the learner to always easily determine his or her exact position 
    within the course without leaving the guided tour. A detailed description of 
    the concept behind this course of action is given in chapter 3.4. 
    <li>The <i>glossary</i>, which is subdivided into three levels, is always 
    available to the learner to access definitions of unclear terms without 
    having to go through any search procedures. Additional external resources 
    from the WWW are easily linked into the package if needed. The glossary can 
    be reached not only through the button in the control panel but also through 
    certain terms within the package that are hyperlinked to it. This mechanism 
    can compensate for different levels of prior knowledge among the learners. 
    Users with a higher level of proficiency are not distracted by lengthy 
    definitions which to them are superfluous and would disturb the flow of 
    reading. Learners with less knowledge are only one mouseclick away from the 
    definition of unclear terms in the glossary. For an in depth study of 
    sources and literature in support of a specific area of interest, one could 
    imagine an interface to an <i>electronic library</i>. 
    <li>An <i>annotation pad</i> gives the learner the opportunity to take 
    individual notes on each chapter, which can also be accessed out of context 
    during a subsequent session with the corresponding teachware package. 
    <li>During the online use of a teachware package in a distributed network 
    based teaching and learning environment the learner must always be able to 
    <i>contact a tutor and the supporting technical staff</i> through integrated 
    media channels [3]. This enables the learner to receive help and to jointly 
    find solutions to content related problems. Some interfaces for this type of 
    feedback and interaction are already tied into the teachware package - 
    reachable via the control panel - to use WWW-based synchronous and 
    asynchronous communication tools, while the integration of others is 
    anticipated. These mechanisms for interaction range from pre-addressed email 
    forms over bulletin boards and whiteboard tools to shared application and 
    videoconferencing systems. 
    <li><i>Multilateral communication</i> among geographically distributed 
    learners in an online course is realized. One of the tools provided is a 
    multimedia WWW-based bulletin board system, accessible via a button in the 
    control panel. In this forum for asynchronous discussion the tutor can 
    create closed user groups, within which learners can jointly solve problems 
    without the feeling of being observed by a third party. An additional 
    feature of the system is its support of multimedia elements, for instance 
    recorded audio contributions or video clips, which permits asynchronous 
    communication not only on a textual level. </li></ul>
	
  <h2>Implementation</h2>
  
 <p> The multimedia WWW-based teachware packages are 
  <i>implemented entirely in HTML, Java, JavaScript and WWW-compatible media 
  formats</i>, with no CGI processes taking place. This provides the means for 
  online use on the Internet and Intranet but also allows for offline use via 
  CD-ROM. The only prerequisite for the use of the teachware packages is a 
  Java-compatible browser as a front end, with no additional applications or 
  plug-ins to be installed and configured.</p> 
  <p>The teachware packages are based on a series of modular reusable 
  components, which provide core functionalities and serve as a framework for 
  developing WWW-based teachware packages with any type of content. In 
  particular teaching material which is being produced within a teleteaching and 
  telelearning context is frequently (re)used in WWW-based teachware packages. 
  This teaching material consists of excerpts from lecture video recordings, 
  corresponding digitized blackboard snapshots and overhead transparencies, as 
  well as of contents from multimedia presentations, electronic lecture notes, 
  excerpts from the course textbooks, exercises etc. In addition, computer 
  animation, textual, visual and audio components are added and external 
  supplementary WWW resources for an online use are linked. The integration of 
  these components, such as navigational guides, or a quiz applet as an 
  interaction module for progression testing, does not require any changes Java 
  or JavaScript program code.</p> 
  <p>The respective course author's tasks only include the subdivision of 
  available electronic learning materials into suitable course modules and the 
  integration of the materials into HTML documents, as well as linking the 
  contents of the course to the supporting components outlined above, taking 
  into account their specific advantages (i. e. navigational guidance, 
  possibility of annotation, progression tests etc.) within the respective 
  teachware package. </p>
  <h2>Flexible navigational and orientation guides</h2>
  
  <h3>Discussion</h3>
  
  <p>Hypertext systems such as the WWW are based on the idea of 
  subdividing the bulk of information on one type of subject into individual 
  information units (knots) which are interconnected to yield a networked type 
  of structure. Within this arrangement the user can freely explore the 
  information surrounding a certain subject, where the degree of freedom of 
  navigation depends on the organisation of the hypertext. Building on this 
  concept, unstructured hypertext allows for a flexible exploration of the 
  information within. Hypertext which is structured hierarchically, linear or in 
  matrix form curtails this freedom of navigation, yet offers the means for an 
  unaccustomed user of keeping a good sense of perspective.</p>
   
  <p>The advantages inherent in a user determined exploration of course content 
  are compromised by significant orientation problems on behalf of the learner. 
  These occur when the user has difficulties while determining his or her exact 
  position within the information presented, or is not able to locate certain 
  information. These problems are often linked with difficulties in visualising 
  the overall structure of the hypertext.</p> 
  <p>Besides the latent danger of disorientation, hypertext systems are often 
  associated with problems of cognitive overload. The latter results from the 
  fact that the learner must utilize additional mental capacity to realize the 
  available possibilities of navigation, which information has already been 
  dealt with and which information remains subject to exploration etc. [11]. 
  When realizing WWW-based teachware packages the design and implementation of 
  flexible navigational and orientation guides are crucial. On the one hand the 
  learner should always be able to determine his or her current position within 
  the presented information (<i>orientation capability</i>). On the other hand, 
  the user should at any time recognize the available navigational options, and 
  be able to easily locate information, which is known to be part of the 
  teachware package (<i>navigation capability</i>).</p> 
  <h3>Structure of course materials</h3>
  
  <p>With an unstructured presentation of 
  information one can rarely get a perspective of the subject area, which 
  hinders the search for individual information and orientation within the 
  available material. When creating WWW-based teachware packages, the course 
  materials are generally structured in a hierarchical manner. In order to 
  facilitate the navigation for unaccustomed hypertext-users and to present the 
  individual course modules which are based on each other way, the hierarchical 
  structure is supplemented by a linear guided tour. This path then encompasses 
  all the electronic chapters of a teachware package.</p> 
  <p>The potential inherent in the hypertext concept of the WWW is utilized by 
  cross linking information within the package and by linking to external 
  resources on the Internet. Figure 3 shows the basic structure of a WWW-based 
  teachware package.</p>

  <p>One could envisage an extension of the chosen structure to incorporate 
  additional guided tours, which would for instance be able to accommodate the 
  different levels of knowledge among users. Furthermore a flexible generation 
  of paths is conceivable, which would adapt to the knowledge level of the 
  learner in the course of the teachware use. To achieve this one could either 
  predefine a diverging system of learning paths, or one could generate an 
  individual learning path „on the fly" using knowledge based methods [8]. With 
  the approach chosen for multimedia WWW-based teachware packages, a single 
  linear guided tour is thought to be sufficient, as different knowledge levels 
  are accommodated by optionally skipping one chapter and through the efficient 
  and simple mechanisms of locating information.</p>
   
  <p>The definition of a guided tour as the basis of navigational support within 
  WWW-based teachware packages differs from related research work as described 
  in [2], [4] and [5]. In particular the complete absence of CGI techniques is a 
  new approach, hence removing the need for any client-server interaction. The 
  CGI interactions are replaced by a client side Java/JavaScript implementation 
  which not only offers better performance, but also allows for the offline 
  operation of the teachware package using file protocol interactions.</p>
   
  <h3>Navigational guides</h3>
  
 <p> In principle the course content may be experienced 
  in two ways. First, through unstructured exploration, looking at the table of 
  contents, overview pages and by following links to more information within the 
  teachware package (<i>user determined presentation</i>). Second, by using the 
  <i>next</i> button to follow the predefined guided tour step by step 
  (<i>system determined presentation</i>). In the context of this second 
  approach the <i>previous</i> button allows the user to go back one step on the 
  guided tour, whereas the <i>up</i> button brings the user to the root of the 
  hierarchically preceding course module. If the user initially decides to use 
  the system determined presentation, but leaves the predefined path, for 
  instance to follow links and cross-references to supplementary external 
  resources on the WWW (<i>composite type presentation</i>), he or she can 
  always directly return to the last viewed chapter of the online course by 
  using the <i>previous</i> button.</p>
   
  <p>Figure 4 shows a schematic representation of the navigation guides within a 
  composite type presentation: If the user selects a link to an external source 
  of information on the WWW, the learner is alerted that he or she is about to 
  leave the guided tour of the teachware package (1). At this point the user has 
  the option to return to the guided tour by pressing the <i>previous</i> button 
  (2a), or to follow the external link (2b). If the learner at this point 
  chooses the latter option, the information is loaded from the WWW into the 
  information frame without relinquishing the functionality of the control panel 
  which is preserved in the adjacent control frame. Within the external sources 
  of information on the WWW the user can follow any other links (3). By using 
  the <i>previous</i> button he or she can always directly return to the last 
  chapter within the guided tour of the teachware package (4), without having to 
  use browser specific aides, such as multiple clicks on the "back" button.</p>

  <div align="center"><br><strong>Figure 4: Example of navigational guidance</strong></div>
  
  <p>This functionality, referred to as <i>guided tour support,</i> is available 
  in all situations, open to a departure from the predetermined path, i. e., 
  when looking up terms in the glossary or when consulting the online manual.</p> 
  <h2>Orientation guides</h2>
  
<p>  To avoid the problem of disorientation within the 
  course material, WWW-based teachware packages are structured hierarchically, 
  with colour coded main chapters. A colour bar, displayed on the left side of 
  each page, indicates the association of each unit with a certain chapter (cf. 
  chap. 2.2). Since despite all these efforts a disorientation of the user 
  cannot be completely ruled out, a supplementary orientation concept was 
  implemented which is accessible via two buttons in the control panel. Figure 5 
  demonstrates the possible course of action taken by the user to determine the 
  current location.</p> 
  <center>
  <div align="center"><img alt="Figure 5"  height=420 src="langfig5.gif" width=700></div>
  <div align="center"><br><strong>Figure 5: Example of orientation guidance</strong></div>
  
  <p>A schematic yet detailed view of the current chapter is shown in a separate 
  frame via the chapter-content button (1). Below the entries the headline of 
  the current unit within the chapter is displayed (2). At the top of the 
  chapter content listing the name of the current chapter is noted. This in term 
  corresponds to an entry in the schematic view of the entire course structure 
  (3), which is accessible by clicking on the overall-content button (4). Based 
  on these interconnections the structure of all the information that is 
  available immediately becomes transparent, thus allowing the user to always 
  determine his exact position. By using frame technology this approach does not 
  require the user to leave the guided tour.</p>
   
  <h2>Summary and outlook</h2>
  
 <p> An evaluation of the introduced approach to 
  multimedia WWW-based teachware packages in an open environment of teaching, 
  learning and co-operation is taking place at the University of 
  Erlangen-Nuremberg during the 1997 summer semester. The goal is to examine the 
  integration of a WWW-based course into the regular curriculum. In order to 
  achieve this, 60 students will be given access to a teachware package as part 
  of a business information systems seminar, containing various multimedia 
  teaching materials from different lectures at the University of 
  Erlangen-Nuremberg. This teachware package will be employed to impart basic 
  knowledge in the field of Internet and WWW related technologies. The 
  participants will have three weeks to interact with the teachware package at 
  their individual pace and without being restricted to a certain location, to 
  gain the fundamental knowledge in the subject being dealt with. During this 
  period of time the participants can make use of the bulletin board system 
  outlined above, where the tutor acts as a coach moderating the entries on the 
  board. The tutor and the development team of the teachware package are always 
  available for questions regarding content, technology and ergonomy, through 
  asynchronous communication tools and also via synchronous videoconferencing 
  and groupware tools during certain office hours. In this scenario the 
  teachware package acts as the basis for a conventional face-to-face lecture 
  series, where the knowledge acquired is discussed in depth. In addition, the 
  application of this knowledge in a business related context is dealt with.</p>
   
  <p>The positive feedback to this prototype framework for multimedia WWW-based 
  teachware packages - award winning in this year's software competition 
  "Multimedia Transfer '97" of the German Academic Software Co-operation - 
  encourages an extended evaluation beyond the boundaries of our university. An 
  evaluation of the package is planned at several German and Austrian 
  universities and colleges, as well as in companies and in the area of teacher 
  training. The interest shown by external institutions and a group of experts 
  in the field of higher education, suggests that multimedia WWW-based teachware 
  packages may not only present a suitable medium for WWW-based learning in 
  higher education, but also a means for knowledge transfer between universities 
  and external interest groups. Areas of application are conceivable within 
  companies, in research institutes, in private and public educational 
  institutions as well as for private individuals, who are required to face the 
  challenge of lifelong learning.</p>
   
  <p>Furthermore the development of additional reusable components for 
  multimedia WWW-based teachware packages is planned. Particular emphasis will 
  be placed on the development of Java-based interactive components as well as 
  on an extended navigation support with graphical overviews and an adaptive 
  approach.</p> 
  <p>Finally the reusability of the WWW-based course modules and content is 
  considered a very important issue. The aim is to create a set of tools, which 
  allows the tutor to easily combine teaching materials already present on the 
  WWW, forming individual courses with any type of content.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We are in an era of a rapidly expanding number and diversity of systems for
organizing information. Wikis, collaborative tagging systems and semantic Web
applications represent broad categories of just a few emerging frameworks for
storing, creating, and accessing information. As each new kind of information
system appears, it is important to understand how it relates to other kinds of
system. This understanding allows us to answer a variety of important
questions, which will shape the way future systems are designed. Does
the new system represent a less expensive way to achieve the same functionality
as another? Might it be fruitfully combined with another approach? How similar
is it to an exemplar in its domain?</p>

<p>In addition to deriving theoretical answers to questions at the level of the
kind of system, such as, How does social tagging relate to professional
indexing? (<a href="#fei06">Feinberg 2006</a>; <a href="#ten06">Tennis
2006</a>) or, How do the ontologies of computer science relate to the
classifications of library and information science?, as addressed by Soergel
(<a href="#soe99">1999</a>), it is also now of practical importance to find
answers to specific instance-level questions. For example, Al-Khalifa
and Davis (<a href="#alk07">2007</a>) attempt to answer the question, How do
the tags provided by <a href="http://delicious.com/" target="_blank">Delicious</a> users relate
to the terms extracted by the Yahoo indexing algorithm over the same documents?
and Morrison (<a href="#mor08">2008</a>) asks, How do the results of searches
performed on social tagging systems compare to those performed on full Web
search engines? Answers to such questions provide vital knowledge to system
designers, because, in the age of the Web, information systems do not operate
in isolation from one another. It is both possible and beneficial to integrate
components of different systems to create symbiotic aggregates that meet the
needs of specific user groups better than any single system could, and doing so
depends upon the knowledge of how the different systems relate. Would Yahoo
automatic indexing be improved through incorporation of indexes provided by
Delicious users? Comparative analyses of the components of the two systems
can help tell us.</p>

<p>Both comparative studies of information systems in the abstract and efforts
to design specific instances of new integrative systems can benefit from
mechanisms that help to identify the specific similarities and differences that
obtain between different systems. One facet of this is empirical, reproducible,
quantitative methods of investigation. To inform both kinds of enquiry,
empirical protocols that allow for reproducible, quantitative comparison would
be beneficial. However, the term <em>information system</em> covers a vast
and ill-defined set of things, each of which is composed of many complex
components operating together in many different contexts to achieve a variety
of different purposes. To conduct useful empirical comparisons of such systems,
1) hypotheses must be evaluated in light of the many contributing qualitative
factors, and 2) reproducible metrics must be devised that can be used to test
assumptions. While qualitative interpretations of the differences that hold
between different kinds of information system continue to advance, there are
few practical, reproducible metrics defined for use in empirical comparisons of
system components. </p>

<p>Our broad goal in this work is to define a set of measurements, which can be
taken of information systems, that are meaningful, widely applicable, and
reproducible. The specific set of metrics introduced here do not intend nor
pretend to be exhaustive nor definitive, in fact, we suggest that is not an
attainable goal given the complexity of the systems under scrutiny. Rather, we
advance them as an early set of candidates in what we expect will be a broad
pool of metrics, which will continue to expand and be refined indefinitely. In
light of these goals, the metrics defined here are meant for the
characterization of one key component common to the vast majority of
information systems in current operation, the language used to index the
resources of interest within the system.</p>

<p>Zhang (<a href="#zha06">2006:121</a>) defines an indexing language as
&lsquo;<em>the set of terms used in an index to represent topics or features of
documents and the rules for combining or using those terms</em>&rsquo;. As the
emphasis here is on empirical observation and many of the information systems
under consideration offer little or no rules for the application nor of the
construction of the terms, we will operate under the broader definition of
indexing languages as <em>sets of terms used in an index to represent topics
or features</em>. Notice that this definition spans both controlled
languages, such as institutionally maintained thesauri, and uncontrolled
languages, such as the sets of keywords generated by social tagging systems.
Examples of indexing languages, as defined here, thus include the <a
href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/disted/mesh/index.html" target="_blank">Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH) thesaurus</a>, the Gene Ontology as described by Ashburner
<em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ash00">2000</a>), and the <a href="http://www.connotea.org/" target="_blank">Connotea</a> folksonomy as described by Lund <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#lun05">2005</a>). Each of these
languages, though varying in relational structure, purpose, and application, is
composed of a set of terms that represent aspects of the resources within the
information systems that utilize them. Through comparisons of the features of
these indexing languages, we hope to start work that will eventually allow us
insight that will enable us to gain a better understanding not just of the
relations between the languages, but, through them, of the relations between
the systems that generate and use them.</p>

<p>In this work, we advance an approach to the automated, quantitative
characterization of indexing languages through metrics based simply on the sets of
terms used to represent their concepts. These metrics are divided into two
groups, intra-set and inter-set. The intra-set metrics provide views on the
shape of the sets of terms in aggregate. The inter-set metrics provide a
coherent approach to the direct comparison of the overlaps between different
term sets. The paper is divided into two main sections. The first
section describes each of the metrics in detail and the second presents the
results from a quantitative comparison of twenty-two different indexing
languages. Results are provided for each language individually, using the
intra-set metrics, and for each language pair, using the inter-set metrics. In
addition to the broad all-against-all comparison, we present a more detailed
exploration of the similarities and differences, revealed using the proposed
metrics, that hold between controlled and uncontrolled indexing languages. </p>

<h2>Metrics for comparing term sets</h2>

<p>In this work we focus on the set of terms used to represent the concepts
that compose indexing languages. Relationships between the terms or the
concepts that they represent are not analysed at this stage because some
languages, such as many folksonomies, do not display the explicitly defined
relationship structures present in other forms, such as thesauri and
ontologies. This view allows us to produce metrics that are applicable to a
broad array of different indexing languages and can serve as the foundation for
future efforts that expand the comparative methodology. In the following
section, we identify a group of specific, measurable characteristics of term
sets. From these we can measure similarities and differences between indexing
languages based on quantifiable characteristics that they all share. </p>

<h3>Intra-term set measures</h3>

<p>Measurements taken at the level of the set define what might be termed the
shape of the term set. Such features of a term set include its size,
descriptive statistics regarding the lengths of its terms, and the degree of
apparent modularity present in the set. Measures of modularity expose the
structure of the term set based on the proportions of multi-word terms and the
degrees of sub-term re-use. These measures of modularity include two main
categories, Observed Linguistic Precoordination and Compositionality. </p>

<p>Observed Linguistic Precoordination indicates whether a term appears to be a union of multiple terms based
on syntactic separators. For example, the MeSH term
<strong><em>Fibroblast Growth Factor</em></strong> would be observed to be a linguistic
precoordination of the terms <strong><em>Fibroblast</em></strong>, <strong><em>Growth</em></strong>
and <strong><em>Factor</em></strong> based on the presence of spaces between the terms. As
explained in Tables <a href="#tab1">1</a> and <a href="#tab2">2</a>, we
categorize terms as uniterms (one term), duplets (combinations of two terms),
triplets (combinations of three terms) or quadruplets or higher (combinations
of four or more terms). Using these categorizations, we also record the
flexibility of a term set as the fraction of sub-terms (the terms that are used
to compose duplets, triplets, and quadplus terms) that also appear as uniterms.</p>

<p>The Observed Linguistic Precoordination measurements described here were adapted from term-set
characteristics, originally identified by Van Slype (<a
href="#van76">1976</a>), for gauging the quantifiable features of a thesaurus.
Van Slype developed and used these metrics in the process of suggesting
revisions to the ISO standard based on
comparisons of the attributes of a sample of thesauri to the prescriptions of
the standard. Our intent in using these, and related, metrics is to make it
possible to explore the consequences of adding a similar, empirical aspect to
studies of modern indexing languages. </p>

<p>The Observed Linguistic Precoordination measures were extended with related measures of compositionality as
introduced by Ogren <em>et al</em>. (<a href="#ogr04">2004</a>).
Compositionality measures include a) the number of terms that contain another
complete term as a proper substring, b) the number of terms that are contained
by another term as a proper substring, c) the number of different complements
used in these compositions, and d) the number of different compositions created
with each contained term. A complement is a sub-term that is not itself an
independent member of the set of terms. For example, the term set containing
the two terms {<em>macrophage</em>, <em>derived from macrophage</em>}
contains one complement, <em>derived from</em>. A composition is a
combination of one term from the term set with another set of terms (forming
the suffix and/or the prefix to this term) to form another term in the set. For
example, in the Academic Computing Machinery subject listing, the term
<em>software program verification</em> contains three sub-terms that are
also independent terms (<em>software</em>, <em>program</em>, and
<em>verification</em>). According to our definition, this term would be
counted as three compositions: <em>software</em>+suffix,
prefix+<em>program</em>+suffix, prefix+<em>verification</em>. As
another example, the term <em>denotational semantics</em> would only
result in one composition because <em>semantics</em> is an independent
term while <em>denotational</em> is not (and thus is a complement as
defined above).</p>

<p>Modularity is indicative of the <em>factors</em> that go into the semantics
of a term set, and shape its use. Here we are guided by Soergel's rubric
from concept description and semantic factoring. He tells us,</p> 

<blockquote>...we may note that often conceptual structure is reflected in linguistic structure; often
multi-word terms do designate a compound concept, and the single terms
designate or very nearly designate the semantic factors. Example: Steel pipes =
steel:pipes [demonstrating the factoring] (<a href="#soe74">Soergel
1974:75</a>). </blockquote>

<p>The relative presence or absence of modular structure within a
term set thus provides some weak indication of its conceptual structure. For
example, even though an indexing language may not explicitly declare
relationships between its terms, semantic relationships may sometimes be
inferred between terms that share, for example, common sub-terms (<a
href="#ogr04">Ogren <em>et al</em>. 2004</a>). The potential to detect
re-usable semantic factors that may be indicators of semantic structure within
a term set makes modularity metrics important axes for the comparison of
different term sets. </p>

<p>Together, these measurements combine to begin to form a descriptive picture
of the shape of the many diverse term sets used in indexing languages. Table <a
href="#tab3">3</a> lists and provides brief definitions for all of the term set
measurements taken.</p>

<h3>Inter-term set measures</h3>

<p>The descriptions of term set shape described above are useful in that they
can be applied to any set of terms independently and because they provide
detailed descriptions of the term sets, but, from the perspective of
comparison, more direct methods are also applicable. To provide a more exact
comparison of the compositions of sets of terms used in different languages, we
suggest several simple measures of set similarity. Each of the measures is a
view on the relation between the size of the intersection of the two term sets
and the relative sizes of each set. The members of the intersection are
determined through exact string matches applied to the term sets (after a
series of syntactic normalization operations). As depicted in Figure <a
href="#fig1">1</a> and explained below, these intersections are used to produce
measures of precision, Recall, and Overlap (the F-measure). </p>

<h4>Context considerations in inter-set comparisons</h4>

<p>The equivalence function used when conducting direct set comparisons of the
components of different indexing languages is important. In this preliminary
work, we rely on the simplistic notion that a term in one indexing language is
equivalent to a term in another language if and only if, after syntactic
normalization, the terms are identical. Synonymy, hyponymy and polysemy are not
considered and, thus, the measured overlaps are purely syntactic. When
considering indexing languages used in similar contexts; for example, as might
be indicated when two different languages are used to index the same set of
documents by similar groups of people, this function provides useful
information because the same words are likely to be used for similar purposes.
However, the greater the difference in context of application between the
indexing languages being compared, the greater the danger that this simple
function will not yield relevant data. Logical extensions of this work would
thus be to make use of semantic relations, for example of synonymy, present
within the indexing languages, as well as natural language processing
techniques, to develop additional equivalence functions that operate on a more
semantic level. That being said, with or without such extensions, any empirical
comparison should always be interpreted in light of the contexts within which
the different indexing languages operate.</p>

<h4>Quantifying set similarity</h4>

<p>Once methods for assessing the equivalence relationship are established
(here post-normalization string matching), it is possible to quantify the
relations between the resultant sets in several different ways. For example,
Al-Khalifa and Davis (<a href="#alk07">2007</a>) find what they term
<em>percentage overlap</em> by dividing the size of the intersection of the two sets
by the size of the union of the sets and multiplying by 100. They use this
measure to quantify the similarity of the sets of terms used to index the same
documents produced by different indexing systems. For example, to find the
percentage overlap between the set F {A,B,C} and the set K{A,G,K,L} , the size
of the intersection {A} is 1, the size of their union {A,B,C,G,K,L} is 6 and
thus the percentage overlap is 100(1/6)= 17%.</p>

<p>While a useful measurement, this equation misses key information regarding
the relative sizes of the two sets.  To capture the size
discrepancies and the asymmetry of the relationship, we employ additional
metrics typically used to evaluate class prediction algorithms. </p>

<p>Binary class prediction algorithms are often evaluated on the basis of
relations between sets of true and false positive and negative predictions (<a
href="#wit00">Witten &amp; Frank 2000</a>). These relations are quantified with
measures of Accuracy, precision and Recall. Accuracy is the number of correct
predictions divided by the number of false predictions. precision is the number
of true positives divided by the number of predicted positives. Recall is the
number of true positives divided by the number of both true and false
positives. precision and Recall are often summarized with the F-measure, which
equates to their harmonic mean. </p>

<p>Hripcsak and Rothschild (<a href="#hri05">2005</a>) showed that, by
arbitrarily assigning one set as the <em>true positives</em> and the other
as the <em>predicted positives</em>, the F-measure can be used to measure
the degree of agreement between any two sets. Because it is commutative, the
choice of which set to assign as <em>true</em> makes no difference to the
outcome. Figure <a href="#fig1">1</a> illustrates the idea of using precision,
Recall, and the F-measure as generic set comparison operators. The logic goes
as follows, if set A is conceptualized as an attempt to predict set B, the
number of items in both sets (the intersection) corresponds to the number of
true positives for the predictor that produced A; the number of items in A
corresponds to the number of true positives plus the number of false positives;
and the number of items in B corresponds to the number of true positives plus
the number of false negatives. From this perspective, accuracy thus equates to
percentage overlap as described by Al-Khalifa and Davis (<a
href="#alk07">2007</a>). In addition, precision and Recall can be used for the
asymmetric quantification of the similarity of the two sets and the F-measure
can be used to provide a symmetric view of the overlap between the sets that
takes into account their relative sizes.</p>

<h2>Demonstration and evaluation of proposed metrics</h2>

<p>The metrics described above are intended to be useful in scientific
enquiries regarding the relationships that hold between different indexing
languages. This information, in turn,  should then be useful in informing
assumptions about the relationships between the information systems that
generate and use these languages. As such, it should be possible to use the
metrics to answer specific questions. We chose the following questions as
demonstrative examples:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Are the intra-set characteristics of the folksonomies emerging from
collaborative tagging systems sufficient to distinguish them from term sets
associated with indexing languages created using professional labour? (We
assume that the difference in kind between these groups will be expressed
in a difference in shape as expressed in the intra-set measures.)</li>
  <li>How much direct overlap exists between terms from the <em>Connotea</em>,
Bibsonomy, and <em>CiteULike</em> folksonomies, and terms from MeSH? These
folksonomies are used to describe tens of thousands of the same resources
as MeSH, hence we expect some overlap in representation, but how much is
there in reality?</li>
</ol>

<p>To answer these questions and thus demonstrate example applications of the
proposed set of metrics, we implemented programs that calculate each intra- and
inter-set metric described above. In the text that follows, we describe the
application of these programs to the automated characterization and comparison
of twenty-two different indexing languages. </p>

<h3>Sample</h3>

<p>We gathered a sample of twenty-two different term sets. The terms were extracted
from folksonomies, thesauri, and ontologies, all of which are currently in
active use. Our domains span biology, medicine, agriculture, and computer
science; however, the sample set is biased towards biology and medicine.
Ontologies constitute the most common type of structure in the sample simply
because more of them were accessible than the other forms, Table <a
href="#tab4">4</a> lists the subjects of the study (note that there are more
than twenty-two listed because multiple versions for some of the larger term sets were
considered separately).</p>

<p>The indexing languages considered here were chosen for three general
reasons: (1) they were freely available on the Web, (2) most of the terms
associated with the indexing languages had representations in English and (3)
we sought popular examples spanning both controlled and uncontrolled indexing
languages. Availability on the Web not only made data collection for the
present study easier, it increases the likelihood that the study could be
repeated by others in the future. By constraining the natural language of
origin for the indexing languages under study, the likelihood that the measured
differences between term sets were the results of factors aside from
differences in, for example, typical grammatical structure of the source
languages, was increased. Finally, by sampling from a broad range of the known
types of indexing language, as suggested, for example, in the typology of
Tudhope (<a href="#tud06">2006</a>), we hoped to show the generic nature of the
metrics introduced here and to offer some basic exploratory comparisons of the
broad groups of controlled and uncontrolled languages. </p>

<p>Although we provide results for all of the inter-term set comparisons, the
emphasis of the set comparisons is on the relationship between MeSH and the
uncontrolled indexing languages. To partially decrease the problems, noted
above, associated with conducting syntactic comparisons of indexing languages
operating in different contexts, uncontrolled languages were sought that were
used to index many of the same documents as MeSH. Folksonomies emanating from
social tagging services targeted towards academic audiences thus compose the
set of uncontrolled languages in the sample. </p>

<h3>Data analysis</h3>

<p>Once each of the term sets was collected (see <a href="#app1">Appendix
1</a>), two levels of term normalization were applied corresponding to the
intra-set analysis (phase 1) and the inter-set analysis (phase 2). Both phases
were designed based on the premise that most of the terms in the structures
were English words. Though there were certainly some non-English terms present
in the folksonomy data, notably German and Spanish, these terms constituted a
relatively small minority of the terms in the set and, as such, we do not
believe they had any significant effect on the results.</p>

<h4>Phase 1 term normalization</h4>

<p>Phase 1 normalization was designed primarily to help consistently delineate
the boundaries of compound words, especially in the case of the folksonomies.
The operations were:</p>
<ol>
  <li>All non-word characters (for example, comma, semi-colon, underline and hyphen) were mapped to
spaces using a regular expression. So the term
<em>automatic-ontology_evaluation</em> would become <em>automatic
ontology evaluation</em>.</li>
  <li>CamelCase compound words were mapped to space separated words:
<em>camelCase</em> becomes <em>camel case</em>.</li>
  <li>All words were made all lower case (<em>case-folded</em>).</li>
  <li>Any redundant terms were removed such that, after operations 1-3, each
term in a set composed a string of characters that was unique within that
set.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of the intra-set measurements (Size and Flexibility for example) were
taken after Phase 1 normalization. Phase 2 normalization was applied before the
set-intersection computations (for the inter-set measurements).</p>

<h4>Phase 2 term normalization</h4>

<p>Phase 2 normalization was intended to reduce the effects of uninformative
inconsistencies such as <em>dolphins</em> not matching
<em>dolphin</em> when estimating the intersections of the term sets.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Phase 1 normalization was applied.</li>
  <li>Porter stemming was applied to all terms and sub-terms (<a
href="#por80">Porter 1980</a>).</li>
  <li>All sub-terms were sorted alphabetically.</li>
  <li>All terms and sub-terms with less than two characters were removed.</li>
  <li>All terms and sub-terms matching words from a popular English stop-word
list were removed (<a href="#ran08">Default... 2008</a>)</li>
</ol>

<p>These additional steps resulted in an average reduction in the total number
of distinct terms per term set of 13% with the most substantial difference seen
for the <em>MeSH all</em> term set, which included both the preferred
labels for each descriptor and all of the alternate labels, at 52%. The set of
just the preferred labels for the MeSH descriptors was only reduced by 3%. This
demonstrates that the normalization step was successful in reducing redundancy
within the term sets because the <em>MeSH all</em> set intentionally
includes many variations of the same term while the preferred labels are
intended to be distinct. Figure <a href="#fig2">2</a> plots the reduction in
the (non-redundant) term set size between phase 1 and phase 2 normalization for
all the term sets.</p>

<strong>Figure 2: The effect of phase 2 normalization on the size of the term
set</strong><br />
(For each term set, the chart displays the ratio of its size after phase 2
normalization versus its size after phase 1 normalization.)</div>

<p>After normalization, the shape of each of the term sets was first assessed
individually using the intra-set measures. Then each of the term sets was
compared directly to all others using the inter-set metrics. </p>

<h2>Intra-set findings</h2>

<p>The intra-set measures displayed a broad range of diversity across all of
the samples and provided some preliminary evidence of the presence of distinct
shapes associated with term sets originating from controlled versus
uncontrolled information organization structures. The collected measurements
are provided in Tables 5 to 7 and discussed below. </p>

<p>Table <a href="#tab5">5</a> contains the non-ratio measurements of the size
and the composition of the term sets. From it, we can see that there is a wide
range in the size and degrees of modularity of the term sets under study. The
largest term set was the <a href="http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a>
folksonomy at 234,223 terms and the smallest was the Common Anatomy Reference
ontology (<a href="#hae08">Haendel <em>et al</em>. 2008</a>) at just fifty terms.
There was also substantial variation in the total number of Observed Linguistic Precoordination sub-terms per
term, with the CHEBI ontology (<a href="#deg08">Degtyarenko <em>et al</em>.
2008</a>) averaging 8.88 while the <a
href="http://www.bibsonomy.org/">Bibsonomy</a> folksonomy averaged just 0.63.
This is suggestive of differences in the relative compositionality of the
different term sets, with the ontologies being much more modular in general
than the folksonomies. </p>

<p>The sub-terms per term measurement highlights the uniqueness of the CHEBI
ontology within the context of our sample; its terms include both
normal language constructs like <em>tetracenomycin F1 methyl
ester</em> and chemical codes like  <em>methyl
3,8,10,12-tetrahydroxy-1-methyl-11-oxo-6,11-dihydrotetracene-2-carboxylate</em>.
Although both term structures are highly modular in this large ontology, the
latter are clearly driving the very high observed mean number of sub-terms per
term. </p>

<p>Table <a href="#tab6">6</a> focuses specifically on illustrating the amount
of modularity apparent in these term sets. It displays the percentages of
uniterms, duplets, triplets, and quadplus terms; the flexibility, and the
percentages of terms that contain other terms or are contained by other terms.
The <em>CiteULike</em> folksonomy has the highest percentage of uniterms at 75.8%,
followed closely by the <em>Bibsonomy</em> folksonomy at 72.7%, while the two lowest
percentages are observed for the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA) (including
synonyms), described by Rosse and Mejino (<a href="#ros03">2003</a>), at 1.2%
and the Biological Process (BP) branch of the Gene Ontology, described by
Ashburner <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ash00">2000</a>) at 0.8%. This tendency
towards increased compositionality in these ontologies and decreased
compositionality in these folksonomies is also apparent in the percentage of
their terms that contain other complete terms from the structure, with more
than 95% of the FMA terms containing other FMA terms and only 23.8% of the
Bibsonomy terms containing another <em>Bibsonomy</em> term. As might be expected, larger
average term lengths, as presented in Table <a href="#tab7">7</a>, appear to
correlate to some extent with some of the measures indicating increased
compositionality. The highest correlation for a compositionality measure with
average term length was observed for Observed Linguistic Precoordination Quad Plus (r-squared 0.86) while the
lowest was for containedByAnother (r-squared 0.13). The highest mean term
length observed was 40.35 characters for the preferred labels for the FMA and
the lowest was 10.19 for the <em>Bibsonomy</em> terms. </p>

<h3>Factor analysis</h3>

<p>Following the collection of the individual parameters described above,
exploratory factor analysis was applied to the data to deduce the major
dimensions. Before executing the factor analysis, the data were pruned
manually to reduce the degree of correlation between the variables. The
features utilized in the factor analysis were thus limited to <em>percent of uniterms</em>, <em>percent of
duplets</em>, <em>percent of quadplus</em>, <em>flexibility</em>, <em>percent of containsAnother</em>, <em>percent of containedByAnother,</em> <em>mean number of sub-terms per term</em>, <em>mean term length</em>, and the <em>coefficient of variation
for term length</em>. Maximum likelihood factor analysis, as implemented in the R
statistical programming environment by the R Development Core Team (<a
href="#rde08">2008</a>), was applied using these variables for all of the
sampled term sets. Three tests were conducted with 1, 2, and 3 factors to be
fitted respectively. In each of these tests, the dominant factor, which might
be labelled <em>term complexity</em>, was associated with the variables:
<em>percent of quadplus</em>, <em>mean term length</em>, and <em>mean sub-terms per term</em>. In the 2-factor test,
the secondary factor was most associated with the <em>percent of uniterms</em> and the
<em>flexibility</em>. Finally, in the 3 factor analysis, the third factor was associated
with percent of <em>containsAnother</em> and percent <em>containedByAnother</em>. Table <a href="#tab8">8</a> provides the factor loadings for the 3-factor test. </p>

<h3>Controlled versus uncontrolled term sets</h3>

<p>The data presented in Tables 5 to 7 provide evidence that the metrics captured
here are sufficient to distinguish between term sets representing different
indexing languages. To assess their utility in quantifying differences between
indexing languages emanating from different kinds of information system, we
tested to see if they could be used to differentiate between the languages
produced by professional labour (the thesauri and the ontologies) and languages
generated by the masses (the folksonomies). </p>

<p>This examination was conducted using manual inspection of the data,
multi-dimensional visualization, and cluster analysis. At each step, we tested
to see if the data suggested the presence of a distinct constellation of
intra-set parameters associated with the term sets drawn from the folksonomies.
For some subsets of variables, the difference was obvious. For example, as
Figure <a href="#fig3">3</a> illustrates, both the <em>percent of uniterms</em> and the <em>Observed Linguistic Precoordination flexibility</em> measurements were sufficient to separate the folksonomies from the other term sets independently. For other subsets of variables, the differences
were less clear and, in some cases, the folksonomies did not group together.</p>

<p>Figures 4 to 10 use radar-charts to illustrate the shapes associated with the
three folksonomies in the sample as well as representative ontologies and
thesauri. Radar charts were chosen because they make it possible to visualize
large numbers of dimensions simultaneously. Though it would be possible to
reduce the number of features in the charts, for example using the results from
the factor analysis presented above, we chose to present all of the
measurements taken. These figures, which capture all of the features measured
for a given term set in a single image, suggest fairly distinct patterns in the
term sets associated with the different kinds of information system present in
our sample. However, when utilizing all of the variables, the borders of the
various categories are not entirely clear. For example, the <em>Bibsonomy</em> and
<em>CiteULike</em> folksonomies appear to be nearly identical in these charts but, while
similar, the <em>Connotea</em> folksonomy shows substantial variations. </p>

<p>In various iterations of cluster analysis we repeatedly found that the
<em>Bibsonomy</em> and the <em>CiteULike</em> term sets grouped tightly together and that
<em>Connotea</em> was generally similar to them but that this similarity was strongly
influenced by the specific subset of the metrics used. In one specific analysis
presented in Good &amp; Tennis (<a href="#goo08">2008</a>), Ward&rsquo;s method
identified a distinct cluster containing just the folksonomies using the
following parameters: <em>percent of uniterms</em>, <em>percent of duplets</em>, <em>flexibility</em>, <em>percent contained by another</em>, <em>standard deviation of term length</em>, <em>skewness of term length</em>, and <em>number of complements</em>. </p>

<div align="center">
<a name="fig3" id="fig3"></a><img src="p395fig3.png" alt="fig3" /><br />
<strong>Figure 3: %Uniterms verse Observed Linguistic Precoordination flexibility </strong><br />
(Either metric is sufficient to form a linear separator between the term sets
originating from folksonomies (the three in the upper right corner) and the
controlled terms from the other information organization structures in the
sample. The Pearson correlation coefficient for <em>percent of uniterms</em> and <em>Observed Linguistic Precoordination flexibility</em>
is 0.79. )</div>

<p>These results indicate that the answer to the first question, namely:
Are the terms from folksonomies shaped differently than the terms from
controlled vocabularies? is, generally, yes. Subsets of these metrics
can be used to separate folksonomies from the controlled vocabularies using a
variety of methods. However, <em>Bibsonomy</em> and <em>CiteULike</em> are clearly much more
similar to each other than either is to <em>Connotea</em>. Without advancing a
definitive answer as to why this is the case, we offer several possible
explanations. First, one clear technical difference between <em>Connotea</em> and the
other two systems is that it allows spaces in its tags. For example, it is
possible to use the tag <em>semantic Web</em> in <em>Connotea</em>, but, in
Bibsonomy or <em>CiteULike</em>, one would have to use a construct like
<em>semanticWeb</em>, <em>semantic-Web</em>, or
<em>semanticWeb</em> to express the same term. Though the syntactic
normalization we utilized will equate <em>semantic-Web</em> with
<em>semantic Web</em> (and detect the two-term composition), the term
semanticWeb would not match and would be classified by the system as a uniterm.
This difference suggests that there may be more compound terms in <em>Bibsonomy</em> and
<em>CiteULike</em> than our metrics indicate; however, this aspect of the tagging system
may also act to discourage the use of complex tags by the <em>Bibsonomy</em> and
<em>CiteULike</em> users. Aside from differences in the allowed syntax of these
uncontrolled indexing languages, this may also be an effect of the differing
communities that use these systems. While <em>Connotea</em> is clearly dominated by
biomedical researchers, <em>Bibsonomy</em> is much more influenced by computer
scientists and <em>CiteULike</em> seems to have the broadest mixture. Perhaps the
biomedical tags are simply longer and more complex than in other fields. A
final possibility, one that we will return to in the discussion of the direct
measures of term-set overlap, is that <em>Connotea</em> may be disproportionately
affected by the automatic import of terms from controlled vocabularies, in
particular MeSH, as tags within the system. </p>

<h3>Inter-set findings</h3>

<p>Following the intra-set results, the inter-set comparisons indicate high
diversity in the term sets present in the sample while also highlighting
interesting relationships between them. Figures <a href="#fig11">11</a> and <a
href="#fig12">12</a> provide an overview of the all-against-all comparison of
each of the term sets using the F-measure and the measures of precision and
recall respectively. They show that, in general, there was a very low amount of
overlap between most of the pairs that were examined. This is likely a direct
result of the wide variance of contexts associated with the diverse indexing
languages represented in the sample. Though the sample was biased towards
ontologies in the biomedical domain, biomedical is an extremely broad term. For
example, the domains of items intended to be indexed with the different
languages ranged from amino acid sequences, to biomedical citations, to tissue
samples. That there was not much direct overlap in general is unsurprising.</p>

<p>Aside from overlaps between different term sets drawn from the same
structure (e.g.,  between a version of MeSH with only the preferred labels and a
version that included all of the alternate labels), the greatest
overlap, as indicated by the F-measure, was found between the Zebrafish Anatomy
(ZFA) ontology (<a href="#spr08">Sprague <em>et al</em>. 2008</a>) and the Cell
ontology (CL) (<a href="#bar05">Bard <em>et al</em>. 2005</a>) at (f = 0.28).
This overlap results because the ZFA ontology contains a large proportion of
cell-related terms that are non-specific to the Zebrafish, such as
<em>mesothelial cell</em> and <em>osteoblast</em>. </p>

<h4>MeSH versus the folksonomies</h4>

<p>The second specific, demonstrative question put forward above, and one of
the early motivators for this project, was the question of how the terms from
MeSH compare to the terms from academic folksonomies. To answer this question,
Tables <a href="#tab10">10</a> and <a href="#tab11">11</a> delineate the
overlaps in terms of precision, recall, and the F-measure that were observed
between the three folksonomies in our sample and the MeSH thesaurus (including
one version with just the preferred labels and another that included alternate
terms). Of the three folksonomies, <em>Connotea</em> displayed the greatest degree of
overlap with MeSH in terms of the F-measure, precision, and recall for both the
preferred labels and the complete MeSH term set. The precision of the <em>Connotea</em>
terms with respect to the MeSH preferred labels was 0.073, the recall 0.363,
and the F-measure was 0.122. </p>

<p>The fact that the <em>Connotea</em> term set contains nearly 9000 MeSH terms (36% of
the entire set of preferred labels) suggests a) that there are a number of
biomedical researchers using <em>Connotea</em> and b) that they have chosen, one way or
another, to utilize MeSH terminology in the organization of their publicly
accessible resource collections. How these terms came to be used in this manner
is a more difficult question. In some cases, the <em>Connotea</em> users likely
recreated the MeSH terms when going about their normal tagging practices;
however, the relatively high level of overlap is suggestive of other underlying
factors. </p>

<h4>Batch import in folksonomies</h4>

<p><em>Connotea</em>, as well as the other social tagging systems in the study, offers a
way to import data from other sources automatically. For example, it is
possible to export bibliographic information from applications such as Endnote
and then import these records as bookmarks within the <em>Connotea</em> system. This
opens up the possibility that tags generated outside of the <em>Connotea</em> system,
such as MeSH indexing by MEDLINE, can wind up in the mix of the tags contained
within the <em>Connotea</em> folksonomy. </p>

<p>To help assess the impact of imported tags on the contents of the <em>Connotea</em>
folksonomy, we identified and removed a subset of the <em>Connotea</em> tags that were
highly likely to have been imported through the use of additional information
about the context of the creation of the tags, and then recomputed all of the
metrics defined above. In a social bookmarking system like <em>Connotea</em>, tags are
added to the system as descriptive annotations of Web resources. When a
bookmark is posted to the system by a particular user, the tags associated with
it, as well as a timestamp, are associated with the entry. Sets of bookmarks
posted via batch import, for example from the contents of an Endnote library,
will all have nearly identical timestamps associated with them. Thus, by
pruning out tags originating only in posts submitted by the same user during
the same minute, we constructed a new <em>Connotea</em> term set that should be more
representative of the terms actually typed in directly by the users. </p>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig13">13</a> shows the differences between the pruned
<em>Connotea</em> term set (Connotea_no_batch) and the original dataset on both
intra-set measures and measures of direct overlap with the MeSH preferredLabel
term set. In every metric except for the skewness of the lengths of the terms,
the pruned <em>Connotea</em> term set more closely resembled the other folksonomies. For
example, in the pruned set, the % uniterms increased by about 10%, the %
quadplus decreased by more than 30% and the flexibility increased by about 10%.
The overlap with the MeSH prefLabels decreased from 0.12 to 0.11 with respect
to the F measure, the precision decreased from 0.363 to 0.266, and the recall
decreased from 0.073 to 0.069. </p>

<strong>Figure 13: Differences between the full <em>Connotea</em> term set and <em>Connotea</em>
term set with batch uploaded bookmark posts removed </strong> </div>

<p>It appears the process of batch uploading bookmarks in <em>Connotea</em>, in
cooperation with other personal information management practices such as the
use of Endnote, has influenced the contents of the <em>Connotea</em> folksonomy. In
particular, many MeSH terms appear to have been incorporated into it. Since
most other folksonomies, including the others evaluated here, also have
automated upload capabilities, it is highly likely that similar results may be
observed within them. While this phenomenon makes the interpretation of
folksonomy datasets more complex by obscuring the origins of the data, its
illumination should provide new opportunities for investigation. For example,
perhaps it would be possible to track the migration of terms across the
boundaries of different systems through the addition of a temporal attribute to
the inter-set metrics suggested here. Such data might help to explain the
origins of the terms utilized in different indexing languages. One would assume
for example, that many of the terms that now overlap between MeSH and the
folksonomies appeared first in MeSH and then migrated over somehow; however, in
the future, perhaps this process might be reversed as folksonomies are mined
for candidate extensions to controlled vocabularies. </p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>Robust, reproducible methods for comparing different information systems are
vital tools for scientists and system developers faced with what has been
called &lsquo;<em>an unprecedented increase in the number and variety of formal and
informal systems for knowledge representation and organization</em>&rsquo; (<a
href="#ten08">Tennis &amp; Jacob 2008</a>). Indeed, we are in a Cambrian Age of
Web-based indexing languages. Metrics and tools, such as the system for
indexing language characterization described here, can be used to provide
information about how the many emerging kinds of information systems relate to
one another. It can also be used in the design of new systems that incorporate
ideas inspired by such comparisons, as suggested by the University of
California&rsquo;s Bibliographic Services Task Force (<a
href="#bib05">2005</a>), or, as demonstrated by Good <em>et al.</em> (<a
href="#goo06">2006</a>) and Willighagen <em>et al.</em> (<a
href="#wil07">2007</a>), explicitly combine multiple extant systems to form
novel hybrids.</p>

<p>In the research presented above, we introduced metrics for the automatic
characterization and set-theoretic comparison of sets of terms from indexing
languages. Using these metrics, we provided a broad-spectrum analysis of twenty-two
different languages. Within the data gathered in this exploratory analysis, we
identified suggestive patterns associated with the terms that compose
folksonomies versus the terms from controlled vocabularies as well as directly
quantifying the degree of overlap present across each of the sets in the
sample. Of particular interest is the apparent migration of terms across the
boundaries of the different systems, in particular from MeSH into the
folksonomies. Though the results presented here are informative, the main
contribution of this work is the enumeration and implementation of the
comparative protocol. </p>

<p>Future term set analyses, particularly if they can be integrated with rich
qualitative dimensions, might be put to any number of novel uses. Given the
definition of these metrics and the provision of tools for their calculation,
it would now be straightforward to test whether any of the term-based
measurements are related to other attributes of information systems. For
example, it might be interesting to test to see if any of these factors were
predictive of system performance; e.g., is the percentage of uniterms in the
tags that compose a folksonomy correlated with the performance of that
folksonomy in the context of a retrieval task? If that answer turned out to be
yes, then it would offer an easy way to estimate the retrieval performance of
different systems and might suggest ways to improve performance, for example by
adapting the tagging interface to encourage the contribution of more complex
tags. Other potential applications include: comparative quality evaluation,
term set warrant and the identification of relationships between term-set shape
and theoretical types of indexing language.</p>

<h3>Comparative quality evaluation</h3>

<p>From the perspective of systems evaluation, one particular use of the
methods defined here might be in gold-standard based quality assessments
similar to those described by Dellschaft and Staab (<a href="#del06">2006</a>)
for the automated, comparative evaluation of ontologies. If a particular
indexing language is judged to be of high quality for some particular context,
other structures might be evaluated for their quality in that or a very similar
context based on their similarity to this gold-standard. For example, for the
purpose of indexing biomedical documents for an institutional information
retrieval system like MEDLINE, many would consider MeSH as a gold standard. The
similarity of another indexing language, such as a folksonomy, to this standard
might thus be used as a measure of its quality for indexing biomedical
documents for retrieval. The principle advantage of such an approach is that it
can be completely automatic, potentially helping to avoid the intensive manual
labour and possible subjectivity associated with manual evaluations. The
disadvantages are that, for any real, new application, (a) a gold standard is
unlikely to exist and (b) any acceptable evaluation would still have to be
informed by extensive qualitative alignment of the contextual attributes of the
intended application in comparison with the gold standard. </p>

<h3>Term-set warrant</h3>

<p>The creators and maintainers of indexing languages often require
justifications for the inclusion or exclusion of classes within their
structures (<a href="#beg86">Beghtol 1986: 110-111</a>). These justifications,
referred to as warrants, may come in many forms, though the most commonly
discussed is probably <em>literary warrant</em>. Essentially a particular
kind of warrant bases the justification for the contents of an indexing
language on a particular kind of empirical evidence (e.g., user requests) or
argument (e.g., philosophical or scientific warrant). The inter-set metrics may
provide data useful in the development of a new kind of warrant based upon the
overlap between different structures. Essentially, such a <em>term-set
warrant</em> might be invoked to justify the inclusion of terms or the
concepts they represent based on the presence or absence of those terms in
other structures.</p>

<h3>Relationship of term-set shape to theoretical type</h3>

<p>It is tempting to think that this approach, or some extension of it, could
be used to describe meaningful types of indexing languages, not from design
requirements, but from the actualization of those design requirements manifest
in and observable to us in the shape of term sets. This could provide a weak
empirical corroboration for types of indexing languages in use, not only
according to standard or theory, but based on empirical evidence of term
corpus. Defending and making use of such inferences would require a solid
understanding of the meaning of the different shapes. The work presented here
is exploratory and future work will have to substantiate any claim at deriving
type from these empirical factors. However, we can see that, in this sample,
there were clear distinctions between the shapes of controlled and uncontrolled
vocabularies, demonstrating at this stage that we can hypothesize that
folksonomies have a particular shape in relation to both thesauri and
ontologies. Future studies may take advantage of the increasing number of
different indexing languages to, for example, attempt to define the
relationship of term-set shape to the breakdown of theoretical type within the
controlled vocabularies. </p>

<h2>Future work</h2>

<p>The metrics derived and applied here operate at what amounts to a syntactic
level and no specific attempt, other than rudimentary term normalization,
was made to identify the concepts present in the different indexing languages.
A natural extension of this work would be to apply natural language processing
technology to make this attempt. The rough indications of semantic similarity
provided by the inter-term set comparisons could be made much more robust if
the comparisons were made at the level of concepts rather than terms, for
example making it possible to equate synonymous terms from different languages.
</p>

<p>Aside from the incorporation of natural language processing technology for
concept identification, it would be useful to consider the analysis of
predicate relationships between the terms (e.g.,  the hierarchical structure) and
the analysis of the relationships between terms and the items they may be used
to index. Metrics that captured these additional facets of information systems,
characteristic of their form and application, would provide the opportunity for
much more detailed comparisons, thus forming the raw materials for the
derivation and testing of many new hypotheses. </p>

<p>There remain many indexing languages, both controlled and uncontrolled, that
are available online that have not been characterized with the methods and from
the naturalistic perspective adopted here. In addition to improving and
expanding methods, the majority of future work will be the application of these
tools to the analysis of other languages.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We are at the very beginning of a rapid expansion in the number and the
diversity of different frameworks for the organization of information. As more
and more information systems come into the world, the application of
expository, reproducible protocols for their comparative analysis, such as the
one described in this article, will lead to ever increasing abilities to
illuminate and thus build upon this expanding diversity of form and content.</p>

<h3>MeSH</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Files representing the 2008 release of MeSH were downloaded from <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/filelist.html">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/filelist.html</a> on 11 February 2008.</li>
  <li>The preferred labels for the terms were taken from the downloaded file 'mshd2008.txt'.</li>
  <li>The union of the preferred labels and the synonyms (mesh all) was extracted from the downloaded MeSH XML file 'desc2008' using a Java program.</li>
  <li>The MeSH terms with comma separated adjectives, like 'Cells, Immobilized', were programmatically re-ordered to reflect a more natural English language usage of adjective-noun, such as 'Immobilized Cells'. This step was taken to facilitate comparison with the other indexing languages that tended much more towards this form.</li> 
</ol>

<h3>OWL/RDF formatted thesauri and ontologies</h3>

<p>Unless otherwise, noted, all the labels for the concepts and their synonyms were extracted from the files using custom Java code built with the <a href="http://jena.sourceforge.net/">Jena OWL/RDF API</a>.</p>

<h4>ACM &ndash; Association for Computing Machinery</h4>

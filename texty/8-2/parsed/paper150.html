<h2>Introduction.</h2> 

  <p>Information professionals have long <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to comprehend what factors are relevant 
  in encouraging a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to seek out information. More recently, a particular 
  <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of inquiry has been on those factors that play a role in deciding to use 
  the library and its resources as a place to seek information (whether physically 
  or virtually) as <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to just surfing the Internet. These inquiries <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>
  an even greater importance in light of the fact that more people are using the 
  Internet to find information they need, information that is unmediated by the 
  library (<a href="#kib00">Kibirge, 2000</a>). </p>
  
<p>Informed library users know that libraries have resources that are more comprehensive 
  and scholarly than most Web sites provide. Libraries provide access to scholarly 
  literature that, as a <span>rule</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> is not freely available on the Web, or may not 
  be online at all. Often, it is in college that users become aware of libraries' 
  resources, usually while having to write research papers. Assuming that on average 
  most <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>face the same number and type of papers and assignments during 
  their college career, it is critical to understand what makes one student use 
  the library's resources (print and/or electronic) while another will not think 
  of the library as a place to find specialized resources for their papers, especially 
  in the early parts of their college careers.</p>
  
<p>One obstacle to the use of a library's resources, and in particular its electronic 
  resources, is that they are not seen as being straightforward. In contrast to 
  an Internet <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>engine, where a single keyword <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>will usually result 
  in thousands of hits, no matter what the <span>topic</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> in the library, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>have 
  to choose a particular database and be more selective in the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>words they 
  use. Moreover, database subjects often overlap, with differences in dates, journal 
  and subjects covered, and whether the material is full-text or not. In addition, 
  the library may have a print subscription to a certain title that is not full-text 
  electronically, or the title may be accessible full-text through another database 
  than the one originally searched. Therefore, not only do <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>have to find 
  the relevant citations, but they also have to know how to locate the article 
  after that. This means juggling many screens, many technologies, multi-tasking 
  electronic jobs, and of course, knowing where to look for all this necessary 
  information. Lastly, there is the additional confusion that more and more library 
  databases use Web-based technologies. Because the interface is seamless there 
  does not seem to be a visible, on the screen, difference between Web-based library 
  resources and general Web-based resources. All of the above also assumes the 
  student is proficient in the use of computers. It is quite clear that searching 
  for information has become &quot;inexorably linked to <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>technology.&quot; 
  (<a href="#jac91">Jacobson, 1991: 268</a>). </p>
  
<p>Understanding how <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>navigate this maze of resources is important in 
  helping us to develop and assess pedagogy <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to instruct our <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>
  in library usage. Students are more and more Web-savvy (<a href="#kib00">Kibirge, 2000</a>), many 
  of them having been brought up around computers and the Internet. However, they matriculate 
  with a diversity of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and Web-searching skills and experience. Students 
  may not have been exposed to library resources, or not be aware of which resources 
  a library might have, or how to make use of them. It is therefore of interest 
  to us to try and understand what <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>will make one student branch 
  out and explore library resources, while another one might not.</p>
  
<p>A study of undergraduates showed that they looked for the fastest way that 
  would lead to satisfactory results when doing research, going for electronic 
  information sources first (<a href="#val93">Valentine, 1993</a>). These <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>felt uncomfortable, 
  however, asking for help in using the library and spent frustrating hours trying 
  to find information. Currently, with the explosion of full-text resources, it 
  would seem even easier for the student to find a full-text database and select 
  the articles, regardless of whether they would have been the most appropriate 
  for their research. Not all <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>take this route, however.</p>
  
<p>In this study we will examine some factors that correlate with <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> 
  usage of the library's electronic resources. While we will examine the relationship 
  of age and gender to usage, we will also <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on the concept of self-efficacy, 
  a <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>s belief in their ability to attain desired outcomes (<a href="#ban97">Bandura, 
  1997</a>). </p>

  <h2>Background Research</h2>
  
<p>This section is an overview of research conducted on usage of library's electronic 
  resources and examines self-efficacy as applied to academic settings. </p>
  
<h3>Students’ Demographics</h3>

<p>Demographics often yield important clues as to what factors contribute to undergraduates' 
  use of electronic resources. <a href="#whi01a">Whitmire</a> (2001a) found that 
  there was a correlation between background <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>such as gender, race, 
  and initial critical thinking scores and library use during the freshmen and 
  sophomore years, although these played less of an important role in the junior 
  year. An interesting predictor of college library use was the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to which 
  these <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>used the library while in high <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#whi01a">Whitmire, 
  2001a</a>). </p>

<h4>Age</h4>
  
<p>Age is one variable that correlates with comfort with computers and use of 
  electronic resources. Younger <span>generations</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>have been brought up with computers; many 
  do not even remember a time when computers were not around. Older and returning 
  <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>may not have had as much <span>exposure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to computers, resulting in increased 
  <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>anxiety. For example, Laguna and Babcock found that, &quot;...there were significant age differences on the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>task, as <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by older adults making fewer correct decisions and <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>longer to make their decisions than younger adults.&quot; (<a href="#lag97">Laguna 
  and Babcock, 1997:323</a>). Studies have also found that the more <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>experience 
  people have, the less anxious they are about using computers. <a href="#dyc94">Dyck 
  and Smither, 1994</a> found this true for younger and older subjects (recruited 
  from senior citizens courses and continuing <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>courses). Therefore, given 
  similar <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>experience, age does not seem to make a difference in people's 
  comfort levels with computers. Medical doctors, who we <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>have similar educational 
  <span>backgrounds</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> showed no difference in usage of electronic resources in terms 
  of sex or age (<a href="#lae01">Laerum, 2001</a>). </p>

<h4> Gender</h4>

<p> Gender is another relevant factor in examining use of electronic databases. In a study of high <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>students, it was found that their <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>towards computers and their <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use tended to vary by gender. This difference, howeve,r tended to diminish with <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>experience. (<a href="#sac93">Sacks, 1993/94)</a>. Other studies have found similar results: Dyck and Smither, for example, found that &quot;...when the effects of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>experience were <span>controlled</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> there were no gender effects.&quot; (<a href="#dyc94">Dyck and Smither, 1994: 246</a>). In a study of 60 college <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> <a href="#koo86">Koohang</a> (1986) found that neither age nor gender was <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>correlated to <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>anxiety, <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>confidence or liking, but that <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>experience was.</p>

<p>While the gender gap relating to <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use seems to be shrinking, several studies have found that there is a gender gap when con0ering use of the Internet, and that gender is a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>predictor of Internet use and attitudes; males seem to enjoy browsing on the Internet for enjoyment while females tend to only use it for work-related <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#for96">Ford and Miller, 1996:188</a>). In a study of highly successful <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Ford, <em>et al.</em> found that &quot;...females tended to experience more <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>finding information on-line, to feel less competent and comfortable using the Internet, to use the Internet less <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>than males, and to make use of a less varied set of Internet <span>applications</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot; (<a href="#for01">Ford, <em>et al.</em>, 2001: 1061</a>). <a href="#maj99"> Majid</a> (1999) found a similar result in studying faculty members: while males tended to have better computing skills than females, age and year of obtaining highest educational qualifications were also important factors in <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>computer skills.</p>

 <h3>Faculty influence</h3>
 
<p> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>study of faculty's use of electronic resources found that it was &quot;influenced by such factors as computing skills of academics, their age and gender.&quot; (<a href="#maj99">Majid, 1999: 110</a>). They found an especially significant relationship between computing skills and use of electronic resources in the library, including the Online Public Access <span>Computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or OPAC, the library's online catalogue (<a href="#maj99">Majid, 1999</a>: 9).  Faculty with higher computing skills were not only more likely to use and be <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with their library's electronic resources, including the OPAC, but also tended to use the Internet more <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#maj99">Majid, 1999</a>).</p> 

<p>This can have implications for how much encouragement <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>will get from their professors when completing assignments. Anyone having worked at the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>desk can attest that professors will send <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to use those resources with which they themselves are <span>familiar</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> regardless of whether the library still has that particular resource, or whether it is still the most appropriate one.</p>

<h3>Frequency of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use</h3>
  
<p>Computer anxiety is another contributing reason that discourages users from <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>advantage of library resources and services (<a href="#bro98">Brosnan, 1998</a>). Because much of today's information technology makes use of computers, it is important to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the relationship between <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use by <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and their use of electronic resources in the library. For example, a study of faculty at Western Michigan University showed that frequent users of the library tended to make greater use of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and the library's databases than infrequent users, and also reported higher expertise in using these <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#mee97">Meer, 1997</a>). Moreover, the level of computing and Internet experience with which <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>enter higher <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>might influence whether or not they will use the library's electronic resources (<a href="#mcg01">McGuigan,  
2001</a>). </p>
  
<h3>Library use</h3>

<p>Students' library use is another variable influencing the use of electronic resources. It is <span>reasonable</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that the more an undergraduate uses the library, the more <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the student will be with its resources, including its electronic resources. However, if <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use the library primarily as a quiet and convenient place to study, they may not be aware of its resources at all, as compared to the student who never puts a foot in the library. Several studies have shown that undergraduates use the library mostly as a place to study and make photocopies, but do not make great use of some of the available library services, such as interlibrary loan and the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>desk (<a href="#whi01b">Whitmire, 2001b</a>).</p>

<p>A longitudinal study of undergraduates by Whitmire (<a href="#whi01a">2001a,</a><a href="#whi01b"> 2001b</a>) shows that library use by undergraduates changed according to their <span>status</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> In particular she found that library use increased from freshmen to junior years, especially in the use of computers for research, although this might also be because juniors have more assignments where they need to do research.</p>

  
<h3>Self-efficacy</h3>

<p>The <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of self-efficacy is another variable that appears to influence use of the library's electronic resources. Self-efficacy has been used in a variety of fields since its <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in 1977 by Alberto Bandura, </p>
  
<p>According to Bandura, self-efficacy is part of an individual's &quot;beliefs in <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>capability to organize and execute the courses of <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>required to  manage prospective situations.&quot; (<a href="#ban97">Bandura, 1997: 2</a>). Individuals get their self-efficacy <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in several ways. The first and most significant way is by interpreting what they did; self-efficacy is not a static concept, it is continually being actualized in an individual's mind, through what Bandura called &quot;mastery experiences&quot;: &quot;Outcomes interpreted as successful raise self-efficacy; those interpreted as failures lower it.&quot; ( <a href="#paj97">Pajares, 1997</a>)</p>
  
<p>Individuals also develop self-efficacy <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>through &quot;vicarious experiences&quot;, by observing how peers have dealt with certain experiences, and from there inferring how they would handle a similar experience. However, this is a less significant way of <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>self-efficacy. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>still weaker way self-efficacy <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>develop is through &quot;verbal persuasions&quot;, when someone gives oral encouragement or communicates their confidence that someone else will be able to succeed. Interestingly, &quot;it is usually easier to weaken self-efficacy <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>through negative appraisals than to strengthen such <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>through positive encouragement&quot; (<a href="#paj97">Pajares, 1997</a>). Individuals form their self-efficacy <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by incorporating and weighing these factors.</p>

<p>Bandura makes clear, however, that self-efficacy <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are <span>beliefs</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> they are not related to <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>skill level, but are relevant in determining how long an individual perseveres in a task, and whether the task will be engaged in at all. In academic settings, </p>

<blockquote>Students confident in their academic skills expect higher marks on exams and expect the <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of their work to reap benefits. The <span>opposite</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is also true of those who <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>such confidence. Students who <span>doubt</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>their academic ability envision low marks before they begin an exam. (<a href="#paj97">Pajares, 1997</a>). </blockquote>

<p>Self-efficacy <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>contribute to effective <span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>by increasing motivation, task <span>focus</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> and effort and decreasing anxiety and self-defeating negative thinking (<a href="#ban97">Bandura, 1997</a>). <a href="#sch94">Schunk </a> (1994) demonstrated that &quot;When self-efficacy is too low, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>will not be motivated to learn&quot; (<a href="#sch94">Schunk, 1994: 87</a>), therefore different <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>will need to be <span>devised</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to reach such <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
  
<p>Much research on self-efficacy has focused on the relationship between self-efficacy and academic achievement. <a href="#pin91">Pintrich and Garcia </a> (1991) showed that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with higher self-efficacy &quot;use more <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and metacognitive <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and persist longer than those who do not&quot; (<a href="#paj97">Pajares, 1997</a>). </p>

<p>Of interest to us in this study is research related to academic motivation and self-regulation, and <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use (<a href="#pin95">Pintrich and Schunk, 1995;</a><a href="#com95"> Compeau, 1995</a>). The studies focusing on <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>have explored the relationship of self-efficacy with the <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of college <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and career, and with <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> performances and <span>achievements</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#paj97">Pajares, 1997</a>). </p>

<p>It is also important to note that academic self-efficacy <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>vary according to subject matter, in that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>may have high self-efficacy in one subject but not in another: mathematics self-efficacy is independent of <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>self-efficacy, depending on their mastery and vicarious experiences in each subject.</p>

<blockquote>…researchers have reported that students’ self-efficacy <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are correlated with other motivation constructs and with students’ academic performances and achievement. Constructs in these studies have included attributions, goal <span>setting</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> modeling, problem <span>solving</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and domain-specific anxiety, reward contingencies, self-regulation, social comparisons, strategy training, other self-beliefs and expectancy constructs, and varied academic performances across domains. (<a href="#paj97">Pajares, 1997</a>)</blockquote>

<p>Because &quot;People are generally more interested in performing activities in which they have high self-efficacy&quot; (<a href="#ren00">Ren, 2000: 323</a>), we can imagine that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with high self-efficacy will be more likely to take advantage of what is around them. That is, if they are <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and feel comfortable with computers, they will use them, and if they feel that learning about a library's resources will enhance their academic <span>performance</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> they will learn about them. Research has demonstrated that college <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> &quot; <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use and their technology acceptance are positively related to <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>self-efficacy. <span>Computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>self-efficacy has a <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>effect on a <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>s <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the ease of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use, which, in turn, affects the frequency and time of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use.&quot; (<a href="#ren00">Ren, 2000: 324</a>). Studying self-efficacy in relation to learning Internet skills, <a href="#nah96">Nahl and Tenopir </a> (1996) also found that higher self-efficacy <span>translated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in higher <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>efficiency, success and satisfaction.  In a study of library instruction and self-efficacy,  <a href="#ren00">Ren </a> (2000) also showed a positive correlation between <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> self-efficacy and the frequency of use of the library electronic resources.</p>

<p>In studying working adults' information seeking behaviour, <a href="#bro01"> Brown, Challagalla, and Ganesan </a> (2001) found that &quot;employees with high self-efficacy effectively seek, integrate, and use information to increase role clarity and <span>performance</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> whereas employees with low self-efficacy do not.&quot; (<a href="#bro01">Brown, <em>et al.</em>, 2001: 1049</a>). It seems <span>reasonable</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that the same would true of <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> information-seeking behaviour. </p>

<p>Bandura also looked at how self-efficacy relates to <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use, linking <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use with educational achievement, especially since computers provide &quot;a ready means for self-directed learning. Disparities in <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>skills can create disparities in educational development&quot; (<a href="#ban97">Bandura, 1997: 434</a>). He goes on to note &quot;Belief in <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>efficacy to master computers predicts enrollment in <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>courses <span>independently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>about the instrumental benefits of knowing how to use them&quot; (<a href="#ban97">Bandura, 1997: 435</a>). We might infer therefore that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with a high self-efficacy regarding computers would also be more likely to explore new technologies, <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or databases. They would be more likely, for example, to explore a library's Website and find that the library has specialized resources, and they might even try some searches on those resources, without, or with less, prompting from professors and/or librarians and without <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>taking library workshops.</p>

<p>A &quot;problem&quot; is that the Internet is so easy to use. Indeed &quot;a  brief <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>is <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for hypertext users to be able to apply minimal <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>system <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to find information.&quot; (<a href="#laz00">Lazonder, <em>et al.</em>, 2000: 577</a>). However <a href="#hil97"> Hill and Hannafin </a> (1997) showed that <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on the Internet tended to be primitive if there was little Internet familiarity,  even if there was great subject expertise.</p>
  
<p>One reason users may choose to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>library resources might be that: </p>

<blockquote> The ways in which users choose and <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>between information services to meet their information needs are <span>expressions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of their views about the best information strategy given those information needs. Each user's strategy is <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>on the basis of such factors as his or her <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of the value of the products  delivered by each service, the likelihood of success in using each service, knowledge that the services exists, and the logical dependencies between one service and the other. (<a href="#hei00">Heine, 2000: 233</a>). </blockquote>

<p>Although there is a correlation between <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use and self-efficacy, and there are some gender differences in <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use, the study by Ford <em>et al.</em> found &quot;... no link between female gender and low self-efficacy&quot; (<a href="#for01">Ford, <em>et al.</em>, 2001: 1060</a>), that is. it is not the gender variable that determines the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of self-efficacy. </p>

<p>In this study it is hypothesized that:</p>

<ol>
<li><a name="hyp1"></a>Students who have more <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>experience will be more likely to use the library’s electronic resources and have higher self-efficacy.</li>
<li><a name="hyp2"></a>Students who use the library’s electronic resources from home have higher self-efficacy. </li>
<li><a name="hyp3"></a>Students who frequent the library more often are more likely to use the library’s electronic resources.</li>
<li><a name="hyp4"></a>Students who use the library’s electronic resources will be able to discriminate them from information from the Internet.</li>
<li><a name="hyp5"></a>Students who <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>interest in learning about the library’s electronic resources will have higher self-efficacy.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>We surveyed a class of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>&quot;Introduction to Psychology&quot;  at Baruch College, City University of New York. Our data were collected in the Fall semester of 2001, during the last class before examinations. This is a large lecture class with about 500 <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> and attracts mostly freshmen. Although the class did not have a library component, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>were encouraged to use technology <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the semester by participating in Blackboard, a distance-learning course management system.</p>

<p>A pilot <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>was conducted in the Spring semester of 2001. That <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>had a number of open-ended questions, that were used to determine the close questions we asked in the Fall <span>survey</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Although helpful in some areas (for example, to determine what <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>came to the library for), some of the open-ended questions had a very low answering rate and therefore were not helpful in focusing our final <span>survey</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>s questions (in particular, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>did not answer open-ended questions relating to which electronic resources they used.)</p>
  
<p>Our Fall 2001 <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>contained two distinctive parts: a self-efficacy standard measuring <span>instrument</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and a library component. The <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>has been included in <a href="#app"> <span>Appendix</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>A</a>. </p>

<p>The self-efficacy <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>made use of a Likert scale. Seventeen <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>were presented to the <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> and they could <span>agree</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>or disagree with them on a five point scale, from 1=Strongly Disagree to 5=Strongly Agree. Thus. a total <span>numerical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>value can be calculated from all the responses. </p>
  
<p>The library section <span>consisted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of 35 questions. Questions one through eight were concerned with gathering demographic data. Questions nine to 16 focused on whether or not the student used the Internet and what for. Questions 17 to 31 dealt with how the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>used the library and its electronic resources. Questions 31 to 35 focused on the how <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>gather necessary information for their research. Most questions were closed-ended, although some were open-ended. </p>
  
<p>Survey responses were coded and input into the SPSS <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>package for analysis and the hypotheses presented above were tested using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVA is used to uncover the effects of independent variables on an interval dependent variable. This procedure employs the statistic (F) to <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>significance of the differences among the obtained means of two or more random <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>from a given population. The statistic (F) is a ratio, which, if sufficiently <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>than 1, indicates that the <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>differences among the obtained means are statistically significant. It is important to note here, however, that the <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>were not random, which reduces the generalization of our results.</p>

<h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
	
<h3>Demographics</h3>

<p>Data from 340 usable surveys showed that the class was composed of 90% freshmen, 54% female <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> 77% who were between the ages of 17 and 21, and 47% were working part-time.</p> 

<p>This Baruch College class, characteristically, was composed of a rich diversity of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in that 34% of the respondents were White, 18% Asian, 13% Hispanic, and 10% African-American. </p>
  
<p>This freshman class presents a similar make-up as the Baruch undergraduate population as a whole for the Fall 2001 semester concerning gender, with a preponderance of female <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> Out of an enrollment of 12,969 undergraduates, 42.9% were males and 57.1% were females. Baruch's undergraduate population was also very diverse, although the proportions were slightly different: 28.5% White Non-Hispanic, 25.1% were Asian or Pacific-Islander, 18.7% were Black Non-Hispanic, 18.5% Hispanic and 0.1% American Indian or Alaskan Native (<a href="#nat01"> National Center for Education Statistics, 2001</a>).</p>

<h3>Computer and Internet use</h3>

<p>Computers are definitively present in <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> lives in that 94% reported having access to a personal <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>at home, with 93% saying they own one. For this population of incoming <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>there is no digital divide. Perhaps because so many <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>have access to a <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>at home, they do not seem fully aware of the computing resources available to them: only 34% said they had access to computers at <span>school</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> although there are student <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>laboratories on campus. </p>
  
<p>Our incoming <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are also very <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with the Internet: 73% say they access the Internet daily, and an additional 25% at least once a week. In other words, over 97% of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>access the Internet weekly or more often. When surfing, 44% look for educational information, 42% for entertainment information, 30% for news, 25% check for sports information, 9% for health information, and 70% report using e-mail often. </p>
  
<p>While it is rewarding to see that so many <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use the Internet for educational <span>purposes</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> it is important to clearly understand what they deem as educational. Is it Blackboard usage, researching <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>papers, or word processing?</p>
  
<p>It is also interesting to note that so few <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for health information on the Internet, when other research has shown that a great number of people use the Internet to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for health information (<a href="#lew01">Lewis and Behana, 2001</a>). Perhaps searching for health information online might be linked to age of the researcher. </p>

<h3>Library use.</h3>

<p>Data revealed that 67% visit the library weekly, and only 1% has never been to the library [Table 1]. Asked what they did at the library, 80% reported studying, 38% to do research, 33% to sleep, 30% to socialize, 24% to use the library's electronic resources, 22% to check books out and 21% to e-mail or chat [Table 2]. Even though some of these areas overlap (research and use of electronic resources, for example), it is clear that these <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are mostly using the library as a place,  not to make use of the library's resources or services.</p> 

 
<div align="center"><img src="p150fig1.gif" width="507" height="284" border="0" alt=""></div>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="p150fig2.gif" width="495" height="400" border="0" alt=""></div>
<br>

<p>It is interesting to note that although only 24% responded that they use the library's electronic resources when at the library, 81% responded that they have used those resources, and 30% said they use them at least weekly. </p>

<h3>Use of electronic resources</h3>

<p>We then asked <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>which electronic resources they were <span>familiar</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with. During the earlier pilot <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span><span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>did not reply to open questions on the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and, therefore, the resources available at the Baruch College Newman library were listed, including some more specialized databases we doubted freshmen would have used. The results are in the <span>table</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>below.</p>

</table>

<p>Some of these numbers were thought-provoking. We were surprised to see how many <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>claimed to have used <em>Lexis/Nexis</em>, since it contains newspaper articles and law information, although they might have used to it find current information on <span>controversial</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>topics, which are common paper or speech topics. On the other hand, perhaps Lexis/Nexis has great name recognition, having been around for a while.</p>

<p>We were glad to see that 36% of the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>surveyed had used or at least recognized <em>DPAC</em>, our online catalogue; since only 21% used the library to check books out. It is possible that DPAC use comes from checking course reserves.</p>

<p>We were not very surprised to see that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>made use of <em>Academic Search Premier</em> and <em>Ebsco Host</em> since they are good general databases, with a number of full-text sources. Although <em>Academic Search Premier</em> is one of the databases included in <em>Ebsco Host</em>, we decided to give <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>both choices since we provide <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>access to them from the library's electronic resources Web page.</p>
  
<p>While 88% knew they could access the library's electronic resources from home, 50% reported using them from home. This demonstrates that our freshmen are quite sophisticated in an online <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> and that the library has been doing a good job in terms of letting <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>know they can access resources from home. However, the fact that freshmen <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are using <em>DPER</em> (a magazine and journal index) is not a reassuring sign. Indeed <em>DPER</em> has not been <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in the library since December 1999 (nor has it been updated since then) and was replaced by a Web-based <em>First Search</em> Wilson index. It is possible therefore that professors are directing their <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to use <em>DPER</em>.</p>
  
<p>This would be consistent with the fact that 28% report learning about electronic resources from their professors, compared to 30% who learn from library workshops. Since our workshop count is not that high, and <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>more senior <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> it is possible that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are including course-related <span>lectures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>given by the library faculty, in particular once consisting of two sessions, given to freshmen as part of a new initiative on information literacy.</p>
  
<p>Sixty-one percent of the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>reported that using the library's electronic resources is somewhat easy or very easy. However 50% of them realize there is a difference between the library's electronic resources and Internet resources. This might explain why 77% start their research through the Internet, not the library's resources (electronic or otherwise). Sixty-seven percent also report that they find most information for their papers through the Internet, while only 27% report using the library's electronic resources and 20% report using non-electronic resources. </p>

<p>We then tested our hypotheses using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). While age or gender did not have any effect on <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> use of the library's electronic resources, self-efficacy did. By dividing the self-efficacy scores into high self-efficacy (top 20 percentile) and low self-efficacy (bottom 20 percentile), we were able to create two groups and compare them with library use. </p>

<p>We found that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>who use the library more <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(monthly, weekly, or daily) were more likely to report using the library's electronic resources than those who rarely used the library (never, once/twice), <b>F</b>(1, 336) = 16.416, p&lt;.01. This is a very interesting fact since most <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>do not spend their time using the library's resources, but using the library as a place to study, sleep, or socialize. It seems that being in the library <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>influences <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> awareness of the resources available to them, even if they do not make use of them. </p>
  
<p>This might also be related to the fact that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>who visit the library more <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>(monthly, weekly, or daily) had higher self-efficacy scores than those who reported using the library less often (never, once/twice), <b>F</b>(1, 112) = 3.833, p&lt;.05. That <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with higher self-efficacy tend to use the library more often correlates with other research on self-efficacy, in that self-efficacious <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>tend to be more active academically and use the resources available to them. This also explains why <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>who use the library more often use the library's electronic resources more <span>frequently</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>
  
<p>Students who found the library's electronic resources easy to use had higher self-efficacy scores as compared to those who found the electronic resources difficult to use, <b>F</b>(1, 18) = 7.004, p&lt;.05. This result correlates with other self-efficacy research in that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with higher self-efficacy tend to believe in their <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and will work harder to learn what they don't know. This is true even if they do not have the skills to use the library's electronic resources for they will tend to work at developing them. </p>
  
<p>Finally, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>who report being highly motivated to learn about the library's electronic resources have higher self-efficacy scores when compared to those who are unmotivated to learn, <b>F</b>(1, 58) = 4.814, p&lt;.05. This result also relates to other research on self-efficacy since <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>with higher self-efficacy tend to believe in their <span>abilities</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>and want to expand them, so they would want to learn about resources they think would be helpful to their academic careers.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this study we found significant support for <a href="#hyp3">hypothesis 3</a>: that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>who frequent the library more often are more likely to use the library's electronic resources; and for <a href="#hyp5">hypothesis 5</a>: that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>who <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>an interest in learning about the library's electronic resources will be more likely to exhibit higher self-efficacy. We also have evidence (non-significant) demonstrating that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>who have more <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>experience will be more likely to use the library's electronic resources and have higher self-efficacy (<a href="#hyp1">hypothesis 1</a>), that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>who use the library's electronic resources from home have higher self-efficacy (<a href="#hyp2">hypothesis 2</a>), and that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>who use the library's electronic resources will be able to discriminate them from information from the Internet (<a href="#hyp4">hypothesis 4</a>).</p>
 
<p>In this paper we have tried to determine some <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>that would lead them to use the library's electronic resources. Through a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>administered to a class of freshmen we found that while age and gender were not related to use of electronic resources, self-efficacy was. Self-efficacy, the belief in <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>capacity to act in order to achieve <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>goals, was related in our research to a higher use of both the library and of electronic resources. </p>

<p>Although we are not be able to generalize from our results to the entire freshman population, since our <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>was not random, our results will be helpful in designing new initiatives that could enhance freshmen's use of the library's resources. Knowing that most of our <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>are basically <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>literate and somewhat competent in using the Web, we can create programmes that will build on those  skills.</p>
  
<p>This paper also points to several areas that need further research:</p>

<ol>
<li>Getting more <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>information on what, <span>exactly</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> freshmen are accessing when they <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of accessing the Internet for educational <span>purposes</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> </li>

<li>Examining what, specifically, freshmen mean when they <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of doing research in the library.</li>

<li>Ascertaining more information on which databases <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>use to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>for which <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of information.</li>

<li>Determining why so many freshmen are using <em>Lexis/Nexis</em>. </li>
</ol>

<p>An additional <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of inquiry would be to understand how <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>who use the library as a place to study develop more awareness of the library's resources. If a library <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>how <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>gained that awareness (through interacting with librarians at the <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>desk, or through following signs, or by observing other <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span> for example), the library could make further efforts to reach <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>in an efficient way. Also, if the library knew how <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>absorb this kind of information, it could be the basis for developing sound pedagogical methods to transmit information to our <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span></p>
  
<p>Finally, research could also explore, in more depth, what makes <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>decide to use the Internet as <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to the library's electronic resources, and what <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>of incentives would encourage <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:102px 34px 102px 34px;position:relative;">.</span>to use more of the library's resources.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2> 
 
<p>The use of information is a phenomenon which appears everywhere in the contexts 
  of everyday life - or, in fact, of all life (<a href="#sav09a">Savolainen 2009a</a>). 
  According to Cole (<a href="#col08">2008</a>), the broadest possible 
  matter for which we use information concerns the survival of our species. The 
  use of information, knowledge and research is also more widely considered as 
  a success criterion (<a href="#dun86">Dunn 1986</a>). Both information and knowledge 
  are representations of reality, but information is located outside one's 
  mind (e.g.,  text in a book), and knowledge is located inside one's mind 
  (e.g.,  a memory of the aforementioned text). In other words, knowledge is what 
  a person knows, whereas information can be either raw material for knowledge, 
  or externalized knowledge. (<a href="#kar96">Kari 1996</a>.) Against this background, 
  it is paradoxical that even though information use can be considered as the 
  most essential research area in studying information seeking (<a href="#tuo96">Tuominen 
  1996</a>), it seems to have become nearly stagnant. Indeed, Savolainen 
  (<a href="#sav09a">2009a</a>) states, justifiedly, that information scientists 
  have paid inadequate attention to the use of information. Because of this, theoretical 
  development in the research area has been very slow. </p>
  
<p>It is seemingly difficult to <em>capture</em> information use, as the 
  concept is often vaguely defined even in research studies, or it is not defined 
  at all (<a href="#lar80">Larsen 1980</a>, <a href="#sav09b">Savolainen 2009b</a>) 
  - like for example in the study of Harris <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#har06">2006</a>). 
  It is no wonder, then, that in the literature, much confusion has appeared about 
  the exact meaning of using information (<a href="#bou89">Bouazza 1989</a>, <a href="#dun86">Dunn 
  1986</a>). How should we understand this description, for example: '<em>information 
  use is that seeking behavior that leads to the use of information in order to 
  meet an individual's needs</em>' (<a href="#bou89">Bouazza 1989</a>: 146). 
  In it, the use of information is not only two separate stages of the same process, 
  but the latter one is not even defined. In cases like this, readers easily fall 
  by the wayside', or they get the impression that the writer
  does not know what s/he is talking about. </p>
  
<p> Dunn (<a href="#dun86">1986</a>) and  Larsen (<a href="#lar80">1980</a>) 
  imply that empirical attempts to measure the ambiguous and poorly understood 
  phenomenon exactly have led to incomparable and conflicting research results. 
  Thus, the research area has lacked unity (<a href="#hol79">Holzner and Fisher 
  1979</a>). There is no single <em>right</em> definition for the use of 
  information, but it can be understood in many different ways (<a href="#kir02">Kirk 
  2002</a>, <a href="#sav09c">Savolainen 2009c</a>). Earlier, such ideas have 
  been treated of by at least  Kari (<a href="#kar07">2007</a>),  Kirk 
  (<a href="#kir02">2002</a>),  Machlup (<a href="#mac80">1980</a>),  
  Maybee (<a href="#may06">2006</a>, <a href="#may07">2007</a>),  Meyer 
  (<a href="#mey03">2003</a>),  Savolainen (<a href="#sav00">2000</a>, <a href="#sav09a">2009a</a>), 
  and  Ward (<a href="#war83">1983</a>). In all of these sources, the examination 
  has remained more or less limited, however, probably due to a narrow focus or 
  the material used. </p>
  
<p>In the case of information use, terminological problems are also big, because 
  kindred expressions such as <em>knowledge use, information 
  use, knowledge utilization, information utilization</em>, 
  and <em>information processing</em> are synonymously, 
  and their meaning is often not clarified (e.g.,  <a href="#sav09a">Savolainen 
  2009a</a>: Introduction, <a href="#tod97">Todd 1997</a>: 354). The widely varying 
  language makes it difficult or impossible to compare the essential differences 
  in the concepts, estimates Dunn (<a href="#dun83">1983</a>). However, we should 
  not stay on the level of mere words in our examination, but should go beyond 
  them and concentrate on the concept, in other words on what those words refer 
  to. We must be careful in each case when choosing and defining the term. The 
  article uses <em>information use</em> as a general term, but the next section 
  will introduce more exact terms which reflect the different understandings of 
  information use. Without this kind of a holistic language, the confusions and 
  misunderstandings which afflict the study of information use would only continue 
  (<a href="#lar80">Larsen 1980</a>). </p>
  
<p>Therefore, the task of this paper is to conceptualize the use of information: 
  what does it really mean? The objective is to go through all the different notions 
  of information use, and thereby lay bare their diversity. The analysis is mainly 
  based on research literature in the field of information studies. The <em>(<a href="http://www.csa.com/factsheets/lisa-set-c.php">Library 
  and Information Science Abstracts</a></em> database) 
  was searched for publications by using certain keywords (<em>information 
  use</em> and <em>knowledge use</em>') and quality (peer-reviewed articles 
  and books from scientific publishers) as selection criteria. Someone might argue 
  that the literature search was too narrow: what about other fields like reading 
  research? While it is true that the search focused on the designated core area 
  (as outlined above), following up references in the literature led to the discovery 
  of additional sources in neighbouring areas.  Cook and Brown 
  (<a href="#coo99">1999</a>), for example, discuss information use in terms of 
  epistemic work (see below). Such instances enrich our understanding of information 
  use. The conceptions of information use covered in this article are categories 
  which were inductively formed based on the written material. </p>

<h2>Information use can be conceptualized ...</h2>

<p>By appealing to holism,  Hughes (<a href="#hug06">2006</a>) proposes 
  that as a multifaceted experience, the use of information covers the user's 
  behaviour, connecting (to the information source), searching for information, 
  information skills, utilizing information, information literacy, information 
  needs, context, reactions and effects, as well as results (of learning). Hughes 
  does not justify in more detail why the concept should be defined so broadly. 
  Of course, the use of information is an informational phenomenon, but so are 
  many others, too. Let us embark on studying what more limited and thus more 
  realistic meanings have been ascribed to information use, and what features 
  each class of information use exhibits (<a href="#lar80">Larsen 1980</a>).</p>

<h3>... as information practices</h3>

<p>In this general class, the use of information can be characterized as intellectual 
  activity which is manifested through various thoughts and deeds (<a href="#lim98">Limberg 
  1998</a>). Correspondingly, by following ideas proposed by Cook and Brown, information 
  use may be understood as epistemic (knowledge) work which is done as a natural 
  part of action or practice, for example when estimating the relevance of work-related 
  information that has been retrieved from the Web (<a href="#sav09a">Savolainen 
  2009a</a>). </p>
  
<p>In Maybee's interview study, four different ways to understand the use 
  of information were found. From one of them, one can get a fairly good, general 
  idea of what kinds of function can belong to information use. In it, the participants 
  experienced the use of information as building a knowledge base which can then 
  be used for different purposes. The information uses contained decision-making 
  and problem-solving, forming a personal point of view, sharing the information 
  to others, and creating new knowledge. The properties described in the knowlegde 
  base category were directed at the need to understand the viewpoint of the information 
  provider. However, the primary focus of the consciousness structure was on how 
  the information is utilized, and building one's knowledge base was secondary. 
  (<a href="#may07">Maybee 2007</a>.) Many others have also listed <em>different 
  forms</em> of information practice which the use of information is considered 
  to mean: </p>
  
<ul>
  <li>how people approach sources of information and adopt information available 
in them (<a href="#sav09a">Savolainen 2009a</a>); </li>
  <li>reading, thinking about the acquired information, comparing different sources; 
analysing and evaluating information; doing syntheses and creating meaning 
from information (<a href="#lim98">Limberg 1998</a>); </li>
  <li>receiving and internalizing information (<a href="#mac80">Machlup 1980</a>);</li>
  <li>sending and receiving information (<a href="#mac80">Machlup 1980</a>); </li>
  <li>decoding and coding stimuli in a symbolic system (<a href="#spi09">Spink 
<em>et al.</em> 2009</a>); </li>
  <li>interpreting the value of information sources more generally, and directing 
action (<a href="#sav08">Savolainen 2008</a>); </li>
  <li>the resolution of a process of becoming informed (to get to know a matter), 
or applying information (<a href="#gia98">Giannini 1998</a>) ;</li>
  <li>evaluating, adopting and applying new information (<a href="#cho06">Choo 
2006</a>); </li>
  <li>the reception and interpretation of information, and on the other hand, 
the functional utilization of the information (<a href="#tuo96">Tuominen 1996</a>); 
  </li>
  <li>applying specific social scientific research programs, making decisions 
to influence matters, consuming and actively adopting information (<a href="#tod99">Todd 
1999</a>) </li>
  <li>information search and retrieval, the applications of information to different 
purposes, as well as the creation and storage of information (<a href="#huv08">Huvila 
2008</a>); </li>
  <li>applying information in some specific action or in satisfying a more general 
need, as well as sharing the information with other interested individuals, 
or some activity of <em>information management</em> (<a href="#erd97">Erdelez 
1997</a>: 416). </li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, the use of information can also be understood as an informational 
  <em>process </em>(cf. <a href="#may06">Maybee 2006</a>), the stages of which 
  the various informational operations are. For example in Kirk's interview 
  study, one notion of information use was the packaging of information, which 
  was experienced as three different stages. These were named as searching, manipulating 
  and publishing information. The beginning of the information packaging process 
  was marked by collecting information for a certain purpose, and the end was 
  marked by presenting the packaged information to its intended audience or recipient. 
  (<a href="#kir02">Kirk 2002</a>.) Similarly,  Rich (<a href="#ric97">1997</a>) 
  proposes that the process of information use is composed of the following events: 
  1) fetching information, 2) processing information, and 3) applying information. 
</p>

<p>Also in Maybee's study, some participants solely experienced information 
  use as beginning and performing a process. The use of information contained 
  steps or stages which typically began with noticing an information need. As 
  a consequence, a search was made, and information was accumulated. This could 
  be a repeated process. Eventually, the information was applied to satisfy demands 
  and to resolve the need for information. The main attention of the interviewees' 
  consciousness structure focused on the processes by which information was looked 
  for. Even though information use was a part of the process described by the 
  participants, the information had to be obtained before it could be used. (<a href="#may07">Maybee 
  2007</a>.) </p>
  
<p>On the basis of the literature, the use of information would seem to be a really 
  multiform phenomenon: almost any kind of human interaction with information 
  will do as information use. However, Choo (<a href="#cho06">2006</a>) 
  specifies that the use of information is an essential <em>part</em> of evaluating, 
  adopting and applying new information. So, information practice is not necessarily 
  the same thing as information use, after all, for it can also be composed of 
  other things than just information use. In the following subsections, we will 
  take a closer look at what kinds of informational activity information use can 
  be understood as.</p>

<h3>... as information search</h3>

<p>When the use of information is considered as searching information, it covers 
  the same processes as traditionally the terms <em>information seeking</em>
  and <em>information retrieval</em>. In one model, information use is positioned 
  as a subconcept of information search (<a href="#spi06">Spink and Cole 2006</a>); 
  different sources are naturally searched for information with the help of different 
  tools. The <em>instrument </em>point of view is analysed at least in Maybee's 
  study, in which one of the discourses was to experience the use of information 
  as understanding technology and technological tools. It was seen that information 
  sources are approached through technological tools. In this way to experience 
  information use, an important component was to be able to use the technology 
  well. In this category, the participant concentrated on finding information 
  sources. The structure of consciousness reflected focusing on technology, showing 
  the subsidiary nature of information sources. (<a href="#may07">Maybee 2007</a>.) 
</p>

<p>However, it is more ordinary that the use of information is connected to looking 
  for information <em>sources</em>.  Wilson (<a href="#wil82">1982</a>) talks 
  about <em>use</em> in the sense of acquiring a document, and in information 
  studies, this is probably one of the most popular; even though, on the other 
  hand, most implicit, ways of understanding information use. (However, this is just a minor point of Wilson's. He  deals with the <em>usefulness</em> of a current awareness service and how social workers and their managers used  the information they received through the associated photocopy service. Some of those uses relate to what I below term 'knowledge construction' (e.g., confirmation of what one already believed), and some to 'information production' (e.g., writing a report).</p> 

<p>Likewise, when 
  patrons encounter information packages in the library, this is often called 
<em>use</em> (<a href="#for77">Ford 1977</a>). According to Rich (<a href="#ric83">1983</a>), 
  in turn, <em>use</em> is loosely defined as the consideration of all the 
  available information sources when weighing alternative ways of action. On the 
  other hand, there is a tendency to use the expression <em>information use</em> 
  as a comprehensive term which refers to the ways in which people choose and 
  approach information sources (<a href="#sav09b">Savolainen 2009b</a>). </p>
  
<p>In Maybee's study, the participants who experienced the source conception 
  of information use concentrated on information about information sources and 
  on understanding their properties. One aspect of this was to determine the reliability 
  of the information, based on the features of the source. The participants who 
  perceived the use of information in this way focused on finding information 
  from the sources. The structure of their consciousness reflected concentrating 
  on the sources, showing the secondary nature of information use, which takes 
  place after locating the information. (<a href="#may06">Maybee 2006</a>, <a href="#may07">Maybee 
  2007</a>.) It could be added here that the use of information typically includes 
  selecting information (<a href="#cho06">Choo 2006</a>), too - in other words, 
  its mere finding is not enough.</p>

<h3>... as information processing</h3>

<p>Searching and finding information are usually followed by processing it. This 
  typically belongs to the use of information (<a href="#cho06">Choo 2006</a>), too. In a literature review 
  by Meyer (<a href="#mey03">2003</a>), for example, one of the ways in which 
  the people of rural communities used information was to process information 
  when collecting, looking for, receiving and communicating it. The processing 
  of information comprises how information is understood, analysed and modified 
  (<a href="#lim98">Limberg 1998</a>). Havelock (<a href="#hav75">1975</a>: 88) 
  also uses the words <em>received</em> and <em>consumed</em>, but here 
  they belong to the same theme as Limberg's <em>understanding</em>. 
  A scientific sample of <em>modifying </em>as information use was not found, 
  and only one sample of <em>analysing </em>was found: use is more or less reflexively 
  weighing the relevance of materials, and the quick bypassing of unessential 
  portions thereof (<a href="#sav98">Savolainen 1998</a>). So in this case, the 
  analysis meant evaluating information. </p>
  
<p>A more general concept than <em>understanding</em> would perhaps be <em>incorporating</em>. 
   Spink and  Cole (<a href="#spi06">2006</a>) write that the problem-solving 
  definition of information use signifies the incorporation of the information 
  that has been found in the users' existing knowledge base by thinking, 
  by making notes, by somehow cognitively processing, or by adopting the information. 
  The making of notes distinctly refers to the inclusion of information in the 
  person's information base (one's collection of information), whereas the 
  thinking, cognitive processing and adopting refer to understanding or internalizing 
  information - in other words, to changing information into knowledge. Judging 
  by the literature, internalization seems to be the most central process of information 
  processing in information use.</p>
  
<p>Internalizing begins when the information has possibly been assessed on the 
  face of it, and it is taken under closer scrutiny (<a href="#sav98">Savolainen 
  1998</a>). Using is said to take place when the problem solver <em>swallows</em> 
  the contents of the information package (<a href="#for77">Ford 1977</a>). The 
  use of information comprises cognitions and behaviors in relation to adopting 
  information; they lead to cognitive effects as a prelude to resolving an informational 
  problem or need (<a href="#tod97">Todd 1997</a>). According to Savolainen, information 
  use is usually conceived as the last stage of the process of being informed. 
  Seen in this way, information use takes place when the information which was 
  searched for and found in some source is internalized - by reading an article, 
  for example. (<a href="#sav00">Savolainen 2000</a>: 35.) Machlup (<a href="#mac80">1980</a>) 
  claims that the recipient only uses information by listening or reading, but 
  in my opinion, at least watching and feeling (especially in the case of the 
  blind) could be added to the list. However, we may more generally state that 
  information use is the reception and understanding of information (<a href="#mac79">Machlup 
  1979</a>, <a href="#mac80">Machlup 1980</a>). </p>
  
<p>Early research identified use with the complete adoption of information in 
  its original form, reveals Larsen (<a href="#lar80">1980</a>, <a href="#lar83">1983</a>). 
  Nowadays, we know that only a part of information is often used, and it is not 
  internalized directly (cf. the mechanistic metaphor of information transfer) 
  but through interpretation (<a href="#tod97">Todd 1997</a>). Sometimes, the 
  use of information may indeed be referred to as how people interpret sense data 
  or the informational features of things (<a href="#sav09a">Savolainen 2009a</a>, 
  <a href="#sav09c">Savolainen 2009c</a>).  Tuominen clarifies, suggesting that, in constructivist 
  studies, the part of interpreting information is emphasized instead of the reception 
  of fixed information packages. Information is not so much received, but the 
  meaning of a certain document or message is only constructed in connection with 
  the interpretation process(es). (<a href="#tuo96">Tuominen 1996</a>.)  Interpreting 
  can be characterized so that in it, individuals relate information to their 
  own ideas, and thus personal understandings of the matter in question are created 
  (<a href="#sav98">Savolainen 1998</a>).</p>
  
<h3>... as knowledge construction</h3>

<p>In all probability, the processing of information usually leads (through understanding 
  it) to the construction of knowledge. Tuominen and Savolainen (<a href="#tuo97">1997</a>) 
  regard this as the first stage of using information. In the cognitive-constructivist 
  approach, the use of information is understood as a process in which constructs 
  are shaped or designed to function as a basis for thinking (<a href="#sav09a">Savolainen 
  2009a</a>). Researchers have written about these constructions with more concrete 
  terms. Information use can, for example, be conceptualized as one of the ways 
  in which <em>meanings </em>are made and unmade (<a href="#sav06">Savolainen 
  2006</a>). One metaphor asks us to imagine that the use of information is similar 
  to the drawing and constant editing of mental <em>images </em>or <em>maps </em>(<a href="#dun86">Dunn 
  1986</a>). </p>
  
<p>In one of the categories discovered by Kirk, on the other hand, information 
  use was experienced as a process of developing new <em>knowledge</em> and <em>conceptions</em>. 
  The human being develops these <em>understandings</em> from information 
  and from analysing and meditating on it. The evidence suggested that there are 
  cognitive and affective sides in this sort of information use. When physical, 
  perceptible activity was mentioned, it was related to withdrawing from a situation, 
  so that space and time could be obtained for the appearance of new understandings 
  and ideas. (<a href="#kir02">Kirk 2002</a>.) Also other researchers have paid 
  particular attention to understanding. In a proposal by Savolainen (<a href="#sav06">2006</a>), 
  the use of information may signify that all kinds of cognitive and affective 
  elements which can help in the creation of a new understanding are utilized. 
  In an interview study by Ross (<a href="#ros00">2000</a>), in turn, 
  readers used texts in order to make sense of life in very different situations.</p>

<p>Most of all, however, construing seems to be connected to knowledge. The use 
  of information can be defined as the interpretation and coding of environmental 
  stimuli, whereby the human organism creates new and adapted knowledge structures 
  (<a href="#col08">Cole 2008</a>). Other researchers only mention one knowledge 
  totality in the human mind. For example, in the <em>fundamental equation</em> 
  of  Brookes, information use is seen as the connecting of <em>small 
  parts</em>' or information to one's existing knowledge structure (<a href="#sav00">Savolainen 
  2000</a>). In Maybee's study, some participants considered the use of 
  information as building one's personal knowlegde base for different purposes 
  (<a href="#may06">Maybee 2006</a>). According to Wilson, in turn, <em>information 
  use behaviour</em> consists of physical and mental actions when information 
  that has been found is connected to the person's existing knowlegde base. It 
  may thus include physical acts such as marking text passages to help notice 
  their importance or significance, as well as mental acts to which belongs, for 
  example, comparing new information with one's existing knowledge. (<a href="#wil00">Wilson 
  2000</a>: 50.) </p>
  
<p>The construction of knowledge has also been examined in relation to the need 
  for information. In that case, the use of information is characterized by resolving 
  an unstable state of knowledge, such as a question (<a href="#gia98">Giannini 
  1998</a>). Correspondingly, Savolainen interprets  Dervin's Sense-Making 
  theory as approaching information use metaphorically in terms of <em>gap-bridging</em>: 
  the actor designs and creates a <em>bridge</em> over a knowledge <em>gap</em> 
  by pulling together cognitive and affective elements. By <em>walking</em> 
  along the bridge, the individual reaches the other edge of the gap; the project 
  is over and a new meaning has been created. (<a href="#sav00">Savolainen 2000</a>.) 
  In this way, constructing knowledge responds to the information need.</p>

<h3>... as information production</h3>

<p>As the counterbalance of internalizing, it is also naturally possible to externalize 
  human knowledge. When producing information, the actor creates an expression 
  of knowledge which others can also observe - at least in principle. At its simplest, 
  it is a question of <em>sharing information</em>, in which case information 
  is mainly forwarded. This is examplified by the information flow conception 
  which surfaced in Kirk's study: Information use was experienced as making 
  it possible for information to flow. The information flow concentrated on the 
  sharing of information with people. It differed from the information packaging 
  conception in that sending or exchanging information was dependent on interaction 
  with others, and it was not as clearly defined as the three stages of packaging 
  information. The information flow conception most distinctly resonates with 
  the last stage of packaging information, in other words with publishing. (<a href="#kir02">Kirk 
  2002</a>.) In another empiric case, the use of information was determined to 
  be the way in which development organizations apply information in order to 
  present the contents of development projects to their target groups in the rural 
  communities of a developing country (<a href="#mey03">Meyer 2003</a>). This 
  can be considered as information sharing, even though it was probably preceded 
  by the editing of the information to suit the recipients. </p>
  
<p>Information is also used by justifying a matter to others with it. Thus people 
  appeal to an external authority, so that their message would get more credibility. 
  This can be called <em>discursive use</em>. When examining information use as 
  discursive action, it is important to keep in mind that an attempt is made to 
  render a version of the state of affairs or of events authentic, particularly 
  in situations in which this version has somehow become controversial (<a href="#tuo97">Tuominen 
  and Savolainen 1997</a>). </p>
  
<p>Furthermore, it is possible to produce information by <em>combining information</em>. 
  According to Ward (<a href="#war83">1983</a>), one kind of information use takes 
  place in the process of developing a synthesis product - in other words, when 
  written and spoken forms of information are amalgamated. Also other kinds of 
  information or knowledge can be combined. So for example, this paper is a result 
  of information/knowledge use, because I (the writer) combined my own knowledge 
  and information received from others in order to produce it.</p>
 
<h3>... as applying information</h3>

<p>When the use of information is conceptualized as applying information, information 
  is not seen as intrinsically valuable, but above all as a tool (<a href="#kar09">Kari 
  2009</a>): the role of information is to function as a resource in some process. 
  A slight taster of this was already obtained with discursive use (in previous 
  subsection). The application of information has been talked about with different 
  expressions. Some people use the term <em>applying</em> (see section <em>... 
  as information practices</em>), whereas others favour the term <em>utilizing</em>. 
  An example of the latter  can be found in  Niemel&auml;'s (<a href="#nie06">2006</a>) 
  doctoral thesis in which information use is defined as the utilization of the 
  information contents of different channels. In Dervin's Sense-Making theory, 
  the word <em>uses</em>' in turn signifies ways in which cognitive <em>bridges</em>, 
  or answers to questions, are <em>put to work</em> (<a href="#sav92">Savolainen 
  1992</a>). Also <em>implementation</em> has been considered as information use 
  (<a href="#lar80">Larsen 1980</a>). </p>
  
<p>Generally speaking, information - particularly internalized information, or 
  knowledge - is thought of as something which is used or utilized in certain 
  <em>action </em>(e.g.,  <a href="#coo99">Cook and Brown 1999</a>, <a href="#lar80">Larsen 
  1980</a>, <a href="#sav09a">Savolainen 2009a</a>, <a href="#tuo97">Tuominen 
  and Savolainen 1997</a>). The use of information is thus constructive and 
  functional, because it is oriented to action (<a href="#tuo97">ibid.</a>).  
  Orlikowski's findings suggest that information use is always anchored 
  to concrete repertoires of activity which form practices (<a href="#sav09a">Savolainen 
  2009a</a>). She holds that knowledge is something which is carried out, every 
  day and over time, in people's practices. This kind of <em>knowing-in-practice</em> 
  always takes place at a certain moment: in other words, it is not an abstract 
  process. (<a href="#orl02">Orlikowski 2002</a>: 250, 252.) </p>
  
<p>In his flow model,  Al-Fedaghi (<a href="#alf08">2008</a>) proposes that 
  the use of information is a gateway from the informational sphere to the non-informational 
  sphere. However, the matter is not this simple, because applying information 
  can be informational instead of or in addition to practical (e.g.,  <a href="#kar08">Kari 
  2008</a>). The following list illustrates the issue: </p>
  
<ul>
  <li>Knowledge is used when it is executed as a part of a social programme (<a href="#lar80">Larsen 1980</a>). </li>
  <li>In an adaptation process, written or spoken information is used to direct practice or research (<a href="#war83">Ward 1983</a>).</li>
  <li>An act or commitment based on information is information use (<a href="#rie98">Rieh and Belkin 1998</a>).  Lindblom and  Cohen (<a href="#lin79">1979</a>) even elevate this to a definition of knowledge: knowledge is whatever is taken as the basis of a commitment or action.</li>
  <li>The use of information is experienced as making estimates and decisions (<a href="#kir02">Kirk 2002</a>). </li>
  <li>Information use may mean ways in which interpretations (knowledge) are used in problem-solving (<a href="#sav09a">Savolainen 2009a</a>). </li>
  <li>Information may be used to improve the person's psychological or physical aspects (<a href="#alf08">Al-Fedaghi 2008</a>). </li>
  <li>The use of information is experienced as the activity of affecting others, which hinges on interaction between persons. It requires not only information exchange, but also a special approach, so that other people would change their understanding and behavior. (<a href="#kir02">Kirk 2002</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>... as effects of information</h3>

<p>Sometimes, information use has been perceived as the effects which information 
  has on individuals or processes. In these cases, the actor is not active in 
  regard to the information, but the other way around: s/he is the object of 
  changes brought about by the information (cf. <a href="#kar07">Kari 2007</a>). 
  It has usually been a question of <em>individual</em> effects, or, in Robert 
  Taylor's (<a href="#tay91">1991</a>) terms, of what the information does 
  to the person and his/her problem or situation. Let us look at the matter a 
  little more closely. Studies of information use at the micro level often try 
  to identify the changes which the adopted information causes to the individual's 
  cognitive or knowledge structures (e.g.,  <a href="#sav08">Savolainen 2008</a>, 
  <a href="#sav09c">Savolainen 2009c</a>). In  Zaltman's (<a href="#zal83">1983</a>) 
  view, we could define information use as a change in the confidence which the 
  person has towards a certain information object. According to Al-Fedaghi (2008), 
  in turn, the uses of information are represented by changes which take place 
  in the person's non-informational spheres. Also Dervin's Sense-Making 
  theory suggests tha dt the effects of information reflect information use. Its 
  element <em>use</em>oes not refer as much to the use of meanings as to 
  what positive or negative follows from making meaning to the individual's 
  situation. These consequences are called <em>helps</em> and <em>hurts</em> 
  (e.g., <a href="#der82">Dervin <em>et al</em>. 1982</a>: 818, <a href="#sav00">Savolainen 
  2000</a>: 43). </p>
  
<p><em>Processual</em> effects are also mentioned in the literature treating of information 
  use. In Machlup's (<a href="#mac80">1980</a>) opinion, for example, 
  <em>use</em> must refer to the activities directed or affected by the received 
  information. In a general sense, the use of information can mean messages as 
  a part of education process in which the new information and knowledge form 
  a part of the foundation influencing future decisions and actions (<a href="#tay86">Taylor 
  1986</a>). In an empirical article by Rich, <em>use</em>, a little similarly, refers to 
  information being included in policymaking process. The potential to affect 
  a decision is a critical part of his definition of use. If information is <em>used</em>, 
  it impacts on policy decisions. (<a href="#ric77">Rich 1977</a>.)</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This paper set out to examine how the concept of information use has been 
  defined in scholarly literature. It soon became evident that different researchers 
  understand the use of information differently. Seven major conceptions thereof 
  were discovered: information use as</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>information practices - almost any kind of human interaction with information;</li>
  <li>information search - the processes of <em>information seeking</em>
and <em>information retrieval</em>;</li>
  <li>information processing - information is interpreted, analysed and modified 
(<a href="#lim98">Limberg 1998</a>);</li>
  <li>knowledge construction - mental constructs are shaped or designed to function 
as a basis for thinking (<a href="#sav09a">Savolainen 2009a</a>);</li>
  <li>information production - creating an expression of knowledge which others 
can also observe;</li>
  <li>applying information - information functions as a resource in some process;</li>
  <li>effects of information - changes brought about by information.</li>
</ul>

<p>At a more concrete level, the spectrum of competing ideas seems endless (<a href="#dun83">Dunn 
  1983</a>), or at least really wide. It is difficult to find even two sources 
  in which the use of information would be defined in the same way. Not only are 
  different phenomena referred to with the same term, but its scope also varies. 
  Sometimes, information use is considered as nearly an all-embracing concept 
  - for example as almost any kind of informational phenomenon (<a href="#hug06">Hughes 
  2006</a>); whereas, at the other extreme, information use is seen very narrowly: 
  for example, as building cognitive <em>bridges</em> (<a href="#sav06">Savolainen 
  2006</a>). Sometimes in the latter case, though, it may be that one wants to 
  <em>limit the examination</em> to a certain part of information use. What other 
  reasons can there be for the variety of conceptions? At least the researchers' 
  <em>theoretical background commitments:</em> their pre-understanding leads them 
  to define the use of information in a certain way, and they are not necessarily 
  able to see or accept other points of view. Information use can also mean different 
  things depending on the <em>context </em>(<a href="#tay86">Taylor 1986</a>). 
  For example, when Cook and Brown as well as Orlikowski approach the phenomenon 
  of information use in the context of practice - understood as a set of situational 
  actions (<a href="#sav09a">Savolainen 2009a</a>) - it is natural to understand 
  information use specifically as the application of information. </p>
  
<p>Owing to the relative comprehensivess of the source literature, it is assumed 
  that the main categories constructed in this paper cover the whole domain of 
  information use. It is thus very unlikely that there are major types of information 
  use which would have somehow escaped the analysis here. It is to be noted, however, 
  that the findings that have been presented here do not represent the eternal 
  truth, but only scholars' contemporary notions of information use. Our 
  understanding will grow with new research. Indeed, the paper at hand has merely 
  demonstrated the diversity in the conceptions of information use. While the 
  results may be useful as such in research and even practice, fashioning a systematic 
  and unifying model which could be utilized as a standard tool requires more 
  work on the main categories and the whole that they form. Also, not all notions 
  of information use are equally fruitful. The question then becomes, how to differentiate 
  between the more and less useful conceptions. These objectives will be accomplished 
  in the sequel to this paper.</p>

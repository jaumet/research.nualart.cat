<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Despite the importance of the subject of personal informaton organization behaviour, only a small number of user studies have been published concerning how people organize paper files in their offices (<a href="#kwa89">Kwasnik 1989</a> &amp; <a href="#kwa91">1991</a>), e-mails (<a href="#duc">Ducheneaut &amp; Bellotti 2001</a>; <a href="#whi">Whittaker &amp; Sidner 1996</a>), bookmarks of Web pages (<a href="#boa">Boardman &amp; Sasse 2004</a>), and objects on the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>desktop screen (<a href="#bar">Barreau &amp; Nardi 1995</a>; <a href="#rav">Ravasio <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>). One reason lies in the <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of gaining access to people's personal hard <span>drives</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> which provides the <span>principal</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>record of such behaviour. The approach we use to collect data is through a series of student group projects, where each student obtains permission from three or four friends to harvest the filenames, folder <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and file structure from the personal <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or notebook that they use at work. These <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>have to complete either a small Master's  thesis or a group project (plus an extra course) to complete the requirements for the M.Sc. (Information Studies) programme at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. We endeavour to have a group of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>every semester carry out data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and analysis, and hope to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>useful results after a few rounds of data <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> We have carried out two rounds of data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in this way.</p>

<p>The research questions that the project seeks to address <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>into three areas:</p>
<ol>
  <li> <em>File structure</em>: How are files organized into folders? What are the common types of folders and folder labels (folders are assumed to <span>represent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>categories of files)? What are the common types of files and filenames? What are the common hierarchical structures? What are the temporal, spatial and organizational <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the files and folders (for example, do some folders become obsolete and forgotten, are there <span>duplicate</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>folders, and so on)?</li>
  <li> <em>User behaviour</em>: How do users develop, <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and manage their file structures? How do they locate and retrieve information and <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>from their file structure? What problems do they encounter?</li>
  <li> <em>User cognition and perception</em>: What principles do users follow when organizing their files? What is their reason or rationale for organizing files and folders in a particular way? What <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>do they have of their file structure and their behaviour?</li>
  <li><em> Relationships between file structure, user behaviour and cognition</em>: How do user behaviour, cognition and <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>affect file organization <span>characteristics</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and vice versa? File organization on the hard <span>disk</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is related to personal information seeking behaviour&#8212;how do people locate information in their own files and personal repositories. It is hypothesized that people's preferred way of locating personal information will have an impact on how they organize their files, and vice versa.</li>
</ol>

<p>The results of this project will shed light on an important type of human <span>categorization</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>behaviour, engaged in by most knowledge workers and white collar workers today. The results will also have implications for the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of file structures in operating <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> for designing personal information <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> for designing personal work <span>spaces</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and personalization <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in enterprise portals and organizational digital repositories. Further research in the <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>will build on this base to relate folder organization and naming conventions to particular groups of people and the occupational <span>roles</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>they engage in.</p>

<p>Conducting such research becomes all the more important as information seeking activities increasingly involve the use of <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>created and distributed in digital form. Electronic file organization will affect how well and in what ways people locate and retrieve <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the course of their work with resulting impacts on work productivity and effectiveness. <span>Furthermore</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> we expect that more and more organizations will impose organization-wide file structures, and <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>employees to store files on networked file <span>servers</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> in an attempt to retain organizational memory and develop knowledge repositories, making knowledge of electronic filing behaviour even more important for the creation of efficient and participant-friendly information <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>Literature review</h2>

<p>Files and folders have of course, their non-digital counterparts and the study of how these are classified and arranged was the subject of early <span>investigation</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Using interviews and guided office tours, Malone (<a href="#mal">1983</a>) <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>two <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of desk organization, neat and messy. In his study he noted that, although not statistically generalizable, there was evidence that messy desks created retrieval problems for their owners. Malone speculated that the kind of organization chosen would often <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on occupational role. He also <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>two elementary <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of document organization: files (explicitly titled and arranged), and piles (not titled and not ordered in any logical way). The files, he noted, gave many people <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as they had a hard time deciding on a <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>scheme. He also <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that files and piles, have two functions: <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and reminding. Malone urged the designers of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>environments to take into account this later function as it was at the time of his <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>completely overlooked.</p>

<p>Kwasnik (<a href="#kwa89">1989</a>) also focused on physical desktops and relied on guided office tours for her study of how people organized their offices. However, supplementing these tours she had participants <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>a <span>day</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>s mail using the thinking-out-loud method. Kwasnik's <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was that the choices people made about <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>depended on their <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Classification was 'person- and situation- centered... not object centered' (<a href="#kwa89">Kwasnik 1989</a>). Her results suggested that people organize across <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>dimensions: <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>attributes (source, use, circumstance, and access); document attributes (author, <span>topic</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and form); disposition (discard, keep, postpone); Order/Scheme (group, <span>separate</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> arrange); Time (continuation, duration, currency), value (importance, interest, confidentiality); and <span>Cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>State (don't know, want to remember). However, of these dimensions, <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>attributes, especially use, <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to be the most common.</p>

<p>In a <a href="#bar">1995</a> article, Barreau and Nardi compared the results of their <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>investigations into the electronic filing habits of primarily inexperienced <span>DOS</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>users and experienced Mac users. They found <em>striking similarities</em> between the two groups. Rather than use built-in <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>features</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> what Barreau and Nardi <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to as logical searching, people tended to prefer location-based searching, that is, a process where the user guesses which folder a file is in, browses its content and, if the file is not found, repeats the process. Barreau speculated that this was so <em>'because it more actively engages the mind and body and imparts a greater sense of control'</em> (<a href="#bar">Barreau and Nardi 1995</a>: 40). For the Mac users, Nardi suggested that location searching was preferred because of the <em>'difficulty in remembering the name of the desired file'</em> (<a href="#bar">Barreau and Nardi 1995</a>: 40). Both authors noted that each group gave much thought to naming their files in an effort to make them easy to spot when browsing, but spent little time maintaining their file <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Barreau and Nardi made two other observations. The first was that electronic file placement served not only a retrieval function, but also acted as reminders for people to take <span>action</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>later. In this respect, the electronic <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was an <span>extension</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the physical desk. The authors speculated that this function enhanced the desirability of location-based searching as people would encounter their files more regularly. Their second observation was that files could be <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>into three categories: ephemeral (short life span), working (life span <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in weeks or months, <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>used in current work), archived (life span <span>measured</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in months or years, infrequently accessed). In <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to this <span>categorization</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Barreau and Nardi noted that although people did not archive very much, that class of information received the most <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>from <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>designers, whereas ephemeral information was neglected, even though it made up a significant number of files.</p>

<p>Given the great importance of e-mail, it is not surprising that it should receive <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the literature exploring the filing habits of users. Whittaker and Sidner (<a href="#whi">1996</a>), noted that e-mail was now used for a variety of functions, for which it was not originally <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and that this produced what they called <em>e-mail overload</em> with the inbox acting as a task manager. In their study they found that the <span>volume</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of e-mail received and the unintended task manager function made the process of filing either difficult or unrewarding for users. They identified three <span>principal</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>ways in which people handled e-mail overload depending on whether they use folders and whether they clean their inboxes daily. The first group are the no-filers. These people do not use folders, rely on periodic purges to clean their inboxes, and use the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>facilities provided by the <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to find relevant files. No-filers have trouble using the inbox as a task manager as a result. In contrast to the no-filers, frequent filers have relatively small inboxes and use lots of folders. As a result the inbox can function successfully in its second role of task manager. However, there are high maintenance costs involved which means that this strategy is best for those people who can check their mail daily and who receive relatively little mail to begin with. Finally, there are the <em>spring-cleaners</em>. These people engage in a strategy of intermittent cleanup, use lots of folders, and have large inboxes. There is not as much maintenance involved here and items are discovered before deadlines. In general, people using this strategy tend to receive fewer messages and have more time to handle them.</p>

<p>Balter also looked at the problem of e-mail filing, but from the point of view of designing a mathematical model that could predict the most efficient method of <span>storage</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and retrieval. The model took into account keystrokes, pointing and <span>mental</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>preparation times. Balter <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that 'the best long <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy is to use folders sparsely in <span>combination</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>functionality' (<a href="#bal">Balter 2000</a>: 111). The model also suggested that it is more efficient to have between four and twenty folders for manual searching, that more than thirty folders is not an efficient strategy, and that it is inefficient to conduct cleanups of the inbox as the 'gain in time a reduced number of stored messages gives is less than a few minutes a <span>day</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>   (<a href="#bal">Balter 2000</a>: 112).</p>

<p>In their study of the folder organization and file retrieval of sixty e-mail users, Ducheneaut and Bellotti (<a href="#duc">2001</a>) found a great <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in filing structure (from one inbox to 400 folders) and that the complexity <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the e-mail experience of the individual user. The folders people used tended to <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>into the following categories: sender, organization, project, and personal interests. In many cases the categorical paradigm chosen <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the nature of the wider organization of which the user was a part (projects for example in research institutions as <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to departments in well-established <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>firms). They also found that because people wanted immediate access to information, the folder hierarchies were generally shallow, typically having only two levels. Ducheneaut and Bellotti went on to challenge some aspects of Balter's model of efficient e-mail management, noting that people tend to have numbers of redundant or no longer used folders that add significant numbers to the total count. In Balter's model these redundant folders are not accounted for and so a recommendation for a smaller number of folders is made. The authors also noted a number of <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that hampered users' freedom to chose how to manage their e-mail. Among these was the convention of listing folders alphabetically, whereas users wanted to organize by priority or frequency of use. Similarly, they noted that users' felt that <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were too slow to set up and therefore of <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>attractiveness as compared to sorting and manually browsing files.</p>

<p>More recent work by Boardman and Sasse (<a href="#boa">2004</a>) examined user <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>surrounding personal information management (PIM) for three common tool types: <span>documents</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> e-mail, and Web bookmarks. In terms of organization, they <span>devised</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>a typology of three file management strategies: total filers (filing was done at the time of document creation), <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>filers (while filing was <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>done at the time of creation, many files remained unfiled until after task completion or during a spring cleanup), and occasional filers (for whom filing was not a priority). This typology was only partially transferable to the case of e-mail for which they found only a few no-filers (no folders, periodic spring-cleaning of the inbox) and some frequent filers (filing done immediately, no spring-cleaning). Most people <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to employ multiple <span>strategies</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> The authors <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>these users into two groups based on how much filing they did on a daily basis. Bookmarks also required a different typology. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>significant number of no-filers were found, but the <span>rest</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>used multiple <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>which were <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by the authors into two groups depending on how often they filed bookmarks upon creation. Boardman and Sasse also examined the <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>people assigned to folders. For files, these <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were derived from a number of common types: projects, document <span>classes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and <span>roles</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> For e-mail folders, a couple more categories had to be <span>added</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to this list; <span>namely</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> contact, topic/interest, and mailing <span>list</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Bookmarks relied on topic/interest, document class, projects, and contacts for their categories. Boardman and Sasse's users did not bother with much spring-cleaning of files and folders. Most of the spring-cleaning that was found occurred at times of '<em>major life events</em>' such as changing jobs. However, like many previous studies, the authors found that users preferred browsing as a <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy for all three tool types. However, as well as location browsing they relied on the sorting <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of their <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to help them find what they were looking for. In general, participants were confident they could find the things they needed. Boardman and Sasse raise a number of relevant issues in their discussion. They claim that the use of multiple <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by many users suggests that previous studies exaggerated the differences between people. Instead they feel that differences are to be found across differing tool types and according to the individual's <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the value of the information. They also <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that the tendency to organize may <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on personality type with tidy people tending to organize more than others. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>final point raised in their discussion is that archives, in contrast to Barreau and Nardi, were seen as valuable even if infrequently used. In order to <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with these issues, Boardman and Sasse propose two new concepts: information usefulness (active, inactive, dormant, and unassessed); and information ownership (mine, and not-mine).</p>

<p>Ravasio <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#rav">2004</a>) examined the <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and retrieval of e-mail, bookmarks and other <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for a group of sixteen participants. In terms of <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>they discovered that archiving was <em>'a decidedly important matter'</em> as such items were used in the course of people's work. As a result much work was done in creating file structures that would reveal content meaning. This work was seen as an on-going and difficult process. In contrast to archiving functions, temporary <span>storage</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was provided by the <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(but only by the experienced; inexperienced users did not realize it was possible to store their files on the desktop). As the <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>filled up with files, people tended to <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>them into three groups: those immediately useful (kept in place), valuable things (archived), and the <span>rest</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(deleted). Ravasio <em>et al.</em>, in common with most other researchers, found that people were reluctant to use <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>tools; only the highly skilled did so at all and only as a last resort. Most <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves capable of remembering where the files had been stored. To this effect, they used spatial location as a means to jog their memory. But unlike Barreau and Nardi, the authors here argue that the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>reason for people not using the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is the complexity of the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and the fact that the <em>'technical document metadata'</em> wasn't useful because it did not <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>how people thought about their files.</p>

<h2>Research method</h2>

<p>Twelve professionals participated in the study&#8212;four from each of the following industries: auditing, logistics and <span>education</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> All the subjects used PCs and a <span>Microsoft</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Windows operating system (none was a Macintosh or Unix/Linux user).</p>

<p>The data were collected from the subjects in three phases. First, a structured questionnaire was sent to the subjects to collect basic information on their personal background, work experience, and the <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of their workstation (including the location of their <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>document collection). </p>

<p>The researchers then arranged an appointment with the subject to scan the subject's hard <span>disk</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and take a screen shot of the <span>desktop</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>computer <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>called STG FolderPrint Plus was installed on the subject's workstation (to be removed at the end of the session). This <span>program</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was used to capture data such as the tree structure of the nominated drive, levels of folders, and date on which folders and files were last modified. The <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was selected for its low cost and its capability to export the data captured in various formats including <span>Microsoft</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Excel worksheet and <span>HTML</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> If the <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>system did not allow <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to be installed, then the <span>DOS</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>command &#8220;dir/s/tw&#8221; was issued at the command prompt to <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>files and folders on the hard <span>disk</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and output to a text file. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>screen shot of the subject's <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>desktop was taken to understand how the subject arranged files and folders on the <span>desktop</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>After the hard <span>disk</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>scanning, a semi-structured interview was carried out. The subject was asked open-ended questions about their <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in naming and organizing files and folders, and in locating and retrieving files. The subject was asked to think-out-loud on how and where he would save a hypothetical work document, as well as how he would retrieve an old file (identified by the interviewer after scanning the hard disk). </p>

<h2>File structure</h2>

<h3>Storage location</h3>

<p>The subjects usually stored their folders and files on their <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and/or the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>hard drive of their computer&#8212;either C drive (C:\) or D drive (D:\). Eight subjects had their <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>folders in their <em>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\My Documents</em> folder&#8212;the default document folder created by the <span>Microsoft</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Windows system. Others stored their folders in the root of their C or D drive.</p>

<h3>Organizing files on the <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>screen</h3>

<p>Seven of the twelve subjects indicated that they stored <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <span>desktop</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> The majority of the users did not arrange the files on the <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in any particular way. However, one subject made an effort to position his <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and place current files in the centre of the screen. Another subject arranged the files from left to right so that it would be easier for the eye to track the <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <span>desktop</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> which could get quite cluttered during the busy periods of his working schedule.</p>

<p>Ravasio <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#rav">2004</a>) noted that users tend to <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>screen as a temporary <span>storage</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>area. Barreau &amp; Nardi (<a href="#bar">1995</a>) also found that files on the <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were ephemeral (such as to-do items). Similarly in this study, <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>out of twelve participants used the <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to store files and folders related to their most current projects or tasks. Users would merge the files and folders on the <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with their <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>document collections upon completion of the related work. One user said he saved his <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>so he could delete them <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>later.</p>

<h3>Tree structure</h3>

<p>Files on the hard <span>disk</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are organized into folders and sub-folders. The folders and their sub-folders form a tree structure. The tree structure can have different shapes and <span>characteristics</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> The tree can be broad and shallow, with many first level folders but few levels overall. Or it can be narrow and deep, with few first level folders but many levels.</p>

<p>Five of the twelve subjects had fewer than ten first level folders. Other subjects had more than nineteen first level folders. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate a narrow and a broad tree structure. The average number of first level folders for all the users was nineteen!</p>

<p>One user had sixty-four first level folders that go a maximum of three levels deep. On the other extreme, one subject had just nine first level folders but a hierarchy that <span>reached</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>a maximum of eight levels. Six users had tree structures that were at least two levels deep, while four users had tree structures that went at least three levels down. </p>

<p>The subject with a broad and shallow tree structure created his folders based on specific work assignments or areas. Other users had more broadly defined first level folders, such as 'Work', within which they created subfolders for specific projects. Subjects with a deep file structure tend to have some kind of systematic <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>system, which sometimes included temporally labelled folders (e.g.,<em>Work\Exampapers\03041\NBS\UG\AB10103041.pdf</em>). On the other, subjects with many files in one folder tended to <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>their <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the filenames, which may contain two or more attributes. This is explained in the next section.</p>

<p>A majority of users (ten out of twelve) would only create folders if there were at least one file to place in0e. But two users would create folders with no files in them, usually in anticipation of the work required for their forthcoming projects. </p>

<h3>File and folder names</h3>

<p>The file folder <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the respondents were classified into the following categories: organizational function or structure, document type, project or client name, priority ranking, long-term <span>storage</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> miscellaneous or temporary, subject or <span>topic</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and task or area of responsibility. The <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of folder categories with examples is given in the <a href="#app">Appendix</a>. It was found that document type was the most common category of folder name with each participant having at least one folder of this type. Examples of this category are: Articles, PPT (Powerpoint), and LOA (Letters of Authorization). </p>

<p>The second most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>occurring category was organizational function or structure. Organizational function folders such as Finance or WITS (Work Improvement Teams) were present in the majority of participants' hard <span>drives</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> They did not appear, however, on the hard <span>drives</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the academics in the <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> suggesting that occupation may have an effect on folder naming <span>strategies</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<p>Not surprisingly, the miscellaneous or temporary <span>classification</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> was the <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>most <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>occurring category. Examples of this category of folders include the most obvious label, Miscellaneous, but also others such as General or Overall. More interesting was the fact that only one of the participants whose job was in the logistics industry had folder <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in this category, again suggesting that occupation may have an effect on naming and filing conventions in this case.</p>

<h2>User file management</h2>

<h3>Filing of documents</h3>

<p>The users were queried on when they would organize their files. Five of the twelve subjects indicated that they would do so when they were creating or saving the files (frequent filers), while three stated that they would only do so when they have the time (spring cleaners). The <span>rest</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the users indicated that they would do so when they could not find a document, or when the user's personal <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>performance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>started to slow down due to <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>storage</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>space. One subject said that with an external hard <span>disk</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> he no longer needed to organize his files, since his back up would be in the external hard <span>disk</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>The thinking-out-loud exercise provided additional insights on the filing behaviour and reasons for the behaviour. Nine of the twelve users would file a <span>newly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>created document in a folder, while two would save to the <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>screen, and one would place it on his D:\ drive (unless he could remember which folder was relevant). Six of the nine users who filed in a folder chose the most appropriate folder for the document at this time, based on the task or <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>associated with the document. The <span>rest</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>would put the document in a <em>catch-all</em> folder. All the nine users would create the document first, and then choose a folder or destination. Contrary to this, one user said he would first create an appropriate folder for the impending document.</p>

<h3>Clearing the <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>screen</h3>

<p>Seven of the twelve subjects stored <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on their <span>desktop</span>. <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> One user regularly cleaned up clutter on the <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>every Saturday. Another user would only clean up his <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>when <em>'something went <span>wrong</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></em> with his system and the technician recommended that the <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>had to be weeded. The <span>rest</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the users would tidy up their <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>when the work or project related to the <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>had been completed, or they <span>judged</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that the <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were no longer needed or relevant. This could be weekly, half-yearly or <em>'whenever possible'</em>. </p>

<h3>Maintaining the file structure</h3>

<p>Through the course of use, document collections accumulate <span>duplicate</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>folders, folders that fail to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>current job duties, files no longer relevant, and so on. All but two subjects said they would periodically go through their document collections to tidy up files and folders, deleting files no longer needed and adjusting the folder structure. Of the two exceptions, one subject said his work was such that old files would be needed for <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the <span>future</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> The other subject did not see the need to tidy up his collection: his maintenance <span>consisted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>mainly of backing up the entire <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Though a few users said they would carry out this task weekly or monthly, the majority would only clean up their files and folders <em>'as and when'</em> or when they had time. One of the <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><em>'cleaners'</em> reported feeling happy after a cleanup exercise because it would make files easier to find in <span>future</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Another felt good that the files would be <em>'more organized'</em>. Two subjects felt a sense of accomplishment upon completing the task, three users viewed it as a tedious but necessary chore, and one con0ered it a waste of time as he <em>'had better things to do'</em>.</p>

<h2>Retrieving documents</h2>

<p>Users can locate files in their personal document <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>either by browsing the file structure or by searching the filenames or file content. Ten of the twelve subjects used primarily the browsing approach, and two would start with filename and keyword searching. </p>

<p>The browsers would generally pick the most relevant folder (by subject, project or task) at the first level, and scan the subfolders and files within. Two subjects had multiple <span>drives</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and would have to ascertain the correct drive first. One subject would first scan the <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>screen in case the document was recent and he had stored it there. Another subject took into account the temporal attributes of the target file because his <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>folders were organized by how recent the <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were. When browsing did not work, the subjects resorted to the Search function in the Windows system. There were two exceptions. One user did not know the Search function existed. Another user knew about the Search function but preferred <em>'to retrieve by memory'</em>.</p>

<p>It is not known whether the subjects had a rough idea where in the tree structure the file was likely to be located before <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to browse, or whether they selected the categories level-by-level as they browsed the folder structure</p>

<p>Two subjects used primarily the Search function to locate files, although it is not known whether they searched by filename or perform keyword <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the file content. One subject said he had too many files and would not remember where <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>he had placed a file (especially old files). But if he <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to locate a file by searching, he would <em>'plough through'</em> his entire <span>collection</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have carried out a small preliminary study of how twelve subjects managed and organized their electronic files on their <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>hard <span>disk</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>at their workplace. The results are generally consistent with the results of previous studies of how people manage and organize paper files in their office, e-mails and bookmarks.</p>

<p>The majority of the subjects stored files on both their <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as well as in a folder on their hard drive. The <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>tended to be used for ephemeral or temporary files as well as for working files used in current projects. The <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>desktop <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to serve the function of Malone's (<a href="#mal">1983</a>) piles, reminding the user of tasks to be completed or needing <span>attention</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> It also helps users to locate working files quickly. Some subjects positioned their files on the <span>desktop</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>spatially (e.g., working <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the centre of the screen) or chronologically, presumably to be more effective in reminding them of tasks to be completed or help them locate working <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>quickly.</p>

<p>The hard <span>disk</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>folders are used to store and organize working files and archived files. Some users may have a <em>catch-all</em> folder that serves as a pile of <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to be sorted or attended to later. Users may also have an external hard <span>disk</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or networked file server for archiving or backing up files.</p>

<p>The subjects organized their folders and sub-folders in a variety of tree structures, from broad and shallow hierarchies to narrow and deep hierarchies. Most subjects had one to three levels of folders, with one extreme case with eight levels.</p>

<p>Consistent with Kwasnik's (<a href="#kwa89">1989</a>) <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for paper files, we found that the labels for first level folders tended to be task-based or project-based, corresponding to Kwasnik's <em>use</em> dimension. However, our data also suggests that users employing a shallow folder structure tend to created task-based or project-based folders at the first level, whereas users with a deep folder structure tend to use broader and more generic folder <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>at the first level. The folder labels used with deep file structures tend to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>some kind of systematic <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>system. On the other, subjects with many files in one folder tend to <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>their <span>classification</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in the filenames, which may contain two or more attributes.</p>

<p>Most of the subjects in the study were <em>frequent filers</em> who stored <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>into appropriate folders immediately, or <em>spring cleaners</em> who clean up and file <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>into folders periodically. As with the subjects in Barreau and Nardi's (<a href="#bar">1995</a>) study, most of the subjects in this study preferred to locate files by browsing or navigating the folder structure, and only resort to searching when they <span>failed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to locate the file by browsing.</p>

<p>Folder naming conventions were <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and classified into a number of categories. Of these the most common categories were document type, organizational function or structure, and miscellaneous or temporary. The last two categories appear related to occupation, as organizational function folders were not found on the hard <span>drives</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the academic participants, and miscellaneous folders were not found on the hard <span>drives</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of most of those participants in the logistics industry.</p>

<p>We are continuing with the project using the same method described in the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and hope to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in this way a more representative <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>from which significant conclusions can be <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in regards to the relationship between folder structure and naming conventions, occupational <span>roles</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and accompanying information seeking behaviour. </p>

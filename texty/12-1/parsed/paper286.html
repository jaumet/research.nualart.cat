<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>This paper is an initial report from an <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>study that is part of a continuing project for which the ultimate goal is to make recommendations for structural and procedural changes in the communicative aspects of the user and audience studies enterprise.</p>

<p>What we mean by communicative aspects is that research consists of many acts of internal and external communicating and, hence, can be examined systematically as communication activity.  It is communication activity that at least in part builds and destroys bridges between disciplines and perspectives; it is communication activity that allows us to advance our work; it is also communication activity that deters us from advancing our work.  It is communication activity that <span>drives</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>every step of the research process.  Rarely, however, does one find systematic <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>paid to how communicating is done in the research enterprise.  This, at the most general level, is the purpose of this project. (<a href="#Acknowledge1">1</a>)</p> 

<p>This paper is the first of two interconnected papers appearing in this issue of <em>Information Research</em>.  This paper reports on a <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>study that compared what experts in three fields, library and information science, human <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and communication and media studies, described as their big unanswered questions about users and audiences of information, library, electronic, communication and media <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and texts.  It also compares what these experts thought about each other and the <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of crossing the <span>divides</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>between disciplines or fields and between research and practice. </p>

<p>The second paper consists of a philosophic commentary focusing on research as communicating, drawing out implications for collaboration across disciplinary and research-practice <span>divides</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>for those of us who conduct and apply user and audience studies.  It is in the second paper, for example, that we attend to the philosophic legacies that are at one and the same time strengths of scholarly efforts to acquire more useful pictures of the world and weaknesses inhibiting our attempts to learn from each other and build on each others efforts.</p>

<p>The <span>impetus</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>for the first paper came from the authors' attempts to bring to bear on <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>communication questions literature from different fields that were, to our <span>minds</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> addressing the same questions.  Thus, for example, if we look at studies on information seeking and use in the fields of communication and library and information science we find that the two rarely meet.  Or, we examine the <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>work derived from different theories of what audiences get from media, again the two rarely meet.  Or, if we look at work on user uses of information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>versus audience uses of media <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> again the two do not meet.  One does not have to look far to find researchers lamenting how we are drowning in avalanches of disconnected <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and producing work that 'piles up, but does not add up'.  Further, one does not have to look far to find researchers lamenting the fact that even our many attempts at building theories, models and syntheses to bring order out of the chaos are, in fact, adding to the cacophony.  The intent of this paper is to document in the terrain of user studies the fact that, while individually some of us may feel as if we are making progress, collectively we appear to be in disarray.  Worse, as we will note below, that disarray embeds within itself some dangers to user and audience studies enterprises. (<a href="#Acknowledge2">2</a>)</p>

<p>The purpose for <a href="paper287.html" target="_blank">the Keynote paper</a> is to bring to bear on the portrait we develop from this paper a <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>we call a communicative view of communication.  Along with the endless calls for more collaboration across our <span>divides</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> there are, of course, endless calls for more communication as if these processes magically happen by intention alone.  Evidence clearly suggests that they do not, that communicating and collaborating across <span>divides</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>is hard.  Further, evidence suggests that many of the normative views we have of communication prevent us from looking at communication as process rather than outcome.  In this paper, we propose a way of looking at communication that refocuses our <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>away from the idea that communication is something we can do to do research better, to the idea that research fundamentally involves a large repertoire of potential communications,  some often used, some originally mandated for good scholarship but now too often ignored and some in need of <span>invention</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> </p>

<h2>Rationale and background</h2>

<h3>Why user and audience studies:  given a user by any other name; given information by any other name</h3>

<p>In this paper we will apply the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>users to refer to a wide variety of persons who have been conceptualized in one way or another as the voluntary or <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>users of information, media or communication systems: citizens, employees, patients, patrons, audiences, <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> clients, customers, constituencies, recipients and so on.  Every institution whose efforts point in some way at groups of such <em>users</em> is building electronic interfaces for doing so; <em>users</em>, too, are building their own interfaces that, in turn, impact upon institutions.   For simplicity's sake, we will use the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><em>users</em> <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>this article although we are deliberately enlarging the <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>meanings for the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>as discussed in this section. </p>

<p>The largest traditional cut across all these persons has traditionally been the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on users versus audiences with user and audience studies being historically disparate enterprises.  Few researchers have focused on both; few have defined the two as synonymous. Users have traditionally been those persons who voluntarily made use of information and communication systems; e.g., library patrons, museum attendees.  Or, they have been those persons that an information or communication system was in some way mandated to serve; e.g.,  the citizens 'served' by a city's or museum system; the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>at a university served by an academic library; the employees <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to use an organization's knowledge management system.  Users have been thought of traditionally as individuals each of whom at least conceptually was served as an individual and for whom the bottom <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>has been whether that <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>was served.  Systems have traditionally cared about meeting individual user needs. (<a href="#Acknowledge3">3</a>)</p>

<p>The literature is filled, of course, with nuanced arguments which trouble this <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to users.  Two <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>ones are:  a) whether we should be focusing on users, use, uses, usability and so on and what differences these differences make;  and b) whether these user-oriented terms privilege <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>over people by rhetorically making <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and use of them the center of <span>attention</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>   We acknowledge these complexities although for our <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>here will <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>overarching polarization. (<a href="#Acknowledge4">4</a>)</p>

<p>In contrast, audiences have traditionally been defined as amorphous groups of individuals that communication,  media and information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>attract or entice with arrays of offerings of particular genres, programme types, or content.  Traditionally, <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>have not worried about whether any given specific member of an audience was served but rather how many paid <span>attention</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  The bottom <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>has traditionally been audience counts even to the extent to which political economists have argued that such <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>have little interest in serving individual audience member needs.  Rather, the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>has been on audiences as commodities; as <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of economic value to the system. <span>Sometimes</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>this economic value is profit oriented, as in television <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>programming; sometimes it is oriented towards  societal cost reductions, as in public communication campaigns. (<a href="#Acknowledge5">5</a>)  </p>

<p>While, clearly, there have been researchers who have defined these divisions between users and audiences as system-imposed artificialities, there is little <span>doubt</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>that, traditionally, these divisions have driven research in the library and information science versus communication fields with the former focusing on users, the latter audiences.  Human-computer <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>is a 'Johnny-come-lately' to user studies transitioning its attentions from physioloigical and functional usability <em>per se</em> to users in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to its enlarged and diversified role in the face of the <span>remarkable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>diffusion of electronic technologies.</p>

<p>Of course, another polarity, that between texts and messages defined as <em>information</em> versus those defined in some way as <em>not information</em>, is a large part of the foundation on which the <span>distinctions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>between users and audiences have rested.  Traditionally, users were voluntarily getting informed, while audiences were either voluntarily getting entertained or being persuaded or <em>educated</em> to become informed in particular and sometimes deliberately biased ways.  These traditional facile <span>distinctions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>between <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of information, <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of media content and <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of utilities or gratifications users and audiences get from <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>have long been challenged both by information science and communication <span>theorists</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>as well as by a host of philosophers. (<a href="#Acknowledge6">6</a>)  </p>

<p>In the fast-moving maelstrom of the advance of the electronic technologies, these traditionally neat divisions between users and audiences, information and not-information are clearly falling apart.  Audiences and users are becoming one.  What was traditionally defined as information and its <span>opposite</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><em>not-information</em> have, much to the distress of those interested in information authority, become, in the <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>world of everyday experience, a jumble.</p>

<p>Presenting a <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>review of the literature supporting these premises is beyond our purpose here.  Suffice it to say that evidence supports three observations:</p>


<ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
<li>That users by any other name, citizens, lay persons, patients, patrons, participants, attendees, viewers, game players and so on, increasingly have greater and greater control over their access and use of all manner of information and entertainment <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  In this sense they are no longer best conceptualized as users or as audiences but rather as persons with agency.  While in the past access was highly constrained both in space and in time by institutional availability, now these independent agents may surf the planet and beyond at their own whims.  This is so even when we acknowledge that all users are unwittingly or wittingly constrained by political economies that <span>limit</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>both arrays of offerings, <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of access and availabilities of specific contents. </li>

<li>That information, communication and media institutions are themselves undergoing a maelstrom of change whose directions and ends are predictable in only the most <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of ways.  The traditional task divisions between institutions are collapsing; the traditional safe market 'niches' are being eroded; the traditional divisions between <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of content (e.g.,  entertainment versus information) are collapsing.</li>

<li>That in actuality, when examined from a communication <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> the historical divisions between <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of users, <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of content were never tenable.  The <span>distinctions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>looked as if they were tenable given the constraints of the designs of information, media and communication structures.  But individual sense-makers have always struggled to navigate the crisp <span>divides</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>that institutions have <span>attempted</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>between their edifices.  And, individual sense-makers have always had to struggle with the gaps between and the ways in which societally imposed <span>beliefs</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and normative forms have been less than useful to their lived experiences.  What is happening as the result of the maelstrom of changes impelled by the emerging electronic confluence is that these communication realities have become more obvious.  They were in the past relatively quiescent.  Now they bubble to the surface in numerous ways. (<a href="#Acknowledge7">7</a>)</li>
</ol>


<p>It is small wonder that in the face of these changes we find ever increasing <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>being placed in all the professions that create <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>designed to serve and/or attract users on understanding <em>users</em>, by whatever <span>names</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>they may be called in order to construct more useful communication <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> designs and messages and in order to find a competitive niche whether for <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of service and/or profit. (<a href="#Acknowledge8">8</a>)</p>

<p>It is also small wonder that researchers in virtually every field that supports these professions are jumping on the user studies bandwagon.  This is as true, for example, of the fields of <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>art</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and social work as it is for the three fields, library and information science, human <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and communication, that form our <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>focus in this paper. (<a href="#Acknowledge9">9</a>)</p>

<h3>Do user and audience studies matter?  To whom?</h3>

<p>The issue of whether user and audience studies matter has for <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of this paper three interrelated manifestations. One is whether user and audience studies conducted in one <span>discipline</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>matter to researchers in different disciplines.  The second is whether these studies matter to practitioners who are the ones designing and implementing <span>systems</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>is whether they matter to society as a whole.</p>
 
<p>The first two <span>divides</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>are the <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of this paper.  There is much informal talk and a smattering of  <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>work, which suggests that user studies completed in one <span>discipline</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>matter little to researchers in other  disciplines and that practitioners find little value in the results obtained from user studies.  Because of the dearth  of the evidence amid much informal talk, we explicitly asked both researchers and practitioners in the three fields most involved with user studies, library and information science, human <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and communication,  what they saw as the barriers hindering collaboration and research <span>utility</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>across disciplinary and research-practice <span>divides</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#Acknowledge10">10</a>) </p>
 
<p>While it is beyond our <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>purpose here, it is important to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on the <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>divide, that between user research and society.  We found no commentary that addressed this issue specifically in the context of user studies, but we found a great <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>addressing it in the wider context of the social sciences.  In general, it can be said that there is increasing <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of interest and increasing distrust in the social sciences, worldwide, by policy makers and the general citizenry.</p>

<p>Indeed, society does ask social scientists to <span>rise</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to instrumental challenges: find out why bad events happens so we can fix or eliminate them; <span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>out how to persuade people to do x and stop doing y.  Even here, however, the fact is that social sciences produce an avalanche of studies on virtually every <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and that these often disagree not only in method and approach but results.  The plethora of studies and the disagreements coupled with the highly specialized vocabularies in which social scientists <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>within their discourse communities further exacerbates the problem of the gap between social science researchers and society.</p>

<p>The <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>is further compounded by an increase of commentary arguing fervently either for or against the social sciences.  Amongst the former, we see arguments for a return to the traditional emphases of the social sciences on more humanistic issues of equity and human struggle and less engagement with nation states attempting to control and manipulate citizens.  Among the latter, by far the loudest and most fervent, are those who are either against the social sciences for any but the most instrumental <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and those who are entirely against them.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>sub-argument within this debate is between those who see value in the social sciences as <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of social engineering and those for whom the goals of societal engineering are seen as irrelevant, even detrimental to society. (<a href="#Acknowledge11">11</a>)</p>

<p>Increasingly, then, the question is overtly being raised: 'Do the social sciences matter?'  While most generally manifested as an argument between more liberal versus more conservative observers, the increasing frequency and fervour of the debate cannot be ignored.  It is itself a maelstrom in which user studies are caught. It is certainly a maelstrom which has impacted the availability of funding for user studies as well as restricted the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of questions con0ered fundable.</p>

<p>It is both the fortune and misfortune of those interested in conducting and applying user studies to be doing so at this juncture in history.  The <span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>behind this current study is that the forces and tensions enumerated above plague user studies and have given <span>rise</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to a pulse of interest in <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>ways to make user studies matter by fostering collaboration between researchers in multiple fields and practitioners in multiple fields.  While there are rampant disagreements on what it might mean for user studies to matter, there is clearly widespread agreement that those interested in user studies want them to matter more.  It is this well-meaning pulse with which we <span>agree</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>that was <span>impetus</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>for this study.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<h3>The dialogue project</h3>

<p>The study reported here is part of a <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>multi-stage project, a dialogic surround of how researchers and practitioners in three fields look at:  a) the big unanswered questions about users; b) the gaps that stand between them in <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>value from each other's work; and c) the barriers to collaborating in the application of user research to system development, implementation and <span>design</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>In order to fully explain why this study and analysis have been structured as they have, it is necessary to set these efforts in the context of the <span>larger</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>project.  The project has been <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>as a dialogic surround in six stages.  The concept of a dialogic surround is illustrated first by describing the project's stages.  In the next section, a dialogic surround is defined conceptually in terms of the particular relevance of the concept to the analysis presented here.</p>

<ul>
<li>Round 1:  the interviews that we are analyzing here constitute the first of the six stages.</li>

<li>Round 2:  volunteers from among the interviewees (working with graduate <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and invited colleagues) <span>wrote</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>impressionistic essays focusing on their <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of divergences and convergences in the interviews. The opportunity to write impressionistic essays will continue to be open for at least a year. As of this <span>writing</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> forty-eight impressionistic essays have been written and are posted online.  Stage 2 essayists were asked to identify convergences and divergences between the interviews.  They were asked not to evaluate or propose their own <span>solutions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span></li>

<li>Round 3:  this article is the first systematic thematic analysis <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>from the Stage 1 interviews.  It has been <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>explicitly to serve the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of early dialogic stages.  Like the stage 2 essays, it does not propose 'right' answers or take 0es. Rather, it focuses very generally on what we learned from our interviewees about their convergences and the extent and diversity of their divergences.  </li>

<li>Round 4:  panels focusing on stages 1 and 2 are already included in the programme for the 2006 meeting of the American Society for Information Science and Technology and tentatively planned as a submission for the 2008 meeting of Association of <span>Computing</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>Machinery, Special Interest Group <span>Computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><span>Human</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>Interaction.

<h3>The nature of a dialogic surround and its relationship to this study</h3>

<p>Drawn from Dervin's development of the Sense-Making Methodology, <em>dialogic surround</em>, as used in this article, is a concept <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to capture in one <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>the need to procedurally implement repeated rounds of communicating in dialogues where the intent is to enable people to hear how others construct their <span>worlds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>in such a way that the hearing can become fodder for active sense-making rather than knee-jerk argument and <span>resistance</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> (<a href="#Acknowledge13">13</a>)</p>

<p>It is beyond the purpose of this paper to explicate fully the <span>empirical</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> theoretic and philosophic underpinnings of the Sense-Making approach to dialogue.  Sufficient for our <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>here is specification of these ten procedural mandates which serve as underpinnings for all stages of a Sense-Making informed dialogue.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><span>assumption</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>behind these mandates is that communicating activities, the verbs of communication, can be explicitly tailored to communicative <span>purposes</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  Evidence from Sense Making studies of dialogue suggests that there are at least three basic needs in dialogue: 1) understanding and thinking about self; 2) understanding and thinking about others; 3) sharing and advancing own views to others. Our research suggests that these rarely can happen simultaneously. The procedure mandates in a Sense-Making-informed dialogue are: </p>


<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>Include both intra- and inter- personal communicating as legitimate aspects of total dialogic processes.</li>
<li>Mandate participants to strengthen their communicative repertoire capacities so they can use different behaviour when <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>are to understand and comprehend others versus when <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>are to critique, evaluate, teach, or propose <span>solutions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span></li>
<li>Implement specific procedures for some rounds in the dialogue in which the only <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>are listening and analyzing as <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of judgment as possible.</li>
<li>Bracket, for the <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of dialogue, the traditional emphases in social science interviewing on controlling the assumed biases of selectivity processes, selective <span>perception</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> retention and recall, in favour of procedures that invite talkers to explain fully how they came to their views.</li>
<li>Break out of habitual and often hegemonic <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of communicating by asking different <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of questions based on human <span>universals</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of movement through time-space rather than based on the nouns of any given discourse <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>or institutional formation.</li>
<li>Build enforced anonymity into some communicating processes, particularly at the earliest stages of dialogue, so participants will be able to <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>freely about both their struggles within <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and their successes.</li>
<li>Allow participants (including interviewees) to <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>multiple facets and be <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>express</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>inconsistent views which they are invited to navigate with their own <span>explanations</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span></li>
<li>Build in questions that iteratively invite participants to make <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>between their internal sense-making and their understandings of the material and structural conditions in which they are embedded.</li>
<li>Implement multiple rounds of communicating both within single interviews and within collective dialogues to facilitate the interplay between the conscious and the unconscious in human sense-making.</li>
<li>Invite participants to talk not only about what is but also about what might be particularly in the context of the ways in which they have struggled with specific hindrances they have identified.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the project for which the study reported here serves as stage 1, these procedural mandates were applied.  Specifically, they have informed both our <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>for interviewing and analyzing the stage 1 interviews as reported in this paper.</p>

<h3>The stage 1 informants</h3>

<p>Two groups of informants were interviewed in stage 1.  One group, consisting of eighty-three informants, is called the international expert <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  The second, consisting of thirty-one informants, is called the local expert <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  Each is described briefly here.  For more detail, readers may consult the dialogue project Website.</p>

<h3>International expert sample</h3>

<p>The international expert <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>is a <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>that must be admittedly described as having come together by implosion.  The original plan was to use a set of ten to twelve interviews with national and international expert researchers and practitioners in our three focal fields to inform an IMLS-funded research project focusing on the hows and whys of user satisficing of their information needs.  By the time interviewing was completed, there were, <span>instead</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> eighty-three interviews with an effort <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>about 10% by grant funds and 90% by <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>volunteer efforts and <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of resources by some 180 people at multiple institutions. (<a href="#Acknowledge14">14</a>)</p>

<p>After completing the first twelve interviews, it had become obvious that there was both more agreement than we <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>as well as more <span>disagreement</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  We did not expect informants, for example, to concur so much on the struggles of crossing field and research-practice <span>divides</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>in user studies.  At the same time, we did not expect such widespread divergence in what informants said, the premises from which they started and the very ways in which they talked.  Nor did we expect that the divergencies did not link clearly to particular fields or even to practitioner versus research differences. </p>

<p>In addition, unexpectedly, the first twelve informants were extraordinarily excited by their interviews and suggested other possible informants.  Given a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of funds for paying informants and our desire to interview luminaries in the three fields, our <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>means of identifying possible informants was by nomination and personal appeal, primarily from the senior author but also by each successive group of informants.  Every effort was made, within resource <span>limits</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> to achieve a reasonably balanced <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  Further, the standard <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>rule for interviewing cessation was applied; interviewing <span>continued</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>until we <span>concluded</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>that additional effort could yield little additional diversity in input given available resources.</p>

<p>There were some obvious limitations in the process.  While the final <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>consisted primarily of well known top-level experts, many con0ered international luminaries, only ten were not current re0ents of the U.S.  On the other hand, an examination of dossiers showed that an additional twelve were recent re0ents and substantially more than half had had non-US experiences, some quite <span>extensive</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  Informants insisted we extend our interviewing <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>the U.S. because of the obvious globalization of the electronic confluence and known differences in how researchers on different continents conceptualize users and audiences.  We accomplished this to a small extent given budget constraints.</p>

<p>The <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>also clearly favoured academics, most of whom had current or former practitioner experience.  However, only 17% of the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>consisted of experts currently employed full-time as practitioners.  While the communication and library and information science field <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>were relatively 'pure', i.e., peopled mostly by individuals with <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>degrees at least in these core subjects, the human <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>was less so.  Only about two-thirds of these informants came from <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>science and engineering <span>backgrounds</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  The <span>rest</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>were individuals highly involved in system <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>who had gravitated there from other <span>backgrounds</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 

<p>We see these limitations as having relatively little impact on the <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>we present here which <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on communication issues rather than substantive differences.  These limitations will need to be actively engaged in planned further <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of this data.  Table 1 describes the resulting <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of international experts.</p>

<h3>Local expert sample</h3>

<p>The local expert interviews <span>consisted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of a total of thirty-one individual and <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>group interviews with directors of the academic and public libraries serving the forty-four colleges and <span>universities</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>Ohio, the designated institutions from which the user <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>was <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>for the IMLS-funded research project. (<a href="#Acknowledge15">15</a>)</p>

<p>A total of seventy-nine academic and public libraries served these forty-four institutions.  Of these, 31 (39.2%) directors or their representatives attended a <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>long session at which both the individual and group interviews were collected.  Of the 31, 24 (77.4%) were academic librarians; 7 (22.6%) were public librarians.  Table 2  compares the academic librarian <span>distribution</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>by the institution's student enrollment <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and by institution support base.  Other than academic rank (faculty, graduate student, undergraduate), an institution's student enrollment <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>was the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>factor used in constructing the stratified proportionate <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of informants in the user study.

<h3>Stage 1 interviews</h3>

<p>Interviewing for both the international and local experts was informed by Sense-Making Methodology's interviewing approach.  While the venues for interviewing differed, the focal questions aligned as closely as possible.  Both sets of interviews focused on how informants viewed gaps: a) in understanding users; b) between researchers in different fields; and, c) between researchers and practitioners.  They were also asked for their <em>magic wands</em> for research or procedures that would be especially helpful in alleviating gaps.  Each set of interviewing <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>is described briefly here.</p>

<h3>Interviews with international experts</h3>

<p>A few of the international experts were interviewed in person; most by phone; and all at times set by prior appointment.  Interviews were recorded and took, on average, forty-five minutes.  Interviewers included both senior project personnel as well as Ohio State University <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>at all levels, undergraduate, Master's and doctoral.  </p>

<p>Interviewers were trained in navigating the Sense-Making approach to interviewing with its <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on gaps, how gaps hinder, how participants struggle with gaps, how gaps are or might be bridged and how bridging gaps might help.  In Sense-Making's theory of dialogue, it is answers to these gap identifying and bridging queries that allow people from different discourse communities to begin to understand each other.  The interview script provided the <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>structure organized in four sets of questions as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li>About users and audiences 
<ol>
<li>
What in your judgment are the big unanswered questions about users and audiences and their uses of library,  information and communication systems?   <strong><em>For each big question</em></strong>:  How would an answer to that question help or facilitate your work or research? In your judgment, what explains why this question is not yet answered?</li>
<li>
What are the biggest challenges the advance of electronic information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>present to library/ information/ communication <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>in serving users/audiences well?  <strong><em>For each challenge</em></strong>: What would help or facilitate facing this challenge?</li>
<li>
What would make user research more useful to library/ information/ communication system <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and practice?  <strong><em>For each suggestion</em></strong>:  How would this in particular help?
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>About gaps between fields and disciplines
<ol type="1" start="4">
<li>
Have you found the many different <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and fields focusing on user and  audience research hindering in any way?  <strong><em>For each hindrance</em></strong>:  How has it hindered?  If you could wave a magic wand, what would help?

<ol type="1" start="8">
<li>If you could wave a magic wand and had any amount of money, what would you like to see a big study of users or audiences do?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The interviewer's goal was to cover all the focal questions without behaving like an interviewing robot  because persons operating in different fields do not think about users and audiences in the same way. Often the interviews started with a negotiation about what 'users' or 'audiences' to talk about and what 'systems' and how to name these entities.  This was a particular requirement in interviewing some communication academics who defined themselves not as focusing on users or audiences but rather on human beings (in various sub-categories) who happen to use <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>in their life struggles and journeys.</p>

<h3>Interviews with local experts</h3>

<p>In the Sense-Making approach to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>group interviews, informants are simultaneously involved in self-interviewing (through keeping diaries or journals) and group <span>discussions</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  For this study, on the <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>the local experts convened, informants were given individual workbooks with one page for each focal question.  Individual journal <span>entries</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>involved informants in entering their 'sense-makings' as they came to them in four different boxes as each focal question was discussed.</p>

<ol>
<li>My thoughts in answer to these questions.</li> 
<li>What I <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>agreed with and why.</li>

<li>What I would most like to see your project do [in its user study].</li>
</ol>

<p>The ten focal questions replicated the focal questions used for the international expert interviews although stated somewhat differently so as to apply more <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to the practice context.</p>

<p>Participation then proceeded in rounds first focusing on questions 1-5, then 6-9 and finally 10.  Each round <span>consisted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of solo journal keeping, group discussion coupled with self-journals and group breakout reports coupled with self-journals.  At the end of the <span>day</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> informants handed in their workbooks and the posters from group breakout reports were collected.  These once transcribed and edited <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>the local expert database.</p>
 
 <h3>Interview transcriptions</h3>
 
 <p>Both sources of interviewing input, the audio tapes from the international expert interviews and the written input  from the local expert interviews, were initially transcribed using the smooth verbatim approach, eliminating repetitions  and non-fluencies.  <span>Standard</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>control procedures usually used in <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>research were applied.  The final  transcriptions were content edited to remove non-fluencies and <span>grammatical</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>errors and repetitions common to oral talk while still retaining the informant's words.  Final versions removed all nouns and descriptors that might identify informants, their institutions, their specific projects, or their specific specialties when these were unique to them.  This was done  for two reasons:  1) Because the <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to communication gaps, which was the mandate for this project,  required deep  anonymity by many of the informants, particularly some of the international expert luminaries.  2) Because the first stage  of a Sense-Making-informed dialogue almost always involves anonymity.  In this study, this was particularly important because it was vital that <span>interpreters</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>in latter rounds would not be spending their time focusing on which luminary in  which field said what and then using stereotypes to frame their <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of what informants said.  All  informants were sent their transcriptions for final consent to participate.  All gave consent.  Institutional review of contact procedures, consent forms and informant protections were duly approved at Ohio State University for both sets of  interviews.</p>
 
 <h3>The thematic analysis</h3>
 
 <p>The thematic analysis presented here was developed to highlight issues of communication as these informants described  them.  It was not our intent to fix a systematic <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of what informants saw as the substantive nature of their  gaps and <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to them, or to do a <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of what was said between fields, work foci, or institutional <span>contexts</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>   These <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>are planned for later efforts.  Our purpose was to capture a broad impressionistic portrait of the struggles these informants reported having across disciplinary and research-practice <span>divides</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>in their internal and external sense-making efforts, in short in their communicatings.</p>
 
 <p>As an example of our <span>emphasis</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> readers will see that in the thematic analysis we do lay out a number of themes  enumerating various ways in which informants disagreed with each other on what they thought would make user studies better.  Our intent in developing this enumeration was to provide a portrait of the quantitative extent to which informants disagreed and the large variety of differing <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>they were playing with.  Having a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of these <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of differences is an <span>essential</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>starting place for <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>more <span>advanced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>stages of dialogue.</p>
 
 <p>Our approach to extracting themes was based on intersecting the inductive procedures of the method of <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>comparative coding developed in early grounded theory with the <span>deductive</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> meta-theoretic emphases of Sense-Making on gaps and gap-bridgings.  Because it is polarizations, both explicit and implicit, enduring or temporary, <span>justified</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and imagined, that most hinder communication, we adopted the approach often used in <span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>Delphi</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><span>Method</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and applied a dialectical lens to <span>zero</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>in on polarizations that leapt off the transcription pages in three senses:  1) those where informants were explicitly comparing two different approaches;  2) those where informants were comparing what is to what might be; 3) those <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>absences versus presences in talk, as, for example, where there was much <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>in the interviews on problems but despite specific interviewing queries relatively little <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>solutions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  (<a href="#Acknowledge16">16</a>)</p>
 
 <p>Because our <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>was placed on communication struggles, it was vital that we not homogenize differences.  For this reason, we chose the quotable quote as our unit of analysis and selected quotable quotes representing themes roughly in proportion to their presence in the 602 single-spaced manuscript pages of transcription (545 for international experts; fifty-seven for local experts).</p>
 
 <p>Arriving at an approach for presenting the results was not straightforward because our specification of themes was <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>conceptual and informed by a body of work on the structuring of dialogues for bridging gaps.  Because of this our <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to the transcripts was <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>pointed several <span>abstraction</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>levels above where the usual substantive thematic <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>start.  In judging both what <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>themes to use and what sub-themes to nest within them, we required 100% agreement between the two authors.</p>
 
 <p>The resulting thematic analysis is organized into twelve <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>themes with from three to nine sub-themes each for a total of seventy-five sub-themes.  In order to emphasize the ways in which the themes address our <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>foci on research as communication and communication as research, we present the themes as if the 114 informants are <span>speaking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to us personally, describing themselves in terms of their agreements, disagreements and struggles.</p>
 
 <p>While at a meta-level our themes were <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>anchored on <span>abstract</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>communication principles, we also deliberately allowed the warrant of the data to mandate <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>sub-themes.  We chose this strategy because we wanted at one and the same time to present a thematic analysis which would allow us to draw out implications for communication and to show the diversity within.  For this reason we have separated our thematic <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>into two parts.  The first is Table 3 below which lists the themes and sub-themes.  Deliberately in the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>body of this paper we did not attempt to explain and explore the substantive meanings from which we gleaned these themes.  In the <a href="#app">Appendix</a> we again <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>the themes and sub-themes, this time illustrated with the 320 quotable quote <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>which we mined and ascribed to each of them. The Table 3 items are linked to the <span>Appendix</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>so that readers may navigate between. Deliberately again we did not apply another level of conceptual definition and analysis above the exemplar quotes and the  themes.  In <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>with the procedures mandated for the dialogue project of which this thematic analysis is a part, the intent is to present the portrait of themes in as non-judgmental and dialogic a manner as possible and to retain not only the most centrally relevant quotes within a sub-theme but those at the margins as well.  </p>

<p>Because the theory of dialogue on which this project is based mandates several rounds focusing on listening and understanding before any attempts to engaging in substantive comparisons and evaluations, the thematic analysis presented here is con0ered one of many.   As described above, readers can find on the dialogue project Website a series of stage 2 impressionistic essays mandated to <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>the same task that this thematic analysis addressed with the exception that this thematic analysis represents 100% coverage of the stage 1 interviews and an imposed requirement of 100% agreement between the co-authors.  Any reader who wishes to may join the dialogue by applying to become a stage 2 essayist.  Instructions are given on the project Website. (<a href="#Acknowledge17">17</a>)</p>

<p>We already know, because as of this <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>some 48 impressionistic essays have been contributed, that there are mind-boggling differences in what essayists see as the covergencies and divergencies between our stage 1 informants.  For this reason, we do not present our thematic analysis as <em>the</em> thematic analysis but rather as one analysis of potentially many that is at one and the same time both highly informed by and highly prejudiced by an anchoring in <span>interpretive</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>communication theorizings as well as untold biases in our own perspectives of which we are not aware.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>For those of us interested in user and audience studies, many of us in the three communities studied here <span>naturally</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>feel impelled to intervene with our many suggestions, our well thought out theories, our arduously collected data, of why this or that concept or approach will resolve this or that <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>or bridge this or that gap.  </p>

<p>But, alas, that is communicatively the crux of our problem.   Yes, our informants were calling for synthesis but at the same time they were decrying their inability to comprehend syntheses written in other tongues by alien beings.  Yes, some wanted more theories and models but some, and sometimes the very same persons, said they were drowning in disconnected theories and models.  Yes, they found many things to criticize, about communication across <span>divides</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> but in actuality they had few <span>solutions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> Yes, most of our informants wanted to communicate and share with each other but they saw formidable barriers of power, structure, tradition and habit standing in the way.</p>

<p>Yes, one could see evidence of stereotypes between our <span>divides</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> how practitioners were more likely to distrust researchers and how researchers were more likely to think practitioners uninformed;  how HCI people were accused of caring only about their machines and user studies people were accused of being fluffy; or, how communication researchers did not seem to talk to practitioners hardly at all and were so internally <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>that they <span>formed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>disparate sub-fields within themselves; or, how people in librarianship and information science were  accused of being too obsessed with their library institutions.</p>

<p>But, the fact is that these stereotypes were a minor key.  In fact, perhaps what struck us most was how more often than not we could not predict what field an informant was from by what the informant said; or how often informants were self-reflexively critical of the constraints embedded in their own discourse communities and <span>purposes</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  Likewise, we were struck by an overall sense of a collision between negatives and positives.  On the negative 0e, there was befuddlement about the chaos of the state of affairs in user studies, an almost resigned disappointment that communication was not going well either across fields or across the research-practice divide and a sense of hopelessness about the speed and demands of current conditions that could prevent things from improving.  Yet, on the positive 0e was the extraordinary committed engagement of the entire informant pool and the palpable wish to make things go better.</p>

<p>We can offer no magic wands for this scenario.  But as communication specialists focusing on the requirements of dialogue, we can propose that the traditional <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of communication serving the user studies research enterprise and, in fact, all social science research enterprises, are not doing the job that needs doing.</p>

<p>It is at this juncture that we turn to our second article, a commentary that focuses on research as communicating.  To project ahead to our bottom <span>line</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> we draw in our second essay on a body of work primarily from the fields of philosophy and communication that says we must find ways to re-establish the importance of some communicating <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>that used to be normative in the social sciences and have become marginalized in current research practice; and we must find ways to invent new communicating <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>so that that communication we do about and for our research is more fruitful. </p>

<p>In the stage 1 interviews, we could sense the two polar dialectics that confound human efforts to communicate.  One is the polarity between uniformity and diversity.  On the uniformity 0e, there is the <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on homogenization, on orienting towards correct and right answers and on achieving consensus and avoiding dissensus.   On the diversity 0e is the <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on hearing different <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>so often challenged as ending in the chaos of solipsistic individuality.</p>

<p>The second polarity is between humanistic <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to communication and instrumental <span>approaches</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  The former <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on building empathy and deeper listening; the latter on structuring communications so as to achieve explicit ends, either manipulative (as in propaganda and much advertising) or well-intended (as in public communication campaigns and some management leadership styles).</p>

<p>We will develop an argument in <a href="paper287.html">the Keynote Paper</a> which suggests that the choices <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>at the ends of these dialectical polarities do not address communication in communicative ways.  Rather, we propose that we need to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on how symbolic interpreting humans <span>move</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>between the individual sense-making and sense-unmaking necessary for collective effort; and how humans are capable of flexibly designing and employing their communication so that these serve different ends. </p><br />

this journal.  Other recent works in this <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>include: Dervin (<a href="#DEB99">1999</a>); Dervin  (<a href="#DEB01">2001</a>); Romanello <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#ROS03">2003</a>); and Schaefer &amp; Dervin (<a href="#SDJ03">2003</a>). In addition, Dervin &amp; Foreman-Wernet (<a href="#DFW03">2003</a>) compiled a series of earlier works focusing on dialogue as a <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>requisite of the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of effective:  democratic <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>campaigns, programmes to address literacy issues, Third World development,  information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>design and organizational-constitutency relationships.  Central to this effort has been a <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on conceptualizing communication as communicative,  as internal and external activities that humans pursue to make and unmake sense of their <span>worlds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and to both <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>with and <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>out of <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>with the collective structures in which they find themselves.  This view of communication mandates that we look at communication not as an outcome but rather as a series of activities or step-takings (conscious or unconscious, habitual or capricious, <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>or duplicated) that may have different outcomes. This formulation suggests thinking about communication as repertoires of internal and external behaviour. Theorists who have informed this position include, in particular:  Carter (<a href="#CRF74">1974</a>, <a href="#CRF03">2003</a>), Stephenson (<a href="#STW67">1967</a>) and Thayer (<a href="#THL87">1987</a>, <a href="#THL97">1997</a>).

<p><a name="Acknowledge2" id="Acknowledge2"></a>(2) One example of a <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>between the library and information science and communication literatures on information seeking and use in the context of health information seeking is in a paper commissioned by the US National Library of Medicine (Dervin, <a href="#DEB01">2001</a>),  An example of a <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of twelve theories of media uses/effects is in Dervin <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#DSS05">2005</a>).  Examples of authors who have <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to the <span>growing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>body of disconnected offerings in the social sciences include:  Carter (<a href="#CRF03">2003</a>) who has admonished for years that we need to stop doing research that 'piles up, but does not add up'. (Carter <a href="#CRF03">2003</a>: 360); McGuire (<a href="#MWJ99">1999</a>: 386) who called for senior scholars to stop adding more undigested pieces to the pile but rather to turn their <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to observation, syntheses and interpretation;  and Hj&oslash;rland (<a href="#HJB96">1996</a>: 52) who challenged that  'We must cease the 
overproduction of unrelated facts'.  </p>

<p><a name="Acknowledge3" id="Acknowledge3"></a>(3)  As usual, the academic literature is not a good indicator of trends.  The current <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>in the different fields on the concepts user(s) versus audience(s) supports the traditional divisions of <span>attention</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> We  did  a title <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>for two top-tier journals in each of the three fields for two time periods (1990-95 and 2000-05) looking for use of the terms user(s) or audience(s).  In the library and information science field (tapped with the <em>Journal of the American Society for Information and Technology</em> and  <em>Information Processing and Management</em>), 100% of 48 articles in the earlier time <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>used the terms user(s) as <span>opposed</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to audience(s) and 98% of 86 articles in the later <span>period</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  For the human-computer <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>field (tapped with <em>Human <span>Computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>Interaction</em> and <em>International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction</em>), the comparable <span>figures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>were 100% of 7 articles for the earlier period; 100% of 40 articles for the later <span>period</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  For the communication and media studies field (tapped with the <em>Journal of Communication</em> and <em>Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media</em>), the comparable <span>figures</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>were 10% of 30 articles in the earlier period; and 14% of 21 articles in the later.  For the communication and media studies field, it seems that <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on users and audiences has gone down but, in fact, what has happened is that an array of new journals in the field has diffused <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to users and audiences and the dust has not yet settled on the impact.  Two examples include:  <em>New Media &amp; Society</em> and <em>Journal of Mediated Communication</em>.   In general, however, communication and media studies field articles have overwhelming focused on audiences, the library and information science and human-computer <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>fields on users.   Where the implosion between these tidy divisions shows is in the trade press, in, for example, the special section in <em>The Nation</em>, <a href="#GRR06">2006</a> on the 'national entertainment state', which <span>documents</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>not only the increased control over all information, communication and media <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>by a few mega-multinationals but also the <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>blurring of  the previously separated functions of information versus entertainment.  At the same time the seeming freedoms which the exploding internet <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>means we see average citizens <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on functions as journalists , 'a journalism without journalists'  as Lemann (<a href="#LEN06">2006</a>: 44)  called it; or as their own librarians, what Bates (<a href="#BME06">2006a</a>: 29) termed the 'disintermediation of information'. </p>

<p><a name="Acknowledge4" id="Acknowledge4"></a>(4) Numerous authors have interrogated the fundamental concepts:  use, uses, users.  Especially helpful have been:  Capurro <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#CAR02">2002</a>); Frohmann (<a href="#FRB92">1992</a>);  Julien (<a href="#JUH99">1999</a>); Pettigrew <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#PKE01">2001</a>);  Savolainen (<a href="#SAR00">2000</a>); Talja (<a href="#TAS97">1997</a>); Vakkari (<a href="#VAP97">1997</a>); Wilson (<a href="#WIT94">1994</a>, <a href="#WIT00">2000</a>).  Also helpful has been this edited compilation:  Olaisen <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#OJMPE">1996</a>). </p>

<p><a name="Acknowledge5" id="Acknowledge5"></a>(5) This <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of inquiry has a robust tradition.   These chapters provide a helpful overview: Murdock &amp; Golding (<a href="#MUG95">1995</a>); Smythe (<a  href="#SMD95">1995</a>).</p>

<p><a name="Acknowledge6" id="Acknowledge6"></a>(6) Con0erations of the terms information and knowledge have been fodder for continuing debate in the library and information science field from its origins.  Some particularly useful recent writings:  Bates (<a href="#BMJ06">2006</a>, <a href="#BMJ05">2005</a>); Hj&oslash;rland (<a href="#HJB02">2002a</a>); Capurro <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#CAR02">2002</a>);  Olsson (<a href="#OLM99">1999</a>).  In the communication and media studies field the distinction between being informed and being entertained has been maintained with relative constancy in a genre of research usually labeled as "media uses and gratifications".  In this work, information or being informed is con0ered a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>function of media (usually conceptualized as channels) than escape, diversion, or entertainment.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>recent example is Song <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#SOI04">2004</a>).  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>seminal example: Blumler &amp; Katz (<a href="#BJG74">1974</a>).  Signs that this distinction is being eroded show, however, in a number of terrains.  Just as librarians worry about how to <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>an address of information authority, the media world is focusing more intently on such issues as 'the <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of fact'  (Strange &amp; Katz, <a href="#SJJ98">1998</a>).</p>

<p><a name="Acknowledge7" id="Acknowledge7"></a>(7) The literature support for these three premises is given in the notes above.  An important point is that from a communication <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>the world as it has been constructed and <span>divided</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>into pieces by our disciplinary boundaries and the <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>they support is not the world in which everyday actors make and unmake sense.  The structures created by collectivities (e.g.,  governments, cultures, systems) may be seen, depending on your theoretical <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> as tight or elusive boundaries within which humans experience the everyday.  Most extant <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to communication <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on one or the other end of this structure-agency polarity.  This point will be addressed in our second paper in this series.  </p>

<p><a name="Acknowledge8" id="Acknowledge8"></a>(8) Of the three fields that are the foci of this paper, two have had a traditional <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>relationship with users or audiences, library and information science and communication and media studies.  The impact of the exploding electronic confluence on these fields is awesomely visible.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>Google <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>completed October 8, 2006 using the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>'future of libraries' yielded 60,000 hits; 'future of newspapers', 100,000; 'future of media', 260,000.  Examples of articles from library and information science addressing issues relating to whether and how libraries and information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>can compete:  D'Elia <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#DEG02">2002</a>); Hj&oslash;rland (<a href="#HDB02">2002b</a>).  Examples from communication and media studies focusing on media systems:  Cohen (<a href="#CEL02">2002</a>); Webster (<a href="#WJG05">2005</a>).</p>

<p><a name="Acknowledge9" id="Acknowledge9"></a>(9) Examples of studies from other fields that have been hopping on the user study bandwagon:  <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> McDonald (<a href="#MDS04">2004</a>); medicine, Chapple <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#CHA02">2002</a>); nursing: Edward &amp; Staniszewska (<a href="#ECS00">2000</a>); art: Hsi (<a href="#HSI03">2003</a>); Marty 
(<a href="#MPF06">2006</a>).</p>

<p><a name="Acknowledge10" id="Acknowledge10"></a>(10) All three of our focal fields have had a long-time <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on applying research to practice, to designing and implementing <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and services as well as campaigns and <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>efforts aimed at users and audiences.  All three have also been traditionally embroiled in tensions that characterize the research-practice divide <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>along four polarities:  a) research versus practice; b) research versus design; c) <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>versus service; and d) theoretical research versus applied.  Examples of recent articles in library and information studies and communication and media studies attending to these issues include:  Booth (<a href="#BOA03">2003</a>); Bryant (<a href="#BRJ04">2004</a>).  Of particular relevance to this study is an article by <span>Smith</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#SML06">2006</a>) which proposes that the standard divide between positivism and interpretivism feeds theory-practice inconsistencies.  He proposes critical realism as a <span>resolution</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  In the earlier stages of our dialogue project, we have deliberately asked <span>interpreters</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>not to propose <span>solutions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>  The practice-research divide plagues all the applied social sciences: see, for example:  Hammersley (<a href="#HAM03">2003</a>); Small (<a href="#SSA05">2005</a>).  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>literature review is available in Dervin, <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#DCP03">2003</a>).  Our study reported here focuses on polarities a, b and d as listed above.  We did not explicitly ask informants about gaps between <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>and service needs although some frontline practitioners did <span>speak</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to this issue.  For most, however, the issue of the <span>utility</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to service was <span>foundational</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to their other attentions.</p>    

<p><a name="Acknowledge11" id="Acknowledge11"></a>(11) This, we submit, is the divide that social scientists and their applied fields have been least paying <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to but is <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>having the largest impact on our fates.  We provide documentation for this argument and discussion of the issues it <span>raises</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>in our second article.

<p><a name="Acknowledge13" id="Acknowledge13"></a>(13) See references listed in Note (1).  The Sense-Making approach to dialogue draws upon many <span>foundational</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>sources particularly as referenced in Dervin &amp; Foreman-Wernet (<a href="#DFW03">2003</a>).  Three that deserve special mention are:  1) The <span>Delphi</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>method, which has been used in research although was developed by the Rand Corporation as a <span>technique</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>aimed at building consensus in policy groups during the cold war (Turoff <a href="#TUM02">2002</a>). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span><span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>thrust of its application, in addition to utilizing the idea of rounds, was the bracketing of power relationships by mandating anonymity among participants.  This is an aspect Sense-Making has adopted for early dialogic rounds.  As normatively used <span>Delphi</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>focuses on building consensus and partitioning dissensus.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>later development by Tapio (<a href="#TAP02">2002</a>) focuses on <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>not a <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>consensus but diverse scenarios in an approach  he calls 'disaggregative policy <span>Delphi</span>' <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span> although the goal is still to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>all inconsistencies.  Because of studies  (e.g.,  Schaefer and Dervin <a href="#SDJ03">2003</a>) that show that an <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on achieving consensus and avoiding dissensus may inhibit communication processes necessary for effective <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>dialogue, the Sense-Making approach to dialogue deliberately attends to both convergences and divergences and does not demand homogeneity either between or within participants except as it emerges <span>naturally</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>from rounds of sense makings and unmakings.  2) Flanagan's (<a href="#FJC54">1954</a>) 'critical incident <span>technique</span>' <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>, the cutting edge for its time approach for anchoring interviews to the material situations of interviewees' lives.  In a Sense-Making dialogue this is implemented by asking participants to articulate the <span>connections</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>between their own views and opinions and how these relate to their material circumstances.  3) The Frierean theory of dialogue (Friere, <a href="#FRP70">1970</a>, <a href="#FRP83">1983</a>) as developed in his <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>to literacy training and Third World development with its <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on the role of talking in generating raised consciouness (or what Friere calls <em>conscientizing</em>) and participatory readiness.  In Sense-Making interviews, this is implemented primarily by asking informants not only to explain what they see but the bridges, gaps and inconsistencies in what they see and how these connect to their material conditions.</p>

<p><a name="Acknowledge16" id="Acknowledge16"></a>(16)  There are numerous debates and <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of the Glaser &amp; Straus (<a href="#GBG67">1967</a>) 'grounded theory' approach from its original statement most popularly known as the 'constant comparative method' to more recent debates (e.g., Strauss &amp; Corbin, <a href="#SAL90">1990</a>).   Since we did not intend to develop theory but rather a descriptive portrait of the discourse covergences and divergences most applicable to con0ering problems of communication, we applied the method of <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>comparison to our <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>of the expert interviews intersecting these readings with Sense-Making's <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:207px 69px 207px 69px;position:relative;">.</span>on gaps and gap-bridgings.

<br /><em>That's also why I'm not optimistic about the chances for the dialogue in today's world, because listening implies the readiness to change.

<em>There's not one way to roam, there are many ways to roam and that certainly applies to user studies.

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Plagiarism has become a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>issue in <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>worldwide with literature on the issue, particularly at the tertiary <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>level, now being prolific (e.g., <a href="#Marsden">Marsden <em>et al.</em> 2004</a>). While the problem is not confined to copying from the Internet, its significant contribution to the problem is particularly emphasised (e.g., <a href="#McCabe">McCabe 2004</a>). As far back as 1998, Todd (<a href="#Todd">1998</a>: 28) showed the extent to which the electronic <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>played a part in the problem of plagiarism at <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>school level.</p>

<p>As Carroll (<a href="#Carroll">2002</a>) has shown, in the past many studies of plagiarism have tended to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>on quantifying the extent of plagiarism, primarily at the tertiary level. For example, in a <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of cheating in the UK by Newstead, <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#Newstead">1996</a>), the 947 student responses showed that more <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>admitted to paraphrasing from a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>without acknowledging than to <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>copying (54% compared with 42%). Other surveys (e.g. <a href="#Bull">Bull and <span>Collins</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>2001</a>; <a href="#Culwin">Culwin <em>et al.</em> 2001</a>) have substantiated the claim that plagiarism is a significant problem at tertiary levels. Perceptions of plagiarism were <span>investigated</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>by Ashworth and Bannister (<a href="#Ashworth">1997</a>), <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>through nineteen tertiary student interviews that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>were very unclear as to <span>exactly</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>what constituted plagiarism and were concerned about <span>accidental</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>plagiarism. Stark <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#Stark">2005</a>) explored unintentional plagiarism through two <span>experimental</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>studies of undergraduate <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> in which they found that substantial <span>amounts</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of unconscious plagiarism existed, even when participants were <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>a financial incentive to not plagiarise.</p>

<p>There is little research at any educational level that has explored what influences <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to plagiarise or has examined plagiarism in the broader context of information use. With <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to the former, Cox <em>et al.</em>  (<a href="#Cox">2001</a>) found that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and staff in their <span>survey</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> identified <em>time management</em> and <em>needing help</em> as two of the <span>main</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>reasons for copying or paraphrasing without citing, both of which were seen as serious forms of cheating.  Carroll (<a href="#Carroll">2002</a>: 19) includes a <span>table</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of reasons tertiary <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>have given for plagiarising based the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of an electronic plagiarism detection project (<a href="#Chester">Chester 2001</a>).  They include <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of time, the need to succeed, the <span>difficulty</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of the task, and <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>intrinsic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>interest in the <span>topic</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>  Since there appears to be no research at the <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>level, understanding what influences <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> before they reach tertiary <span>education</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> deserves <span>attention</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Although a number of researchers have contributed research about information use by <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>(e.g., <a href="#Kuhlthau">Kuhlthau 1993</a>;  <a href="#Limberg">Limberg 1999</a>), they have not <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>con0ered the relationship to plagiarism. One exception to this is McGregor (<a href="#McG93">1993</a>) and McGregor and Streitenberger (<a href="#McGandSt98">1998</a>) who examined information use and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>processes of high <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>students in two <span>qualitative</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>studies. They noted an apparent relationship between <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> thinking and the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of process and product orientation of that thinking. Plagiarism was a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>strategy for using information by <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>who exhibited mainly a product orientation, ie, were principally concerned with the results of their work rather than the processes of making sense, seeking meaning, learning, thinking, or doing research. Students who were aware of the processes, on the other hand, tended to manipulate and <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>their information and not to use plagiarism as a strategy. Students who were primarily oriented towards product exhibited less complex thinking behaviours than did those who also focused on processes.</p>

<p>The earlier McGregor research thus identified a possible <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>influence on information use in relation to plagiarism. Con0ering that clarification was required, the present researchers set out to explore further this relationship between the orientation of <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>school <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> thinking and the way in which they used the information they located, including the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of plagiarism. They also wanted to <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>the other influences that might be significant.For example, what might be the effect of student <span>attitudes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> such as their level of engagement and interest in their topic? </p>

<p>Using a <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>school <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>from an Australian country high <span>school</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> the researchers began their exploration of influences on information use and plagiarism in a pilot project (<a href="#McGandWill05">McGregor and Williamson 2005</a>) <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to underpin an application for Australian Research Council funding (The Australian Research Council is the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>funding body for Australian universities). This study explored the level of engagement and the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of learning by the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>as well as the idea that a relationship exists between level of engagement and/or the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of learning and the level of plagiarism exhibited by <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> Interviews with <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>provided rich data for con0ering the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of influences on <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>for using information, including plagiarism. </p>

<p>When the researchers found that their ARC application had been successful, they thought it timely to develop an interim model of the influences on information use in relation to plagiarism before embarking on the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>research. They decided to base this on the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of the pilot study but also to attempt to point to the gaps in understanding as revealed by the pilot research experience.</p>

<p>From this point the paper describes the genesis of the model, <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>by a <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of the philosophical <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and method used for the pilot study, and then the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that have contributed to the interim model. The final <span>sections</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>provide a discussion of the model and a <span>conclusion</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h2>Genesis of the Model</h2>

<p>Recently there has been <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>discussion of the role of theory in research on human information behaviour. <i>Theories of Information Behavior: <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>Researcher's Guide</i> (<a href="#Fisher">Fisher, Erdelez & McKechnie 2005</a>), a book <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to document metatheories, theories, and models of information behaviour, indicates the commitment to conceptual research in the field. As the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to the book states: "<span>Conceptual</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>work is the greatest and most <span>constant</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>challenge for many researchers" (xix).</p>

<p>With <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to information use, related to plagiarism, some theory has already been developed. As a result of her research <span>findings</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> McGregor (<a href="#McG93">1993</a>, <a href="#McG95">1995</a>) developed theory about thinking during information use and incorporated this into a model. One of the elements in this model is the influence of the product/process orientation on the complexity of skill usage in <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>an information problem. The relationship to plagiarism, further explored in the pilot study (<a href="#McGandWill05">McGregor and Williamson 2005</a>), has been described above.</p>

<p>Given that the present researchers wanted to extend their thinking to explore a broad <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of influences on information use in relation to plagiarism, they looked for other models that might assist. For her doctoral study, which examined the information-seeking behaviour of older people in relation to everyday life information, Williamson (<a href="#William95">1995</a>) used and adapted ecological theory discovered in the human development field (<a href="#Bronfen">Bronfenbrenner 1977</a>). Later (<a href="#William98">1998</a>) she developed a model to present that theory graphically. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>key influence for her ecological <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>was <span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>Hummert, Nussbaum and Wiemann (<a href="#Hummert">1992</a>), who argued that research about people must be grounded in a view of nature as <i>personal existence</i>, meaning that human beings should not be conceptualised exclusively as either individual entities or socially constructed entities. Rather, they should be seen as self-creating, but within <span>contexts</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that involve various <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of biological and social circumstances and constraints (418-419).</p>

<p>In developing her ecological theory, Williamson (<a href="#William95">1995</a>,<a href="#William98">1998</a>) con0ered other potentially useful theories of information-seeking behaviour, drawing relevance from them as applicable. From Dervin came the <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>on the need to understand information needs and uses in particular situations (<a href="#DervinZ">Dervin <em>et al.</em>  1976</a>) and to bring the user into key <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#DervinN">Dervin and Nilan 1986</a>). Wilson (<a href="#Wilson81">1981</a>) also developed useful theory about the effect of context on the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>human needs (physiological, <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and affective) which he saw as affecting information-seeking behaviour (later updated and <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in Wilson (<a href="#Wilson00">2000</a>).</p>

<p>Based on an <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>body of her research from 1998, Williamson (<a href="#William05">2005</a>) broadened and modified her ecological model to study information-related behaviour beyond the everyday life area. Her view is similar to that of Bates (<a href="#Bates">2002</a>: 13) who postulated that the scientific, the <span>cognitive</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> and the socially constructed metatheories all have value and a possible continuing role. She has particularly used both social constructionist theory (<a href="#Berger">Berger and Luckman 1967</a>) and personal constructivist theory (<a href="#Kelly">Kelly 1963</a>) to capture both shared and individual meanings – the consensus and the dissonance – about information seeking and use. In her contribution to the 'theories' book (<a href="#Fisher">Fisher, Erdelez and McKechnie 2005</a>) the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>example was based on a project focussing on information for people with breast cancer, first reported at an earlier ISIC Conference (<a href="#WilliamandM02">Williamson and Manaszewicz 2002</a>).</p>

<p>The researchers decided that Williamson's (<a href="#William05">2005</a>) modified model provides a useful basis for the development of their interim model of influences on information use of <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>students in relation to plagiarism. The influences in question are contextual and the philosophical underpinnings of the pilot study research are constructivist. The research philosophy and method of the pilot study – from which the data for the interim model emerged - are described in the next section.</p>

<h2>Research philosophy and method</h2>

<p>As will be the case with the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>research <span>beginning</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in 2006, constructivist philosophy underpinned the pilot study, both in terms of <span>approaches</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to learning and to research about learning through information use. As described above, the constructivist approach is particularly appropriate for research where ecological theory, focusing on individual and social <span>contexts</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> will also be applied. The constructivist approach has also been <span>supported</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>by leading educators who posit that constructivist principles (i.e., that learners are active constructors of knowledge) should underpin <span>teaching</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning (see, e.g., <a href="#Bruner">Bruner 1973</a>; <a href="#Jona">Jonassen 1999</a>.) Because each student builds on different previous learning and experience, each student's learning is unique. In the research arena, the constructivist paradigm assumes a relativist <span>ontology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>(multiple realities), a subjectivist <span>epistemology</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>(investigator and respondent co-create understanding), and a naturalistic (in the natural world) set of methodological procedures (<a href="#Denzin">Denzin and Lincoln 2005</a>: 24). Constructivists believe that there is no single objective reality 'out there'; <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>there are multiple constructed realities about the <span>phenomenon</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>under study. </p>

<p>The pilot study was guided by constructivist <span>paradigms</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> both personal constructivist and social constructionist. The former is explained by a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>theorists</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>who have postulated that individual reality is determined by each <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>s <span>perceptions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of what is real, and the notion that the 'meanings' that each <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>makes may differ from those of others (<a href="#Kelly">Kelly 1963</a>; <a href="#Lincoln">Lincoln and <span>Guba</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>1985</a>; <a href="#Hammersley">Hammersley 1995</a>). <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>construct theory, which places <span>emphasis</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>on the ways people develop meanings together, emerges from philosophical <span>roots</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>similar to those of personal construct theory. Well-known proponents of social construct theory are <Berger and Luckmann (<a href="#Berger">1967</a>) who argue that meaning is developed through the <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and social processes <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>people, language and religion. As Schwandt  states: 'We do not construct our <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in isolation but against a backdrop of shared understandings, <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> language, and so forth'. (<a href="#Schwandt">Schwandt 2000</a>: 197)</p>

<p>The above philosophical <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>articulated into ethnographic method, often used by constructivists, enabling the researchers to understand <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> constructions regarding information use and plagiarism, as well as their skills in <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to avoid it. Ethnography is most closely linked with participant observation. For example, Saule  describes ethnographers as 'studying people in their everyday <span>contexts</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> (<a href="#Saule">Saule 2002</a>: 179)  and Minichiello <em>et al.</em>  describe participant observation as 'studying people by participating in social <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with them in order to <span>observe</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and understand them' (<a href="#Minich">Minichiello <em>et al.</em> 1990</a>:18). Modern ethnography or participant observation uses a <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of techniques such as interviewing, <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>groups, observation and questionnaires and 'also has the flexibility to emphasize some techniques over others, and to leave some techniques out altogether' (<a href="#Bow">Bow 2002</a>: 267).</p>

<h3>Research aims and questions</h3>

<p>The aims of the pilot research were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>To <span>investigate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>students' understanding of plagiarism and their ability to recognise it when it <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in the work of others. </li>
  <li>To examine the influences on their use of information, including the extent to which plagiarism <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in their own work.</li>
  <li>To continue to explore whether <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> level of engagement with their work and interest in their <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>are significant factors in whether or not <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>plagiarise, as indicated in earlier studies.</li>
  <li>To continue to explore whether <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>who plagiarise, compared with those who do not, <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>more on the product, e.g., their written assignment, rather than processes such as learning and making sense as also indicated in earlier studies).</li>
</ul></p>

<p>The research questions which operationalised these aims were:</p>

<ul>
  <li >What do <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>students know about appropriate information use?</li>
  <li>Do they understand plagiarism and are they able to recognise it when it occurs? </li>
  <li>Does their understanding match their information use behavior? </li>
  <li>Do <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>who do not plagiarise have a high level of engagement with, and interest in, their topic?</li>
  <li>Do <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>who plagiarise, compared with those who do not, <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>more on the product, e.g., their written assignment, rather than processes such as learning and making sense?</li>
  <li>What other influences on information use, including the extent of plagiarism, can be discerned?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sample and data collection</h3>

<p>The <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>consisted of seventeen <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> from a NSW country high <span>school</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> where the key university involved in the project is situated. The <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>needed to come from one class as the researchers wanted to follow the complete process of their information use for one assignment, starting with the <span>introduction</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of the assignment by the teacher. The class chosen was studying Year 11 Ancient <span>History</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and undertaking an assignment on archaeology. The researchers con0ered any <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>year level to be appropriate and the assignment, <span>involving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span><span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>use of information sources, was con0ered <span>suitable</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> All <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in the class who returned their student and parent 'informed consent' forms were included in the project.</p>

<p>Data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>took place from February to May, 2004, using the techniques of observation, research logs, one written question, interviews and document examination. The observation took place during each of the periods when the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>were working on the project. Researchers took the opportunity to <span>observe</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>the sources being used and ask <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>questions about what they were doing. Students recorded their progress in research logs <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>the project. At the end of the data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span><span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>when it was too <span>late</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in the <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>term to schedule further interviews, it was found that responses to a single question were needed to confirm an emerging assertion that <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>were not sure what it means to 'acknowledge sources'. Students were therefore asked to <span>respond</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to a written question about their understanding of that element. </p>

<p>In terms of the development of the model, the key <span>technique</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>is the <i>interviews</i>, although document examination (analysis of the<i> assignments</i>) is important in that it enabled the <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> ideas about information use plagiarism, as they emerged in the interviews, to be compared with their <span>actual</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>practice (including the extent to which they plagiarised) as revealed in their final assignments. Fifteen of the <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>were interviewed four times; the other two only three times because they left <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>before the field work was completed. Interviews also took place with the teacher and the teacher librarian. All seventeen assignments were available for analysis.</p>

<p><i>Interviews</i> were guided by schedules of questions, with follow up prompts, for each of four interviews with <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> as well as for the teacher and the teacher librarian. The student questions were based on the phases of Kuhlthau's Information Search Process (ISP) (<a href="#Kuhlthau">Kuhlthau 1993</a>). The first interview was introductory, principally to get to know the <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> to talk about the task (the 'definition' stage of Kuhlthau's ISP), the process of choosing their topics (the 'selection' stage), and their <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to the assignment and the process they envisaged in undertaking it. The second discussed their progress and again discussed the process as they saw it. Most <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>were in the 'collection' phase of the ISP at this point. The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>interview occurred when <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>had completed their assignments, focusing on what they <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>they had learned in terms of skills and in <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and using information. Here we probed for the relative importance to them of their mark (which they knew at this stage), the product and the extent of their learning. The fourth and final interview took place a month later, following analysis of student papers, and again focused on what had been learned, especially in relation to <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and learning new information. This interview <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to determine <span>students</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> understanding of plagiarism, bibliographies, and citing. Their ability to recognize plagiarism in the work of others was included at this stage.</p>

<h3>Data analysis</h3>

<p>Although the data analysis does not constitute a 'grounded theory', it was <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>by the 'constructivist grounded theory' approach of Charmaz (<a href="#Charmaz">2003</a>). Charmaz says that, unlike the original grounded theory (<a href="#Glaser">Glaser and Strauss 1967</a>), constructivist grounded theory is not 'objectivist'. It 'recognises that the viewer creates the data and ensuing analysis through <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>with the viewed' and therefore the data do not provide a window on an objective reality (<a href="#Charmaz">Charmaz 2003</a>: 273). Charmaz therefore recognises that researchers' <span>backgrounds</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>will influence their <span>interpretations</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of the data. They cannot avoid being <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>by 'disciplinary emphases' and 'perceptual proclivities' (<a href="#Charmaz">Charmaz 2003</a>: 259). This means that, although there is every effort made to be true to the views expressed by participants, there is acceptance that 'we shape the data <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and redirect our analysis as new issues emerge' (<a href="#Charmaz">Charmaz 2003</a>: 271).</p>

<p>There were five steps to the initial data analysis of the <i>interviews</i>: (1) Data were transcribed. (2) The two researchers read through the data, making notes about the tentative themes (with definitions) which <span>appeared</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>to be emerging. (3) Passages of data were labelled with categories (or codes) and linked to one of the themes so that identically labelled or categorised data could be retrieved as needed. Further themes (broader than categories) were identified and defined as necessary. As with themes, categories were given a short title and a definition if needed. Initially categories were sometimes broad and sub-divided to be more precise as the analysis progressed. (4) Categories were conceptually organised, meaning that thought was given to the similarities, differences and relationships among the categories.(5) Final themes were developed in preparation for the <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>up of the research <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> The themes and categories con0ered relevant to this paper are listed in <a href="#Table1">Table 1</a>.</p>

<p>For analysis of <i>assignments</i>, each assignment was converted to electronic format and submitted to a plagiarism detection site. Results from this analysis were <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>through use of the Google <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>engine to <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>for key phrases, resulting in locating Websites that the plagiarism detection site had not found, often because of student spelling errors or minor changes to wording. All books cited in the bibliographies were searched except for two that could not be located. The student papers were colour coded to show which words and phrases had been taken from which books and Websites. The amount of <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>copying, whether plagiarized or appropriately cited, was quantified.</p>

<h3>Choosing the categories and themes relevant to the model</h3>

<p>When the researchers decided to develop an interim model from the pilot study data, with the idea of exploring the concepts of the model further in their <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>study, they discussed the themes and categories that might be relevant, based on their familiarity with the data from the earlier <span>analyses</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> Having made an initial <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>they found that, co-incidentally, several of their categories fitted into three of the themes that had been identified as part of a definition of an <em>information ecology</em> by Nardi and O'Day (<a href="#Nardi">1999</a>). Although these authors were talking about an information ecology as a <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>such as a library, the elements of their ecological system&mdash;people, <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and technologies&mdash;encompassed many of the categories already identified for the interim model, therefore providing <span>confirmation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>for the <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> In the proposed model, the 'values' theme has been replaced with 'attitudes' and the 'technologies' theme has been changed to 'technology', given that the only technology relevant to our research is the Internet. The theme 'prior learning' has been <span>added</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> Data were again searched to confirm the suggested categories and to identify other relevant ones within the nominated themes. The outcome of this <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>appears in the next section where it will be discussed in relation to the model.</p>

<h2>A model for understanding influences on information use and plagiarism</h2>

<p>Having identified the themes and categories, a key step was to modify Williamson's (<a href="#William98">1998</a>) ecological model to provide a diagrammatic <span>representation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>suited to the <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of information use and plagiarism. <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>1 presents this diagrammatic model. Since there are several categories that fit within each of the themes (surrounding the outer circle), it is possible only to include the themes in the diagram</p>

<div align="center"><img src="p288fig1.jpg" width="484" height="458" alt="figure_1" /></div>
<center><br /><strong>Figure 1: <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>model for understanding influences on information use and plagiarism</strong></center>

<p>The user (in this case a secondary-school student) is the centre of the model. The influences that bear upon student information use, epecially the level of plagiarism, come into the five themes shown beyond the outer circle: people, <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>attitudes</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> technology and prior learning. The broad groups of information sources through which these influences are filtered, are indicated in the other concentric <span>circles</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>Each of the themes, and the categories that <span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>within them, is discussed below. Table 1 provides examples of student quotations gleaned during the interviews, demonstrating information use within the categories identified. The way in which some categories might be related to levels of plagiarism may not yet be obvious, but the model aims to be broad and inclusive rather than parsimonious. Previous analysis shows relationships between some of the categories, such as engagement with their topics and <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>toward processes, within the theme of "<span>attitudes</span>" <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> (<a href="#McGandWill05">McGregor and Williamson 2005</a>), but much is yet to be learned.</p>

<p>It was clear that <i>people</i> had an effect on the way in which <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>used information. People that were mentioned by <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>were teachers, teacher librarians, family members and peers. One student mentioned contacting an expert in the field, which led us to con0ering a category of 'others' to encompass possibilities that did not emerge from this group of participants. The quotations above show some ways in which <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>received help from these people</p>

<p>Students revealed a number of <i>practices</i> related to information use. The way they take (or do not take) notes may be related to their tendency to plagiarise, with some <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>highlighting on photocopied pages and others <span>writing</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in bullet-point form. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>number of <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>pointed out how their use of time affected their final product, with many <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>procrastinating and then rushing to meet a deadline. The effect of the place in which they worked (location), such as the library or their home, may have some bearing on how easy it is to plagiarise or the level of engagement.</p>

<p>In terms of use of <i>technology</i>, <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>suggested that copying and pasting was an easy thing to do. Some admitted to having done it themselves in the past, but claimed to be aware now that it was inappropriate. One student also suggested that wholesale downloading of information might be a strategy used by some people. </p>

<p>Student <i>attitudes</i> were revealed in many of their comments. Attitude towards processes such as making sense of information, towards learning about the topics themselves (engagement), towards the assignment itself (their motivation or <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of same) were apparent in many cases. The place of their feelings and emotions (affect) as they worked were also demonstrated. These areas <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>contain <span>con0erable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>overlap, as it may be hard to <span>distinguish</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>motivation from engagement, for example. The area of <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>is the one in which some analysis has already been published (<a href="#McGandWill05">McGregor and Williamson 2005</a>).</p>

<p>The <i>prior learning,</i> or <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of it, experienced by <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>may influence their tendency to plagiarise. What they already knew and did not know about <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and using information (information skills) was often revealed. Some <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>were aware of how to use quotations but others were not. All <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>seemed to have some understanding of what plagiarism is, but most were unable to recognise it. Some <span>believed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>they did not know enough about how they could fulfil the requirement to use their own words, while others clearly grasped the concept of synthesis, evidenced in the analysis of their papers. Great <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>in prior knowledge of the purpose of a bibliography emerged as did knowledge of their topics. Some <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>chose their <span>topic</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>because they had never heard of it while others selected based on already knowing something about it.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>The interim model already provokes further questions and reveals some gaps that may be filled by a deeper understanding that will come with the next stage of research. The terms selected for the five themes are not carved in stone and could change. For example, it could be argued that the categories included within the "<span>attitudes</span>" <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> theme are not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>attitudes. Is engagement an attitude or a state of being? While motivation can certainly be related to attitude, is it appropriate to call it an attitude? Is there a more inclusive <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>that could replace attitude? Are there other categories that are related to the 'attitudes' theme? Three examples of themes/categories from the literature that did not emerge in the interviews but might benefit from further examination are 'beliefs', 'values', and 'philosophical perspectives'. What do <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>believe about using other people's words? Do they value ownership of ideas? Where and how do <span>ethics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>enter the picture? </p>

<p>When con0ered historically, ownership of ideas is a relatively new concept (<a href="#Lackie">Lackie and D'Angelo-Long 2004</a>) and one that is not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>subscribed to by the current generation of <span>students</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> Popular culture may have an influence on their <span>attitudes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>towards giving credit for use of the work of others. For example, the concept of 'sampling' used by disc jockeys, in which bits of music are selected and reprocessed to create a new whole without credit to the original work, is one that invites application to written work. Some musicians who insert recognisable segments into their music have been required to credit the original <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and, on occasion, pay royalties, but the trend is one that creates new mind-sets regarding ownership of ideas in general (<a href="#Bowman">Bowman 2004</a>: 9-10). 'Popular culture' could be con0ered as another theme in the model, although it did not emerge from the pilot study data.</p>

<p>The theme of 'prior learning' contains a category 'download'. The idea of downloading information from the Internet was mentioned by one student, but no one alluded to the myriad of Websites that give away or sell pre-written papers, perhaps because at this stage these <span>students</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>were unaware of them. The potential of prior knowledge of these sites is one that the researchers will need to be conscious of in the upcoming research.</p>

<p>The "prior learning" theme contains a category "citing" for which there were no examples found in the interview transcripts. The category is included because student papers clearly exhibited a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>of prior learning regarding how to acknowledge and cite other people's ideas appropriately, especially when not quoting. This concept will be explored further in the upcoming study.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The benefits of simplicity in model building have already been demonstrated by Bates' (<a href="#Bates">2002</a>: 4) 'Modes of Information Seeking' model. Our interim model is simple and also flexible. The themes and categories can be expanded as our thinking and <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>data <span>suggest</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> Developing the model has already given the researchers new insights at a <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>stage when they are about to embark on a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>study, building on their pilot project. They believe that the ARC-funded project will benefit greatly as a result. Although the target group for the research is <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>school <span>students</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span> the model is applicable to any group of information users.</p>

<p>As Nardi and O'Day (<a href="#Nardi">1999</a>) said, 'an ecology is complex'. However, at this stage it does not seem that the information and plagiarism research can determine the relationship between <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and people and their <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>as Nardi and O'Day discussed. The first step is to try to understand as many as possible of the various influences on information use in relation to plagiarism at various levels. It is likely that still other categories and themes will emerge in the new project and through ongoing literature exploration. The researchers will be open to this <span>possibility</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:99px 33px 99px 33px;position:relative;">.</span>and expect to revise the interim model accordingly.</p>

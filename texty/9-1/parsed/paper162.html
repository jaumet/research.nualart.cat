<h2>Introduction</h2>

<blockquote><em>People in virtual communities use words on screens to exchange pleasantries 
and argue, engage in intellectual discourse, conduct commerce, exchange 
knowledge, share emotional support, make plans, brainstorm, gossip, feud, 
<span>fall</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in love, find friends and lose them, play games, flirt, create a little 
high <span>art</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and a lot of idle talk.</em>  (<a href="#Rheingold">Rheingold, 1993</a>, p. 3)</blockquote>

<p>It is now generally <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that people engaging in electronic exchanges are able to create communities&mdash;places with socially constituted norms, <span>values</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> and expectations.  Text serves as the lifeblood of these electronic places, conveying the ideas and feelings of participants that lead to the <span>growth</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and evolution of a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>or to its demise.  We propose an approach grounded in linguistic anthropology and hermeneutics to shed light on culture, as it is enacted in virtual communities.  As we examine a given <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> we gain understanding into how culture is created and evolves. </p> 

<p>In the course of <span>interaction</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> virtual communities are confronted with a series of challenges brought about not only by the subjects they <span>discuss</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> but also by limitations and complexities of the technology through which they 
must interact, as well as by the texts that they write, read, and <span>interpret</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  This project examines a specific <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> looking at it through its texts, with an eye toward understanding how the hermeneutic activities reflected in these texts&mdash;the <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>s own attempt to understand the process through which they interact lead to the success or <span>failure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of virtual communities.  We adopt an anthropological <span>perspective</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> yoked with a methodology based in hermeneutics, to illustrate <em>how language use both reflects and influences 
culture in a virtual community</em>.  We begin by describing how text reflects culture and then present a conceptual model based on this <span>perspective</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  Next, we describe a study and the methods used to analyse selected 
postings to a Usenet newsgroup.  Then we present our analysis.  We conclude with a discussion of our <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and methodological approach, and implications for <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>research.</p>

<h2>Theoretical and methodological foundation: text reflects culture</h2>

<p>In this section, we begin with a brief overview of the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>issues associated with virtual communities, <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by a <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of our approach for studying them.</p>
	
<h3>Virtual community</h3>

<p>Virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>has come to mean many different things, but often <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to interconnected groups of individuals who use one of a number of computer-mediated communication forums&mdash;including Usenet newsgroups, listservs, Web-based discussion groups, etc.&mdash;to share interests, activities, and goals.  When Rheingold brought the WELL to the <span>reading</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>public in 1993, the idea of having a 'daily life in cyberspace' (p. 38) was new to many in the audience. The WELL <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>one kind of virtual <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> built in a text-based <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> and, at least at first, primarily based in one geographic area (<a href="#Rheingold">Rheingold, 1993</a>). Over the decade since publication of <cite>The virtual community</cite>, various types of virtual 
communities have been studied, and various <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>have been&mdash;and continue to
be&mdash;proposed and debated, including:</p>

<ul><li>Communities with a geographic base, such as the 'wired' neighbourhood (<a href="#Hampton">Hampton and Wellman, 1999</a>);</li>

<li>Communities with geographically dispersed memberships and shared leisure interests, such as soap opera fans (<a href="#Baym">Baym, 1997</a>);</li>

<li>Communities with occasional face-to-face <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and highly focused purpose, such as online Master's <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>students (<a href="#Haythornthwaite">Haythornthwaite <em>et al.</em>, 2000</a>)<sup><a href="#note1">1</a></sup></li></ul> 

<p>The concept of virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>is consistent with the concept of a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of practice, in which members actively participate in <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and construct identities in relation to the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#Wenger">Wenger, 1998</a>).    <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>is comprised of members 'bound together for <span>mutual</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
service' (<a href="#Schultze">Schultze &amp; Orlikowski, 2001: 55</a>).  Members of virtual communities 
tend to provide advice and <span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to problems expressed by other members, even though they may be strangers to one another (<a href="#Constant">Constant <em>et al.</em>, 1996</a>).  In virtual communities of practice, information is shared not on a <em>quid pro quo</em> basis, but on the basis of generalized reciprocity (<a href="#Wasko">Wasko and Faraj, 2000</a>).</p>

<p>There have been other foci in looking at multi-person <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>on a large scale using <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>mediated communication. DeSanctis and Monge (<a href="#DeSanctis">1998</a>) <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that virtual organizations need research support the better to manage communications for individuals and groups. Monge and Contractor (<a href="#Monge">2000</a>) encourage <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>on the communication networks that emerge among individuals, 
groups, and organizations. Teams and groups can also interact online, creating focused, multi-party virtual collectives on a smaller scale (<a href="#McGrath">McGrath &amp; Hollingshead, 1994</a>; 
<a href="#Turoff">Turoff, <em>et al.</em>, 1999</a>).  Focusing <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>on the technology used for virtual <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> writers such as Preece (<a href="#Preece">2000</a>) and Kim (<a href="#Kim">2000</a>) have focused on the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>built to encourage members to participate. On the other end of the <span>spectrum</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> some research has explored the communicative role of individuals and the text they produce as the basis of their participation (<a href="#Herring">Herring, 1999</a>; <a href="#Walther">Walther, 1996</a>). <span>Quantitative</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>survey and social <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis have been joined by virtual ethnography (<a href="#Hine">Hine, 2000</a>) and cyber-archaeology (<a href="#JonesQ">Jones, 1997</a>) as further methods of studying <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>online.

interpretation, especially the process of coming to understand text' (<a href="#Boland">Boland, 1991</a>: 439) provides an ideal <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for analysing and understanding the activities and <span>significance</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of online places inhabited by communities of writers and readers of the shared texts that form the basis of their <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> The <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of interpretation are the means through which online places are able to create robust cultural environments.</p>

<p>One of the cornerstones of Paul Ricoeur's hermeneutic theory is the 'mode of &quot;as if&quot; (&quot;as if you were there&quot;),' (<a href="#Ricoeur">1976</a>: 35) a process through which the texts of certain genres restructure the contextual cues that form a fundamental part of spoken discourse.  By <span>extension</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> this 'mode of &quot;as if&quot;' creates a kind of virtual 'place' through the mediation of the text. Because they exist through the creation and reception of texts, virtual communities <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>directly upon this 'mode of &quot;as if&quot;'.  These communities are inhabited by participants who  converse textually with each other 'as if' they were <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>present within a specific place (<a href="#Burnett2">Burnett, 2002</a>).  Understanding text <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>uncovering <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and norms embedded in the surrounding <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>s language.  The objective of hermeneutics is to understand how participants understand their <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>or in other words, the development of an 'understanding of understanding' (<a href="#Geertz">Geertz, 1983</a>: 5). </p>

<p>Studies of communities of practice have suggested that 'narration,' 'collaboration,' and 'social construction' function together in important ways to disseminate knowledge and build group cohesion <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the formal structures of an organization (<a href="#Orr">Orr, 1990</a>).  Thus, the collective knowledge of a group&mdash;the particular body of information that gives it definition&mdash;cannot be separated from the social context in which it <span>occurs</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#Brown">Brown and Duguid, 1991</a>).  </p>

<p>Since understanding is <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>context dependent, we can glean guidance from philology.  Philology, or the 'text-centered study of language' (<a href="#Becker">Becker, 1979</a>: 212), focuses on <span>explaining</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the relationship between texts and the context in which they are written.  Rather than simply providing verbatim <span>translations</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of texts, careful philologists also provide <span>detailed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>annotations that help the reader <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the text 
(<a href="#Geertz">Geertz, 1983</a>).  This approach assumes that individuals bring cultural biases to their readings of text, which in turn, affect <span>interpretations</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  Detailed descriptions of context are necessary so that readers may ascribe meaning more accurately (<a href="#Becker">Becker, 1979</a>; <a href="#Geertz">Geertz, 1983</a>).  This philological <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for hermeneutic analysis has been dubbed <em>cultural hermeneutics</em> (<a href="#Geertz">Geertz, 1983</a>).</p>

<p>The conceptual model, developed by Dickey, <em>et al.</em> (<a href="#Dickey">2002</a>), and 
shown in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>1, represents a virtual <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  The innermost <span>ellipse</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>represents the process of communicating with text.  At its core is <em>inscription of action</em>, which <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to the recording of activity by virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>members.   Inscription results in the creation of text, which can then be interpreted by one or more other participants in the <span>environment</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  The <em>interpretation(s)</em> in turn may or may not result in additional inscriptions. </p>

<div align="center"><img src="p162fig1.gif" width="634" height="408" border="0" alt="<span>Conceptual</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>Model" /></div>

<p>The interpretation of text is dependent upon the context in which it is written.  In other words, accurately to  <span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>or ascribe meaning, we must situate the text within a multi-faceted context (<a href="#Geertz">Geertz, 1983</a>).  We understand this context by investigating the relations of the text to various contextual facets (<a href="#Becker">Becker, 1979</a>).  Four important contextual relations are:  <em>coherence</em> (the relation of textual <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to other textual <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in the text); <em>invention</em> (the relation of text to associated texts); 
<em>intention</em> (the relation of text to its creator or creators); and <em>reference</em> (the relation of text to non-literary events) (<a href="#Becker">Becker, 1979</a>; <a href="#Geertz">Geertz, 1983</a>). In addition to the interpreted meaning(s) of text, the shared understanding of social structures influences inscriptions.  <span>Social</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>structures and processes particularly relevant to virtual communities include <em>communication <span>practices</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> power structures,</em> and <em>norms and values</em>. While social structures shape inscriptions, the content and interpretation of them may also lead to changes in them over time (<a href="#Giddens">Giddens, 1984</a>).  </p>

<p>The outer ellipses in the model depict differences in understanding of a virtual <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>s culture.  Individual understandings may be unique, or may be congruent with the understandings of other individuals, subgroups 
of individuals, or everyone participating in the virtual <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>This paper reports on a study that applies these concepts to practice by analysing <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to a Usenet newsgroup devoted to firewall technology.  We begin by describing the methods used for the study, then turn to <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of four different <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>from this <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>over the course of six weeks during the summer of 2002, after which we provide some conclusions and directions for <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>research.  Our goal is to provide a rich understanding of the ways in which text creates and sustains culture in such environments.</p>

<p>We should note, in passing, that we do not address here the question of whether the norms and <span>values</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>articulated through the texts exchanged by participants in the virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>are salient for (or representative of) those participants in their day-to-day lives <em>out0e</em> of their textual <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>within the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  That is, we are observing the participants through what they write within the context of a specific online <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> not drawing conclusions about the relationship between that <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and their lives <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>it.  Our argument is not that there is no relationship between activities within the virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and the lives of participants in other <span>contexts</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> but, rather, that the enactment and <span>expression</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of norms, <span>values</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> and interests in the texts exchanged by
<span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>members can tell us a great <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>about the norms and interests <em>within</em> the <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the textually-mediated <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>itself.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>

<p>We conducted this study to apply our ideas to practice by analysing <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to a Usenet newsgroup, <em><strong>comp.security.firewalls</strong></em>.  Although it currently uses the infrastructure of the Internet as its <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>mechanism for distributing messages, Usenet preceded the Internet as a large-scale, many-to-many communications <span>medium</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> and it has, over time, developed its own norms and standards for <span>interactions</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  Newsgroup 
messages are distributed from server to server, where they are stored and made available to participants who must use special 'newsreader' <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to download, read, and create messages.  Thus, unlike listservs, which come <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to participants, newsgroups must be actively <span>sought</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>out; while listservs are 'pushed' to participants, newsgroups must be 'pulled' from the server.  Further, because server administrators <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>local control, determining not only which newsgroups to offer, but also <span>establishing</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>policies for how long messages are stored before they are deleted, the set of messages available at any given time may be radically different from 
server to server.  </p>

<p>The requirement that participants use special <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to participate in newsgroups further influences the perceived social terrain of Usenet, because different newsreaders provide radically different capabilities 
for organizing and accessing messages.<sup><a href="#note2">2</a></sup>  Some newsreaders, like <em>tin</em>, <em>tass</em>, and <em>nn</em>, are themselves server-based, and <span>require</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>users to type commands to read and write messages.  Others, including popular Web browsers like Netscape and <span>Microsoft</span>' <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>s Internet Explorer, are 'client' readers, which re0e on the participants' own computers and often function much like other browser components.  Participants can also, depending on their <span>software</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> customize their own view of newsgroups, sometimes making significant changes in which posts from a newsgroup they see.  For instance, a participant who does not wish to read the posts of another participant can create a 'killfile' which prevents all of that participant's posts from being displayed by the newsreader without impacting the blocked participant's ability to post or the ability of others to read the blocked posts.  Users can also pick and choose which messages they read, opting to <span>limit</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>their view of a newsgroup to either posts written by a select group of participants or posts on a select set of topics.</p>

<p>Thus, individual participants may have very different views of the current  <span>status</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of any newsgroup at any given time simply because of differences in  server policy and newsreader <span>characteristics</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  Given such variability in what 
 individuals see of a newsgroup, it is <span>impossible</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to claim that there are clear boundaries to any given newsgroup or that there is a single 'correct' version of a newsgroup.  Rather, the content of a newsgroup is, in part, determined for any given participant at any given time by the set of constraints imposed by the server and newsreader <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and the choices of the participant.  </p> 

<p>The current study uses a series of different 'slices' of newsgroup activity to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the variability of possible views of a Usenet newsgroup.  All messages from the newsgroup appearing on the news server at a <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>university in the south-eastern United States during a six-week <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in the summer of 2002 were downloaded and archived.  From this full archive of nearly 2000 posts by several hundred participants, the following <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>were extracted and used for analysis:</p>

<ul><li>Fifty consecutive posts from one randomly selected <span>day</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span></li>
<li>All posts from the five most active threads.</li>
<li>All posts from the five most active participants.</li>
<li>All posts from a randomly selected set of five short threads.</li></ul>

<p>Each of these groupings of posts was printed and examined using the <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>described in the conceptual model.  The objective of this study is to <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the basic concepts of the model and to examine the extent to which this analysis sheds light on culture in virtual communities.  While each of these <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>is <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and, in some regards, problematic (such deficiencies will be discussed below), the use of multiple <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the data for analysis, because it reflects differences in the ways in which <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>participants view the newsgroup, allows a better understanding of the context of exchanges, and a richer <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the norms and communication <span>practices</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that characterized the newsgroup.  Each <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>was analysed by at least two of the four authors and coded to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the four contextual relations (coherence, <span>reference</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>invention</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> and intention) described in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>1.  These concepts were operationalized as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Coherence</strong>, or the 'relations of textual <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to each other within the text' (<a href="#Becker">Becker, 1979</a>: 212), describes the set of constraints or rules that govern the creation of texts, enabling readers to make sense of them.  <span>Elements</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of coherence include both the formal norms of grammar and the informal norms of social and textual practice.  Posts were analysed in terms of the rules of 'correct' grammar to <span>establish</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to which such formal rules were pertinent within the newsgroup.  Further, posts were examined to determine the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to which the norms of social and textual practice were pertinent; 
particular <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>was paid to the inclusion and ordering of textual elements within posts, including signature files, self-referential comments, technical or other acronyms and abbreviations, and technical jargon.</li>

<li><strong>Reference</strong>, or the relation 'of textual <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to nonliterary events' (<a href="#Becker">Becker, 1979</a>: 212), describes the ways in which events and objects in the world enter into the discourse of the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  Because the newsgroup being examined for the current study focused on <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>security issues, it was assumed that <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to things such as firewall <span>software</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> security breaches, processes and <span>tools</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for controlling security, etc., would be a strong element of all (or almost all) posts.  Posts were also analysed for evidence that such references were shared  and <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by the group, as well as for examples of non-technical 
 references (such as references to political events) within posts.</li>

<li><strong>Invention</strong>, or the relation 'of textual <span>units</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to other texts' (<a href="#Becker">Becker, 1979</a>: 212), is a measure of the social readability of texts in relation to the rules and body of knowledge <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by earlier texts.  Posts were examined to determine whether they <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to or <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>quoted previous posts, as well as the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to which they made <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to printed materials such as technical manuals and documentation.  Particular <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>was paid to the ways in which such use of prior texts was linked to 'speaking the past' through <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to existing texts or, conversely, reflected an effort to 'speak the present' through the creation of new knowledge or through criticisms of existing texts.</li>

<li><strong>Intention</strong>, or the 'relations of the creator to the content of the text, the <span>medium</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> and to the hearers or readers' (<a href="#Becker">Becker, 1979</a>: 212), describes the purpose for which a text is created.  However, a writer's intention is, in the strictest sense, an internal <span>psychological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>phenomenon which is not accessible to analysis; because textual meaning, in a virtual <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> is negotiated through the <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of interpretation and hermeneutic practice, intention is more usefully operationalized as something which is recreated socially through the <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of participants in a discussion.  Thus, posts were examined for overt <span>statements</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of intention, 
as well as for situations in which the intentions of a writer became an issue in <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>posts. </li> </ul>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
	
<p>For each of the four <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of textual communication, we begin with an overview of the <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>followed</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by our analysis in terms of coherence, <span>reference</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>invention</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> and intention.  We conclude with an overall <span>characterization</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>s culture, as <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by that <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> along with limitations of the <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h3>Sample one: fifty consecutive posts</h3>

<h4>Sample overview</h4> 

<p>This <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>provides, perhaps, the most 'natural' view of the newsgroup, since it simply extracts every message present on the news server during a specific <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of time, without giving preference to individual posters or threads.  Since most newsreaders offer the capability of sorting messages by a variety of criteria, including 
sender and subject, the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>is not the only possible view of the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  It does, however, provide a good illustration of the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of posts and participants to be found there.  During the 20 hours <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by this <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> 40 <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>individuals posted messages on 32 different topics (including one example of sexually-oriented spam).  Only two posters in this <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>were among the five most prolific posters to the group.  The activity <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by this <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>can be con0ered to be very nearly independent of that found in our other <span>samples</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> although it is linked to the others by the overall subject <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the newsgroup and by the social and textual norms it contains.</p>

<h4>Coherence</h4>

 <p>Coherence describes the set of socially <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>textual constraints and norms to be found within a specific group, and specifies the standard 'look and feel' of the texts exchanged by that group.  In a Usenet newsgroup, elements of coherence will include the presence or absence of signature files (or 'sigs'), the level of technical or other jargon in the posts, the <span>choice</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of an individual poster to use their real name and e-mail address or not, as well as norms of grammar and usage. </p> 

<p>Given Usenet's long history, many of these elements of coherence are generic to Usenet as a whole, while others are specific to given groups.  Many newsgroups make such norms explicit through the creation of Frequently Asked Questions files (FAQs), which are posted on a <span>regular</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>basis to the group and made available on the World Wide Web (<a href="#Burnett3">Burnett &amp; Bonnici, 2003</a>).  However, the newsgroup under observation, like others devoted to <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>security, does not <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>a FAQ to articulate social or textual norms, preferring to use the FAQ to address technical aspects of firewalls only.  Thus, an unstated norm of coherence in this newsgroup is that posts are <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>limit</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves to such technical issues, omitting any other information.  Perhaps as a 
result, while certain elements of coherence were consistent <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the fifty posts, others were quite variable.  </p>

<p>In general, posts in this <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>reflected this norm, <span>containing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>some <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of technical jargon, and there is an overall sense that all readers of the group would understand such jargon, since they all share a common interest in the technical aspects of firewalls.  One short thread within the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>made joking <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to the necessity for such jargon in a technical <span>setting</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> with one poster mentioning the 'arcane settings' required by a particular piece of 
firewall <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and another responding that whether or not the settings were 'arcane' depended upon the knowledge of the user.  Indeed, many of the posts in the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>were <span>free</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>enough in their use of technical jargon that non-technically oriented readers would find the posts quite difficult to follow. </p> 

<p>Over time, Usenet has become notorious as a <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for e-mail addresses used by spammers to send out unsolicited messages to large numbers of people.  Given that the newsgroup is focused on issues related to 
<span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>security and firewalls, it might be <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that participants would demonstrate a strong tendency to protect themselves from receiving spam by altering or falsifying the e-mail addresses they attach to their messages; it might also be <span>expected</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that participants would use pseudonyms rather than real <span>names</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  However, only ten posters in this <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>used <span>false</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>or modified e-mail addresses; similarly, only fourteen used pseudonyms to mask their identities.  Of the 22 posters who used signature files to identify themselves, only two used files that overtly addressed security <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by including anti-spam and encryption information.</p>

<p>Norms of grammar, usage, and message structure tended towards informality, often relying on truncated <span>sentence</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>fragments, although several posters mimicked the formal structure of letters in their posts, including full salutations and closings.  The tone of posts, overall, was conversational, even in the most highly technical messages.  For example, in <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to a request to post firewall logs to the group, one <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>responds:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>I'd rather not. I rack up a 1MB file log file each <span>day</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>just off my 
Linksys alone, and my home server logs contains a little too much 
personal site info to post here.</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4>Reference</h4>

 <p>Reference, through which external non-textual 
events or objects enter the texts of a group, is the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
way in which groups define and control their terrain of subjects 
and interests.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>group remains 'on-task' to the extent their posts 
<span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>a shared set of external references rather than indulging in 
'topic drift'.  The newsgroup, with its sharp <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>on the nuts and 
bolts of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>firewalls, relied consistently on the materials 
and procedures of firewall technologies, referring to such things 
as the installation and maintenance of <span>hardware</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> the benefits and 
drawbacks of specific <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>packages, and the use and interpretation 
of log files.  The only post of the fifty that utilized references 
not related to firewalls was the single instance of spam in the <span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  
Thus, this <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>suggests that the group preserves a strong, shared 
<span>universe</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of references and has little time or interest, at least 
in the newsgroup itself, for other issues.<sup><a href="#note3">3</a></sup></p>

<h4>Invention</h4>

  <p>Individual threads provide perhaps the best <span>mechanism</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for analysing <span>invention</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> because of the ways in which 
they often begin through the posting of a query or the <span>description</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of a problem, and conclude with an example of 'speaking the present' through the posting of an answer or a solution.  Because this <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of fifty consecutive posts includes only <span>partial</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>threads, instances of <span>invention</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>were less clearly defined here than in our other <span>samples</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  
However, twenty-two of the fifty posts made explicit <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to external documentation and other information sources, thus answering questions by 'speaking the past' <span>contained</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in existing texts. </p> 

<p>Posts in this <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>also provided several interesting examples of the relationship between information emerging from the expertise of the participants and information already documented in existing sources.  Several posts made explicit <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to the need of the group to invent new knowledge because of the <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of or the poor <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of existing documentation; for example, one poster noted that 'Microsoft has really no documentation or TID's on which ports OWA 2000 needs to use ....'  Most interestingly, two posters explicitly commented on the value of creating new information via the texts created by newsgroup participants, including one who closed a post by writing:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>please keep me informed of your <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  
(please, send me a copy by e-mail as well !)</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in which existing information resources&mdash;those that 'speak the past'&mdash;are lacking, the <span>invention</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of new knowledge is of particular importance, and newsgroup participants appear to be acutely aware of the value of that aspect of their <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h4>Intention</h4>

<p>Perhaps because of their consistently strong <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>on the subject area of the newsgroup, participants in essence 
<span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>a single over-arching intention for all of their posts in this sample: to share information related to the implementation, management, and configuration of firewall technologies.  </p>

<p>Within this <span>framework</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> individual posts, of course, reflected other more specific intentions.  These include searching for information, attempting to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>a problem, providing bibliographic references, providing trouble-shooting assistance, and criticizing existing documentation or firewall technologies.  Most posts did not make 
these intentions overt, since they are all part of the governing intention of the group.  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>handful of posters, however, made <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to their intentions through phrases such as 'I am now seeking information here,' or 'I hope this helps anybody who finds themselves trying to trouble shoot ....'   Such a paucity of <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>markers of intention may be the result of the strength of the shared intention of the group as a whole.  That is, when all participants are in agreement about their goals, they do not feel the need to state them <span>directly</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> but can simply <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that their intentions will be <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>understood</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by others within the group.</p>

<h4>Overall <span>characterization</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the community</h4>

<p>As viewed through the lens of a randomly selected <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of fifty consecutive posts, the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>found in the newsgroup appears to be quite atypical of those found in Usenet generally.  In the place of seemingly endless 
flame wars and large numbers of spamming messages, this <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>reveals a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>keenly focused on its area of interest.  In addition, while some posters are slightly more active than others within the <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> the work of the group&mdash;on-going troubleshooting and sharing of information&mdash;is evenly spread among a number of 
people who share a set of <span>concerns</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>while treating each other with respect and con0eration.  In this <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> very little time is spent off-task or on issues peripherally related to firewalls.  Rather, every post (with the exception of the single instance of spam) is aimed both at furthering the goals of the group as a whole by amassing a body of information on firewalls and in assisting individual participants in their efforts to understand, implement, and <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>firewall technologies effectively.  Seen through this <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> in fact, the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>appears to undertake its work with a bare minimum of fuss or <span>conflict</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h4>Limitation of the Sample </h4> 

<p>In terms of providing an <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>representation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the newsgroup's <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> this randomly 
chosen <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of fifty consecutive posts has two <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>limitations, especially when viewed in <span>comparison</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>with the other <span>samples</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<p>First, as is the case with any narrow slice of a large, on-going 
<span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> this <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>is <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by its arbitrariness.  Because 
it both begins and ends <em>in medias res</em>, the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
omits both a number of queries that are answered within the 
<span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and, more importantly, a number of replies to queries 
that appear within it.  Thus, the view of the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>provided 
by the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>may be misleading; it is very possible, for example, 
that one or more of the threads that begin within the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>may 
have erupted into flame wars in posts following the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>itself, 
an eventuality that the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>itself could never reveal.  Because 
of this, the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>may miss some of the elements of social 
<span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that are common within the group, but (for whatever reason) 
did not <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>during the very brief <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of time <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by the 
<span>sample</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  It seems likely, then, that the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>cannot be <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
generalized as representative of the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>over time.</p>

<p>Second, the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>misses both the <span>extended</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>interactions of the most active threads and the active participation of the most frequent posters.  Thus, it clearly misrepresents the level of commitment of the active posters, and may misleadingly present infrequent participants as if they were more <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>than they in fact may be.  Indeed, a cursory look at the full six weeks of posts gathered for this project reveals that some posters who appear to be core members of the <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> posted rarely <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of this <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>or (more commonly), even if they did post regularly, could hardly be characterized as active participants.  The <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of fifty consecutive posts provides no way of assessing such situations.</p>

<h3>Sample two:  five active threads</h3>
 
<h4>Sample overview</h4>

<p>This <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>gathers the five threads with the greatest number of postings found during the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in which the data were collected.  While we <span>discuss</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>only one of those threads in detail, <span>analyses</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the other threads revealed 
similar characterizations.  </p>

<p>The thread included thirty-four postings from a total of twelve individuals, who include Europeans (probably British and French) and Americans; more than likely, all participants were male.  References in the text <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that the ages of participants may be widespread.  </p>

<p>The poster who started the thread asks for a firewall solution to consistent attacks on a Web server, both from hackers and viruses.  Five posters <span>offered</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>help, but the bulk of the messages comprised a flame war between two posters who are self-proclaimed firewall experts.  Another poster <span>offers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>solutions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>at times, but also negotiates expertise with some of the other posters.</p>  

<h4>Coherence</h4>

<p>Throughout the thread, posters snip entire texts from previous messages as a way to provide coherence.  The <span>extensive</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>use of snippets reflects the way in which Usenet messages are received, often not in chronological order, and sometimes twice.  In several instances, however, they also snip <span>partial</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>message texts, either to fuel a flame war and/or to inject humor, as in this example text, which attacks the first poster's expertise by insinuating that he works in a fast food restaurant rather than in <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>security:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre> I got to go to work. Have fun flipping the burgers.</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In this <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> grammar rules were consistent with the other <span>samples</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  Fifty percent of the posters were blatantly anonymous, about a <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>used an e-mail address <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to protect them from spam, and over fifty percent used some type of signature file.  Several postings refer <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to communication norms, as in one example that reminds others to avoid cross-posting to other newsgroups:  'Try not posting to every group under the sun.' </p>

<h4>Reference</h4>

<p>Out0e references allow us to characterize the 
nature of work for firewall experts.  From references made 
in the postings, we learn which <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>is being used to 
prevent and <span>detect</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>intrusion, and which alternatives are 
favored or disdained in the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  We learn about 
viruses that <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>these experts, e.g., CodeRed.  From 
the <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> we can construct a <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of companies and 
resources that can inform us about firewalls and security.  
In this particular thread, we learn that there is dissension 
in the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>about whether BlackIce is a firewall at all, 
and whether it is appropriate for commercial use.  We learn 
that a GRC Leaktest is something that firewall experts do.  
We learn that most firewall experts who <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves 
to be gurus run command <span>line</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>interfaces, not graphical 
user interfaces, on their Web servers:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>but then again I couldn't see why one would want to run a GUI 
on a server (most of the time I might add) at all. ;)</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4>Invention</h4>

<p>The format of the thread lends itself well to an analysis of <span>invention</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in the text.  In the thread, a query was 
posted, including technical elements of a current problem, which illustrates 'speaking from the past'.  The 
responses 'speak the present' by offering new <span>solutions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  The <span>rest</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the postings negotiate the new <span>solutions</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> 'speaking the past' by referencing previous texts, but also 'speaking the present' by offering alternative perspectives. </p>

<h4>Intention</h4>

<p>The content of the messages reveals several intentions.  The initiator of the thread had the intention of asking a question.  Several posters <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to answer the query, as in this text: </p>

<blockquote>
<pre>There are two alternatives I can think of:

Get all the current patches from MS and apply them.  Hope 
that there are no new <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>security holes waiting to 
be exploited.  Given IIS's security record you will 
most likely be unlucky.

Get Apache for Windows and run it <span>instead</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  It has a much 
better security track record than IIS.  Obviously, problems 
will <span>arise</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>so, again, make sure you stay up to date 
with any security fixes.</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Other posters <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to demonstrate their own expertise 
about firewalls and security, and discredit the expertise 
of others.   This intention was illustrated predominantly 
in the flame war that ensued, but also in attempts to diffuse 
flaming.  During this flame war, several posters make 
explicit knowledge claims, while others refute those claims.  
When the knowledge claims differed, then attacks on reputation 
(or expertise) began as the following post illustrates:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>Just what is it that you do for a living.  Are you in the IT field doing 
<span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>security, operations, pc tech, <span>programming</span>, <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> operations, systems?  
Or is it none of the above?</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This poster indicates that he does not respect the other's 
expertise, and with his laundry <span>list</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of IT <span>positions</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> tries 
to demonstrate his own expertise at the same time.</p>

<p>Such <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>suggests a strong newsgroup norm that does 
not tolerate <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of expertise.  Ignorance about firewalls 
and security is taken as ignorance in general, and any 
demonstration of <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge results in attacks on 
the poster.  The threads with the greatest number of postings 
portray a very hostile <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in which to build a knowledge 
base, inaccessible to newbies.   </p>

<h4>Overall <span>characterization</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the community</h4>

<p>Our analysis of the five longest running threads during the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>revealed two related <span>characteristics</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  First, knowledge creation, the ostensible work of the <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> happens on the edges of the discussion.  Second, frequent posters negotiate their reputations as firewall or security experts.  In several instances, posters would post a single message offering a solution to the query, and then drop out of the thread, choosing not to participate in the flame wars that ensued.  One poster, for example, snips heavily from the original message and intersperses his on-task <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in this single message:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>[original poster's text about being hacked and having viruses]

Probably CodeRed or Nimda.

[What can I do about prevention?]

Do the first thing an admin should do: keep your <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>up 
to date! Patch your 2k box !</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>This poster does not reappear in the thread.</p>

<p>In contrast, frequent posters spend their time negotiating 
reputations, not offering any real <span>solutions</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> as earlier 
quotes from the thread <span>suggest</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  The postings are not 
substantive in terms of knowledge creation.  So at least 
in the longest running threads, we have to sift through a 
great <span>deal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of 'I know more than you know' to find out something 
that someone might <span>actually</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>know.</p>

<h4>Limitation of the Sample</h4>

<p>As this analysis suggests, the longest 
threads do not <span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>reflect the true work that takes place 
within the newsgroup, but rather emphasize the negotiation of 
reputations that take place by flaming and social sniping.  
Indeed, looking at long running threads reveals a limitation 
of the conceptual model.  Communication frequency did not 
<span>necessarily</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>correlate with the amount or <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of work 
being accomplished.  Our model does not explicitly capture the 
importance (or unimportance) of communication frequency.</p>

<h3>Sample three:  five prolific posters</h3>

<h4>Sample overview</h4>

<p>In this section, we provide short profiles of 
each of the five most prolific posters.  During the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
studied, these five individuals contributed 400 <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
posts to the group.  Each of these individuals has a unique 
profile, with differentiating <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>ranging from 
their use of signature files and emoticons to their areas 
of expertise.  All appear to be male, although that cannot 
be determined with certainty.</p>

<h4>Poster characteristics</h4>

<p>During the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of study, the 
first prolific poster made 154 posts to the newsgroup.  
He uses no signature file, uses a pseudonym for all of 
his posts, and has modified his e-mail address to combat 
spam.  The second prolific poster, who uses his full name 
for posts, uses his correct e-mail address, and has no 
signature file, made 94 posts.  The <span>third</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>poster made 
65 posts during the <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of study, using his first name 
only, and providing his correct e-mail address and no signature 
file; unlike the other active posters, he never uses salutations 
or closings of any <span>sort</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in his posts.  The fourth poster, who also 
uses his name and correct e-mail address, consistently uses a 
signature file (quoting a popular song) in his 55 posts.  The 
final active poster also uses a signature file <span>throughout</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>his 
32 posts, in which he modifies his e-mail address in an explicit 
effort to combat spam; he also, alone among these five, has an 
e-mail address which uses his own <span>domain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>name.</p>

<h4>Coherence</h4>

<p>During exchanges that <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>on firewall technology,
each of the five posters maintains a consistent approach to 
structuring messages, snipping short segments from previous 
posts to provide a context for their answers, or, for more 
complex questions, interpolating answers into the middle of 
longer quotes.  However, this pattern breaks down when 
something goes 'wrong' in a thread, whether because a post 
betrays <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of knowledge or expertise or because a post 
challenges the expertise of the prolific poster.  In these 
cases, each of the five will avoid answering the content of 
the previous post, and address the perceived ignorance or threat.</p>  

<p>In addition, each of these prolific posters includes small, 
personalized touches within their posts which, though they 
may not closely follow the newsgroup's norms for message coherence, 
serve to identify them as individuals.  For instance, one of the 
five uses emoticons in his posts, something that is rare elsewhere 
in the group.  Similarly, this poster, like one other, includes 
an automated preface to anything he quotes from other participants:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>"Taking a moment to <span>reflect</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> [poster's name here] wrote:"</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4>Reference</h4>

<p>Interestingly, there does not seem to be a 
correlation between the sheer number of posts made by an 
individual and the breadth of <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>knowledge generated 
by that individual.  Indeed, the most active of the five 
posters responds only to posts that refer to the firewall 
product ZoneAlarm in their subject <span>lines</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> while another <span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
to post in a variety of threads (often multiple times) only 
to denigrate other <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>members and, even, firewall 
technology in general, as in one post in which he writes, simply:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>Personal firewalls are unnecessary crap.</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Only two of the five most prolific posters post on a wide 
<span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of firewall topics, although one of them posts much more 
<span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>when the discussion involves a particular product.</p>

<p>One of the posters writes straightforward answers to even 
the most naive of questions on a variety of firewall topics, 
and occasionally acts as peacekeeper. For example, in one 
exchange, he keeps the group on-task by responding to a flaming 
dismissal of a firewall as 'braindead' by writing:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>I disagree. It can make sense to use both. They might 
already have a <span>central</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>firewall, the poster didn't say.</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>While the previous post used <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>as an excuse for argument, 
this <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>returns the group to a <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>on issues related to 
firewalls, thus maintaining shared <span>reference</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>as a tool for <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>building. </p>

<h4>Invention</h4>

<p>Posts of the prolific posters are highly self-contained, 
and display little explicit relationship to associated texts; 
rather, they tend to draw upon their own firewall expertise to 
answer questions.  If one of the five posts more than once in 
a particular thread, he will on occasion refer to his own posts.  
In one case, one of the prolific posters <span>refers</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>a newer member 
of the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to a different thread, which presumably contains 
relevant information.  Also, as noted above, the five prolific 
posters tend to draw upon their own personal experiences with 
specific firewall technologies; thus, they tend to 'speak the 
past' of their own existing knowledge. The information they 
provide to others, however, may 'speak the present' for the 
group as a whole, adding to the collective body of knowledge 
in ways that are otherwise unlikely.  </p>

<h4>Intention</h4>

<p>The prolific posters' posts <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>several 
intents in their postings.  Mostly, they provide help, 
assert their knowledge, <span>maintain</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>their reputations, flame 
others, or attempt to keep the peace.  Of some interest is 
that their pay-off for doing so is not apparent in the text. 
That is, it is apparent from the texts that they are 
protective of their knowledge, expertise, and reputations, 
but it is not clear how they personally benefit from that 
protection other than maintaining a high profile within the newsgroup.   </p>

<h4>Overall <span>characterization</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the community</h4>

<p>Prolific posters do not contribute heavily to on-going threads, 
but rather tend to post only once or twice within a thread. 
The five most prolific posters in this <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>rarely 
interact <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>with one another. Instead, they answer 
questions posted by less frequent posters, offering advice 
and help and at the same time working to keep their own 
presence and expertise in others' awareness. </p>

<p>The most prolific posters almost never start threads or ask 
questions. One of the five begins two new threads within this 
sample; the other four start none. When these prolific posters, 
who all <span>con0er</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>themselves experts in some aspect of <span>computer</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
firewall technology, do ask questions, it is generally not to 
gain information that they can use <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>list</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> Instead, 
they ask questions for two reasons: first, to clarify someone 
else's information need; or second, to denigrate someone else's 
knowledge, as in the following example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>I have been in the IT field since 1971 from the mainframes to 
the client server platforms. I have forgotten more about 
things in this industry then [sic] you will ever possibly know. </pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The five prolific posters, on rare occasion, do exert 
their power (or their perceived power), acting as 
arbiters of Usenet or newsgroup, for example reminding other 
posters to avoid using <span>HTML</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in their posts or recommending 
more effective subject <span>lines</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> as in the following example:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>Maybe you need to repost with a different subject like 'ZA 
and <span>FTP</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>issues.' You should be able to find some good ZA people here.</pre>
</blockquote>

<h4>Limitations of the sample</h4>

<p>This slice of the data analysis leaves us with no good way to examine or understand how these five prolific posters contribute to each thread or to the culture of the newsgroup as a whole.  With the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>on individuals rather than on group-wide <span>interactions</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> our view of knowledge creation lacks context, in part because we are unable to see how the texts produced by the five prolific posters are taken up or interpreted by others.  Rather, this <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>only allows analysis of the ways in which the five individuals explain, clarify, or enhance their own 
<span>contributions</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  Thus, while these five posters are highly visible and significant members of the <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> a <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that examines only their <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>risks a seriously distorted view not only of the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>as a whole, but also of the social role played by the highly active posters.</p>

<h3>Sample four: five short threads</h3>

<h4>Sample overview</h4>

<p>Unlike the threads used in Sample Two, 
none of these threads persist for more than thirteen posts, 
although all of them continue over a <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of several days.  
In our original formulation of the methods for this project, 
we had not anticipated using such a <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> assuming that analysing 
longer threads and more active participants in addition to the 
original set of fifty consecutive posts would provide a good 
overview of the activities of the newsgroup.  However, our 
examination of the other <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>led us to suspect that, while 
posts to the longer threads were often less than substantive and 
the posts by very active posters often tended to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>their own 
idiosyncratic interests, the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>work of the group might take 
place elsewhere.  Since we had <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that the majority of threads 
were, in fact, quite brief, it was decided that a fourth <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>should 
be <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>our suspicion.  As this analysis will demonstrate, 
the fourth <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>tends</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to corroborate this suspicion.</p>

<p>All of the five short threads in this <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>follow a common pattern.  
Each begins with a single post that describes a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and 
asks for assistance or for further information.  Most <span>subsequent</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
posts in each thread attempt to provide answers, although (in two cases) 
some discussion takes place debating the <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of those answers.  
Three of the threads reach a <span>conclusion</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that is satisfactory to 
all participants (i.e., the initial question is answered), while 
two of them simply come to an end without full <span>resolution</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  The 
final post of the shortest thread (of only three posts) gives 
some indication of the seriousness with which participants 
engage in their interactions:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>Between [the first] <span>response</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and mine, I hope 
we have answered all your questions fully.</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>By contrast, the longest thread, which unfolds over <span>seven</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>days 
through thirteen <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>posts (two of which are duplicates), 
ends with some <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of ambiguity in the answer.  While all of 
the posts <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>address the initial query, participants 
disagree about the <span>details</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the answer, and engage in some 
back-and-forth about those <span>details</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  However, even this thread 
ends with an acknowledgement that the answers put forth by all 
participants are of value in the overall goal of helping the initial 
poster find an answer; the final poster states his <span>disagreement</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>with 
earlier posts, but concludes by noting that his 'Knowledge ... is 
<span>limited</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> so [he] could be <span>wrong</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>.</p>

<p>Such dialogue is <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the short threads, even one in which all 
posters beyond the first make it clear that they think the initial 
question (about ways in which to 0estep an employer's security 
measures) <span>raises</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>ethical issues.  All of the posters to this thread 
note those ethical <span>concerns</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> but still attempt to provide serious 
answers while warning the original poster that he may find himself 
'up a creek' and without a job if he disregards their warnings.  
Even here, the full <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of all participants is on issues related 
to firewalls rather than personalities or reputations.</p>

<h4>Coherence</h4>

<p>The elements of coherence described in our analysis of the other <span>samples</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>pertain within the five short threads as well.  Here, as elsewhere, it is clear that strictly structural <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of posts, such as placement and extent of quotes, can either impede or enhance the communicative and informational <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the group, depending upon how closely the norms governing them are <span>followed</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h4>Reference</h4>

<p>The objects and activities to which the posts in these 
five brief threads refer, as in our other <span>samples</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> remain sharply 
on task.  Not surprisingly, because of the brevity of these threads, 
and because of the <span>degree</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to which they <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>on problem-solving 
and question-answering, the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of references in each thread 
remains narrow, and each thread is <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to a single <span>reference</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> 
though most of the threads explore several aspects of that <span>reference</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

<h4>Invention</h4>

<p>Each of the five threads reaches a <span>conclusion</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>through the creation of new information <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for the use of the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>as a whole.</p>  

<h4>Intention</h4>

<p>Again, because of the brevity of the five threads in this <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> issues of intention are quite straightforward.  
In one case, the <span>difficulties</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of assessing the intentions of another becomes an explicit <span>concern</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>for one poster, who writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>I'm not sure whether you're most <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
referring to *SSL* vs. VPN, and not SSH.</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>While it <span>ultimately</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>becomes clear that the initial poster was, 
in fact, referring to SSH rather than SSL, the potential for

<span>remainder</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the thread.  Relationships among the three technologies 
become the <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the discussion, with the result that the body of 
knowledge created by the end of the thread becomes much richer than the

intention becomes retrospective:  while the initial poster did not have 
all of the aspects of the ultimate discussion in mind when raising his 
question, the processes through which others in the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>interpret</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
the texts that precede theirs create not only their own understandings, 
but effectively recast and broaden the intentions with which 
the thread begins.</p>

<h4>Overall <span>characterization</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the community</h4>

<p>Like the first <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of fifty consecutive posts, this <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>paints a picture of a group that is atypical of Usenet as a whole.  The five threads of this <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>are consistent in their sharp <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>on issues related to firewall technologies.  Even those instances in which other issues are raised; the use and placement of quotations, for 
instance, or the <span>intended</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>meaning of an earlier post, are done in such a way that the priority remains firewalls; the group <span>represented</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>by these threads does not allow itself to be distracted by endless flame wars or other meta-conversations, as happened in the longer threads.</p>

<h4>Limitations of the sample</h4>

<p>Because of the brevity of the threads within this <span>sample</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> it does not give a clear picture of the full <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that take place within the newsgroup.  For example, only two of the most active posters appear within these five threads.  Further, the <span>sample</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>makes it appear that some posters are more active within the newsgroup than they are <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of these five threads.  For example, in one thread a single participant makes three posts compared to one by another participant.  Further examination reveals that the active poster in this thread is only moderately active elsewhere in the group, while the other poster is (while not one of the most active) very active in 
<span>discussions</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the specific technologies with which he is most <span>familiar</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> and could be con0ered a core member of the <span>community</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>sampling</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of only brief threads, while it does <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the level of on-task <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that they contain, is thus <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in both scope and <span>representation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of individual participants.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>This study is an initial attempt to illustrate <em>how language use both reflects and influences culture in a virtual community</em> using an approach based in cultural hermeneutics and textual analysis.  The four elements of our conceptual model: <em>coherence, <span>reference</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>invention</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> and intention</em>, provide a set of entry points for examining the texts exchanged by a virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>as they go about their daily <span>business</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of text-based social <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and knowledge creation.  Using a specific <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> a Usenet newsgroup devoted to firewall technologies, for our analysis, this pilot study aimed  to <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the usefulness and applicability of the four concepts for  understanding virtual communities.  Four <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>samples were  used to <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>our discussion and to <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>the variability of  participants' views of virtual communities that make up Usenet;  this approach, in essence, has allowed us to conduct a multi-faceted case study of a specific <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in addition to <span>testing</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>our concepts in practice.</p>

<h3>Contributions of the study</h3>

<p>While the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of a case study&mdash;even one as multi-faceted as this&mdash;cannot <span>easily</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>be generalized to other situations, the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of this study <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>a number of important conclusions that should be applicable to other communities. </p> 

<p>First, while it has often been <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that information exchange and socializing are intertwined in virtual 
communities (see, for example, <a href="#Burnett1">Burnett, 2000</a>), the four concepts allow a robust understanding of the relationship between the two.  By focusing on the formal <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
of a <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>s texts, the concept of <em>coherence</em> allows us a 
greater understanding of the ways in which such <span>characteristics</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
are not only socially derived, but also of the ways in which they 
enter <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>into the discourse of a <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and can be 
consciously used by the <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to enhance efforts to create 
a community-based body of knowledge.  For example, the reminder 
made by one of the five most prolific posters to use <span>accurate</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
and appropriate subject headers reflects the <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>s awareness 
that formal textual elements of their posts have an impact on the 
ways in which they can be interpreted by other <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>members. 
While other communities may integrate their awareness of textual 
elements in their own idiosyncratic ways, we would <span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that 
such awareness is, most likely, a common <span>feature</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of virtual communities.</p>

<p>Second, the concept of <em>invention</em> makes explicit the ways 
in which communities can use texts to 'speak the past' by 
using existing texts in a social <span>setting</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to help define the 
current state of knowledge within the content realm chosen by the 
<span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>as its own.  Conversely, it also makes clear the ways in 
which communities, through social <span>interaction</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> both adapt existing 
knowledge to their own <span>purposes</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> making it relevant within their 
own specific context, and 'speak the present' by producing new 
knowledge that meets their own specific needs.  Our study, 
focusing on one <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>s activities over a <span>period</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of six weeks, 
illustrates that <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>s unique approach to the <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
of <span>invention</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>  Again, while other communities will be quite 
different in the specifics of their knowledge <span>invention</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> we 
<span>suggest</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that the concept has the potential to allow a new and 
more robust understanding of socially-based knowledge 
structures in virtual communities.</p>

<p>Finally, a <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>on the multiple dimensions of texts provides a 
new understanding of the full importance of texts within 
virtual communities.  Our analysis suggests that texts are 
not merely vehicles for communication, not, that is, simply 
conduits for the unambiguous transfer of information from one 
<span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to another, but rather serve multiple <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>simultaneously.  
While they do transfer information, they also provide that 
information within a social context, and create an expanding 
archive of socially-contextualized information well beyond the 
capabilities of any individual participant.  In turn, this allows 
groups to negotiate reputations, socialize, and define the <span>limits</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
of their knowledge.</p>

<h3>Limitations of the study</h3>

<p>As noted above, this study allowed us to uncover an important limitation of the conceptual model.  
Our analysis of the longest threads suggested that knowledge creation was a <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>result of neither frequency of posting nor the <span>length</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of a given interaction; indeed, the relationship 
between the two may be negative: as threads in the virtual <span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>
became longer, they tended to diverge from the work of the <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> 
becoming more and more enmeshed in flames and personal/professional 
antagonisms.  While the conceptual model allowed us a robust 
understanding of the <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>future</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span><span>applications</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of the model 
will need to integrate this understanding, and find a way to 
account for this discrepancy.</p>

<p>Another limitation is that this pilot study involved a virtual 
<span>community</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that relied totally on a single type of electronic 
communication for its interchanges&mdash;postings to a Usenet newsgroup.  
Many virtual work groups and communities rely on multiple media, 
such as telephone and e-mail, and sometimes even face-to-face 
communication for their exchanges.  It remains to be seen whether 
our approach provides <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>robustness for understanding 
culture in situations where multiple communication channels are used.</p>

<h3>Future directions</h3>

<p>Using knowledge gleaned from our pilot study, 
we will revise our model and use our ideas to examine less 
amorphous online settings such as organizationally-based 
virtual environments.  We anticipate that the current study 
will lead to an on-going series of such studies, which will 
result in a rich understanding of the textual <span>dynamics</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of online 
communities as well as of the role of text in creating information 
stores in those communities.  Thus, our work has important implications 
for developers of online communities and for organizations that use 
online environments to conduct work.  We anticipate that our work 
will result in a series of recommendations for the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and 
management of online work environments that can optimize the 
effectiveness and usability of those environments while minimizing 
the <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of distractions the current study <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>in the longer threads.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This study is an initial attempt to illustrate <em>how language 
use both reflects and influences culture in a virtual community</em> 
using an approach based in cultural hermeneutics and textual 
analysis.  Our pilot study analysed <span>contributions</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to a Usenet 
newsgroup on firewall technology by using elements in our conceptual 
model to examine the <span>community</span>' <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>s texts as it engaged in social 
<span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>and knowledge creation. </p> 

<p>While it is generally <span>accepted</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>that information exchange 
and socializing are intertwined in virtual communities, 
our model allows a robust understanding of the relationship 
between the two.  Invention makes explicit the ways communities 
use texts to 'speak the past' in social settings to define the 
current state of knowledge.  Conversely, communities adapt 
existing knowledge through social <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>to make it relevant, 
and 'speak the present' by producing new knowledge to meet their 
specific needs.  Focusing on multiple dimensions of texts provides 
a new understanding of their full importance within virtual 
communities.  Texts serve multiple <span>purposes</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>simultaneously and 
are not merely vehicles for communication.  Concurrently with the 
transfer of information, texts also provide this knowledge within 
a social context, and create an expanding archive of socially-contextualized 
information well beyond the capabilities of any individual 
participant.  This allows groups to negotiate reputations, 
socialize, and define the <span>limits</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span>of their knowledge.  This 
study demonstrates that our conceptual model can provide the 
foundation for a richer understanding of culture in virtual 
environments that rely on text-based communication for their <span>interaction</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:114px 38px 114px 38px;position:relative;">.</span></p>

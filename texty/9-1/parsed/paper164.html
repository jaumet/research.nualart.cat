<h2>Introduction</h2> 

<p>The 1999 thorough reform of Polish health care system revealed large deficiencies of data and research evidence and a <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of organized <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for information provision. Professionals who seemed to need effective information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were mostly policymakers and health care managers. So, a study was conducted to identify the  information needs and behaviour of this category of users. The study's <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>goal was to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>preliminary data about current information needs, preferences and the limitations of health care managers as information users. The <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>goal was to identify significant environmental factors influencing their information behaviour.</p>  

<p>Wilson's (<a href="#wil96">1996</a>) global model of information behaviour was used as a conceptual <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for the study. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>national, mailed <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was conducted, to generate some representative <span>numerical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>data. The target population included hospital chief executives, medical directors, head nurses, and directors of the institutions responsible for planning and purchasing (directors of local government health departments and directors of sickness funds). The <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>questionnaire was developed on the basis of the recorded <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>groups interviews and structured interviews with individuals. The development of the questions for both (focus groups and interviews) was guided by the concepts included in Wilson's model. The questionnaire was than pilot-tested on managers who were participants of a postgraduate managerial course at the Institute of Public Health of Jagiellonian University. The understanding was <span>checked</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and changes were made to wording and precision of the questions, to improve the reliability of the <span>instrument</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Confidence in the <span>findings</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>was validated, as the pilot results were consistent with those obtained during the interviews and <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>groups. In order to estimate a return rate a pilot mailing of the questionnaire was undertaken. The questionnaire, <span>accompanied</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by a supporting <span>letter</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and a pre-paid return envelope, was mailed in March 2000 to the appropriate number of managers of listed categories, <span>drawn</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>systematically from the official <span>list</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Answers were coded and entered into a database <span>designed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>specifically for the questionnaire. The internal consistency of entered data were <span>checked</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and <span>statistical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>analysis was done using <span>software</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>Statistica 5.0.</p> 

<p>The <span>survey</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>data were supplemented with information collected during <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>group <span>discussions</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> structured interviews and through analysis of relevant policy and legal <span>documents</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> The interviews were conducted with Ministry of Health officials to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>information about government information policy.

This paper presents a '0e-result' of the study, the revision of Wilson's model. The <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>requirements of the research revealed some conceptual <span>difficulties</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> which the model imposes on the researchers.  Also, the model turned out not to be general enough to encompass the predominant information behaviour of the users under <span>investigation</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Therefore, although it was not the assumed aim of the study, a revision of the model was undertaken in the light of the research <span>findings</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> This paper presents this undertaking.</p> 

<h2>Models of information behaviour</h2> 

<p>The concepts founding Wilson's original model were presented in <a href="#wil81">1981</a>, and a <span>variation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of that model was presented in <a href="#wil99">1999</a>. The model is one of several employed in research concerned with information use and users (see <a href="#cas02">Case, 2002</a>). These models present in a simplified way the relationships among theoretical propositions and processes connected with identification and satisfying <span>one's</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>information needs. The existing models can be grouped according to the level of described processes (for example, level of cognition, level of social behaviour) or according to how complete a picture of behaviour they present (that is, whether they refer to a particular stage of information <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or present a full <span>sequence</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of related <span>mental</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and physical activities). The content of the models <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the research <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>assumed by their authors, mainly: <span>cognitive</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> social, socio-cognitive or organizational <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#all96">Allen, 1996</a>). Among <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>models, Dervin's (<a href="#der83">1983</a>) 'sense-making' model  is recognized, by many researchers,  as a landmark in information user research, because it turns <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>cause of all users' activities, that is, <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>discomfort. Among <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>models are also  Ingwersen's model (<a href="#ing84">1984</a>), which shows the relations among information and <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>processes, or Pr&#243;chnicka's model (<a href="#prs91">1991</a>) presenting dependence of behaviour upon the type of intellect.</p> 

<p>Researchers who apply the social <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>see information users first of all as the members of a particular <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> social category or group. They recognize the social placement or a professional role as the most important determinants of users' information behaviour. For example, the model developed by Katzer and Fletcher (<a href="#kat92">1992</a>) shows specific information behaviour of managers. The relationship between behaviour and social <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is also underlined in Wersig <em>et al.'s</em> (<a href="#wer82">1982</a>) or Wo&#378;niak's (<a href="#woz92">1992</a>) models. In organizational <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>most important determinants of information behaviour are connected with the type of organization or system in which users work, and formal and informal flows of information in organization microenvironment. The models of communication in organization show that the place a user occupies in organization structure is <span>crucial</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for how well he or she is informed  (<a href="#sob97">Sobkowiak, 1997</a>). Ingwersen's model (<a href="#ing95">1995</a>) suggests even that communication in organizations deserves to be a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>subject of research on information users.  Finally, the socio-cognitive <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>underlines the influence of the social <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on a <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>s knowledge. Researchers who take such <span>perspective</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that information behaviour <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the processes of social learning (a concept <span>introduced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in Wilson's model).</p> 

<p>Information behaviour models present a certain section or a full <span>sequence</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of activities, which lead to obtaining information. Some of them concentrate on the phase when information need arises, which is called 'problem recognition', 'problem identification' or 'verbalization'.  Such models, as in Dervin's sense-making model (<a href="#der83">1983</a>) or Wilson's problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>model (<a href="#wil99">1999</a>) <span>abstract</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the intellectual process of problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>from the context, and <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on it. Others, such as Wersig and Windel (<a href="#wer85">1985</a>) or Katzer and Fletcher (<a href="#kat92">1992</a>) models present problem <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as environmentally conditioned. Some models give a static picture of the user (for example, <a href="#wer82">
Wersig <em>et al.</em>, 1982</a>;  <a href="#ing95">Ingwersen, 1995</a> or <a href="#prs91">
Pr&#243;chnicka, 1991</a>), others show the user in <span>action</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> progressing from problem definition, through information seeking, <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with certain information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the stage of information processing and use. Examples of the latter are the models of Wilson  (<a href="#wil81">1981</a>, <a href="#wil96">1996</a>, <a href="#wil99">1999</a>),  Wo&#378;niak (<a href="#woz89">1989</a>), Katzer and Fletcher (<a href="#kat92">
1992</a>), or, restricted to the stage of information <span>search</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> those of <span>Ellis</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(<a href="#ell89">1989</a>) or Kuhlthau (<a href="#kuh91">1991</a>). These models stress the dynamic and cyclic character of information behaviour. </p>

<p>The models selectively <span>referred</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to are complementary to one another, or put in light various stages of the process.  The <span>sequence</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information behaviour is relatively most complete (from need identification to information use) in  Wilson's macro-model (<a href="#wil96">1996</a>). This model presents also full <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of influencing factors and mechanisms: <span>cognitive</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> social and environmental, and it integrates most of mentioned earlier research perspectives. That is why this model was chosen as a general <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for, the described briefly in the <span>introduction</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> preliminary <span>investigation</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>into information behaviour of managers in health care system, conducted in Poland. As it was said earlier, during the study progress and in the light of research results Wilson's model occurred to have some shortcomings and not to encompass the <span>major</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>behaviour of a category of users under <span>investigation</span>. <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 

<h2>Wilson's general model of information behaviour</h2> 

<p>Wilson's revised model of 1996 is presented in <span>Figure</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>1. It pictures the cycle of information activities, from the <span>rise</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information need to the phase when information is being used. It includes various intervening variables, which have a significant influence on information behaviour, and <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>which activate it.</p>

<h3>The context</h3> 

<p>Wilson assumes two propositions. First, that information needs are <span>secondary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>needs, caused by <span>primary</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>needs, which in accordance with <span>definitions</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in <span>psychology</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>can be defined as physiological, <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or affective.  <span>Cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>needs <span>rise</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>as an attempt to find sense and order in the world, and are the realization of a need to explain and make sense out of phenomena, but also can be simulated by common, non-utilitarian curiosity. The <span>rise</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of a particular need is <span>influenced</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>by the context, which can be the <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>him or herself, or the role the <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>plays in work and life, or the environments (social, political, economical, technological, etc.).  The elements of the context intertwine; sometimes they <span>condition</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>each other, which was underlined in the earlier version of Wilson's model (1981).</p>

Finally, the <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> within which life and work of information user takes place encompasses social <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> its organizational structure, including the information services and <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> economic <span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> technology, culture, tradition, etc.  The <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>conditions the occurrence of certain needs; for example, they differ in periods of political and economic changes from the needs present in a time of <span>stability</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>  In analysing the users' <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>we can take into con0eration the  macro-environment (socio-political and economic system of a country or industry sector), mezzo <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(that is, regional <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> local <span>community</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> a particular city) or the micro-environment of a single organization. Formal and informal information sources and channels function on all levels. Their characteristic <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>may influence (stimulate or hinder) information needs and determine behaviour. These contextual factors influence not only the occurrence, and determine the kind of a need, but they also affect the <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information barriers, and the ways in which a need is satisfied. Factors conditioning information behaviour can be supportive or preventive.  To <span>indicate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>this twofold impact, Wilson uses a <span>term</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>'intervening variables', <span>instead</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of 'barriers', which was used in his 1981 model.</p> 

<h3>Intervening variables</h3> 

<p>Wilson, drawing upon research from various fields (psychology, sociology, decision-making, etc.), points out numerous significant determinants of information behaviour. Like the factors influencing the occurrence of information need, they can be of a personal, role-related or of environmental nature. </p>

<p>Among the <span>psychological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>variables are outlook on life and system of <span>values</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> political orientation, knowledge, <span>style</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of learning, emotional variables, attitude towards innovation, stereotypes, preferences, prejudices, self-perception (self-evaluation of knowledge and skills), interests, and knowledge of the subject, task, information or <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>system. Demographic variables include sex, age, social and economic <span>status</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>education</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and job experience, etc. In his model Wilson separates <span>psychological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and demographic variables.</p> 

<p>The role a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>plays (usually there are several, including professional role) situates an individual in a particular place in a social system and in an organization. It means also a defined place in formal and informal communication networks. This creates certain opportunities and barriers in access to information. Role-related or interpersonal variables encompass job character, requirements, regulations and limitations; standards and patterns of behaviour <span>established</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(in a particular professional category); the place a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>occupies in organization or whole system of organizations; a <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>hierarchy of values; and level of responsibility. Environmental variables, which can be analysed on a country, local or organizational levels, include legislation, economical <span>situation</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> level of stabilization, organizational structure of a sector (dependency and competencies), information culture (traditional vs. innovative; individual vs. collective; level of acceptance of inequalities in access to information), IT technology, localization of information sources, type of organization, organizational culture. Wilson separates from environmental factors <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>characteristics</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> such as currency of information, appropriateness, and reliability.</p>  

<p>The author of the model notes that it is the value of an intervening variable that determines whether it supports or hinders information behaviour. For example, a low level of knowledge about existing information resources is a barrier, whereas a high level supports information behaviour.</p> 

<h3>The <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that activate information behaviour.</h3> 

<p>Between what he calls 'person-in-context' and the decision to seek information, Wilson inserts a concept of activating <span>mechanism</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> He notes, rightly, that not every need gives an incentive to undertake activities leading to seeking information. To find out what stimulates and motivates information seeking Wilson looks for an answer mainly in <span>psychology</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> but points out the necessity to draw also from other sciences.  One of the activating <span>mechanisms</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> according to the author, can be explained by a stress/coping theory. According to this theory, Wilson suggests, not all information needs make a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>seek information.  For example, an individual does not engage in seeking activities if he or she is convinced that the possessed knowledge is <span>sufficient</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to understand the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and make a decision.  If s/he lacks such conviction, the stress connected with danger of making a mistake, trespassing social or legal norms, financial responsibility or not answering expectations of other people, <span>occurs</span>. <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>  The bigger the stress the bigger is the motivation to look for information, up to a certain point where the stress paralyses such activities.  Another activating factor is a necessity to cope with a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>a problem. Wanting a reward can induce this feeling of necessity, even if the reward means only the comfort coming from eliminating the feeling of uncertainty.  The risk/reward theory explains why, in some situations, people seek information in some not, and why certain information sources are more <span>frequently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>used then other.  Generally <span>speaking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>it <span>depends</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on the amount and nature of perceived risk resulting from giving up information seeking. It can be risk of unnecessary expenditure, time loss, etc. An important stimulator of information behaviour is also the <span>perception</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of self-efficacy, explained in depth by social learning theory. The expectation of efficacy is the <span>estimation</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>whether a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>can successfully execute the behaviour. It affects <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>decisions to undertake necessary activities, and determines whether a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>even try to cope with the <span>situation</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></p> 

<h3>Phase of acquiring of information.</h3> 

<p>Among the <span>modes</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of obtaining information Wilson differentiates passive <span>attention</span>, <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> passive <span>search</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> active <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and ongoing <span>search</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> First <span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>means passive absorption of information from the <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> for example, when the TV or radio is on, without <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>s intention to seek information. It is not purposeful information behaviour, although it is an important way of assimilating information. The second <span>mode</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>applies to those occasions when a particular type of behaviour results in <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information that happens to be relevant to the individual. The <span>third</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> active <span>search</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> takes place when a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>actively seeks out information. The fourth, an ongoing <span>search</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> means continuing <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>carried out to update or expand area of information.</p> 

<h3>Phase of information processing and use</h3> 

<p>Information obtained by a user is then processed, becomes an item of <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>s knowledge, and is used, <span>directly</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or indirectly, to influence the <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and, as a consequence, create new information needs.    <span>Mental</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and physical information activities form a cyclic process, in which individual elements of the context determine a <span>person</span>' <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>s behaviour at all stages, and where information obtained becomes a new element in a dynamic system.</p> 

<h2>Critical remarks</h2> 

<p>The following critical remarks refer to the content and graphical <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of Wilson's revised model of information behaviour. They are the result of conceptual analysis, stimulated by the <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>need to categorize  factors and <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>that <span>ought</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to be taken into con0eration while investigating the information behaviour of a specific category of users (in this case, managers). It has to be stressed that, in accordance with how its author sees it, the model served as 'a <span>framework</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for thinking about the problem', and a 'a <span>map</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the area' (<a href="#wil99">Wilson, 1999</a>). The model was used as such, and the suggested relationships among theoretical propositions were not tested. The <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>research task, the development of a set of <span>concrete</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>questions to be asked and necessity to choose important data regarding users <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> induced, however, a deep analysis of a model. Such a <span>practical</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>application of a theoretical model to a specific research need seems to be a next step towards the development of a model of relationships, and a <span>test</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of its adherence to reality. During the research process it occurred that generally Wilson's model gives a good frame for thinking about the process of information acquiring, but some improvements can be made to make it more clear and consistent. The <span>controversial</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>issues are as follows:</p> 

<ul>
<li>The author in his comments on the model, clearly differentiates the phase of the occurrence of information need from the phase when a decision to seek information is undertaken. The diagram does not <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>this partition, although it seems to be important, since as it was said, not every need leads to information seeking, and the decision has to be induced by a certain stimulus, different from the need itself.</li> 

<li>Wilson graphically separates 'the context' from the intervening variables, which influence information behaviour. Is there such necessity? These variables, after all, form the context of information behaviour. They are of different nature: environmental (external from the person), role-related (they cross the border, are external by being induced by social <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> but are also interiorised by a person) and personal (inseparable from the <span>person</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> it can be said that characteristic <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>him/her-self are also the context of information need). It is a matter of definition, of course, whether, by context, only the external variables or also the role-related and strictly personal variables are to be <span>understood</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span></li> 

<li>Wilson separates <span>psychological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and demographic variables, while they can be put in one category of personal variables (inseparable from the person), unless we make the diagram more <span>detailed</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> If we do, as proposed here, several sub-categories of personal variables can be made, that is, physiological, affective, <span>cognitive</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> demographic, etc.</li> 

<li>The <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are treated as a <span>separate</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>class of variables, while the <span>source</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>is an element of information <span>environment</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(context), so they can be included in a general class of environmental variables (again a model can be more <span>detailed</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> and if, all possible <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of environmental variables are to be included).</li> 

<li>The graphical <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the model also creates some reservations. It suggests that intervening variables influence the user only at the stage of information <span>acquisition</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> while the influence of all <span>kinds</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of variables (personal, role-related, and environmental) can be thought of, also, at the stages of need occurrence, decision-making, processing and use.</li> 

<li>The same applies to the activating <span>mechanisms</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> They can be found not only when a decision to seek information is being undertaken, but also at all other stages of information <span>acquisition</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> Similarly to the <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>when a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>can give up efforts to seek information, he or she cannot process or use it, if certain stimuli or capabilities are not in place. With <span>probability</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> it can be said that the <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>explained by the theories called in by Wilson (stress and coping, risk and reward, self efficacy), and possibly others, can be applied at all stages of the information <span>acquisition</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>process.</li> 

<li>It would be better to name particular activating mechanisms: 'stress', 'perception of risk', 'hope for reward', 'perceived level of self-efficacy', rather than 'theory of' each of these.</li> 

<li>Wilson's diagram suggests causative relation (arrows) between activating <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and intervening variables, what can be misleading since these <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>are the general <span>psychological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or sociological phenomena, not an independent element of the context.</li> 

<li>Application of Wilson's model is <span>limited</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to a <span>situation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in which a user seeks information personally. Admittedly in his publication in 1981, the author drew <span>attention</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to other <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of obtaining information, and called them 'information-seeking paths', but this is not reflected in the 1996 model. These paths are: a) seeking information by a user independent of any information system. <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>user seeks information in his/her immediate <span>environment</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> uses his/her own knowledge, a handy <span>collection</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of sources and an informal <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of advisers; b)  a mediator or an information system's technology is involved; c) a mediator seeks information; and d) a sophisticated technology does the <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>on behalf of either the user or the mediator.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Further remarks concerning the model are the consequence of the results of the research into information behaviour of managers in health care system. Here are some relevant conclusions of the research.</p> 

<ul>
<li>Managers, although they are a category of professionals, who intensively use information, generally they are not the independent users of information services. The results of a conducted <span>survey</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>focus</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>groups and interviews demonstrated that, in accordance with earlier studies (for numerous references see <a href="#kat92">Katzer and Fletcher, 1992</a>), work overload, <span>lack</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of time, diversity of tasks and fragmentation of the working <span>day</span>, <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> are the characteristic <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of managers' jobs. These <span>features</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>mean that managers, especially top-level managers, do not have time to seek information personally, methodically and on a continuous basis. They basically do not <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>information databases, do not use information centres, libraries, and Internet to look for professional information.</li> 

<li>Managers <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>job-related information from various intermediaries. Turning to intermediaries (managers of a lower level, information officers, co-workers, etc.) is the most frequent and <span>typical</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>information behaviour of managers, while the personal use of information services (information centres, archives, libraries) or <span>direct</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>interaction with <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>(databases, Internet) is marginal and rare behaviour. An intermediary is the most important element in a managers' information activity. Through formal and informal contacts with intermediaries managers get information necessary to <span>solve</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>problems and make decisions. Formal contacts are mainly the contacts with their subordinates (deputes, division managers, persons responsible for certain areas of operation, information specialists), but also with the superiors, consultants etc. Informal contacts mean, first of all, contacts with the <span>network</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of fellow professionals and peer group within an organization or the whole sector (managers, doctors, nurses, colleagues from <span>school</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and trainings). These intermediaries not only <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for information for managers, but may also process and evaluate it. The completeness and <span>quality</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>then upon the intermediaries' individual competencies, knowledge and skills. The higher the level of managerial position the longer is the <span>chain</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of intermediaries. It can be assumed that a decision to seek help from intermediaries <span>requires</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>certain motivation, which do not allow the manager to rely upon what he or she knows, or what is available at hand. Setting in motion a strategy of obtaining information is activated by factors such as a high level of uncertainty, the importance of a problem, perceived high risk, etc (Wilson's activating mechanisms).</li> 
</ul>

<p>The results of the research into managers' information behaviour showed that Wilson's 1996 model is not <span>suitable</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to describe this numerous category of information users, because it applies only to those who personally seek information, and this is not the predominant behaviour of managers. Since, most <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the managers are not the only group, which uses mediation of other people to such a big extent, it can be said that the model does not <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the important information behaviour of a large groups of information users.</p> 

<h2>A new information behaviour model based on Wilson's theoretical propositions</h2> 

<p>In the context of these comments, an attempt was made to modify the model so, in its content as well as graphically, it illustrates stages of information behaviour, and relationships, that can be <span>observed</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in a process, in such a way that it can be applied to a broader, <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of users. All components of Wilson's model were preserved, even if some compressed into one type (e.g., demographic variables included in a category of personal variables). The new model remains general, but all its general concepts can be unfolded when necessary, to reveal in detail what are, in example, the environmental variables, what activating <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>can work, etc. Further research and theoretical work hopefully will fill in missing variables. The content of certain general categories of variables also should be discussed.</p> 
     
<p>In a new model (Figure 2) the totality of information behaviour is submerged in a context, which consists of Wilson's intervening variables (personal, role-related, and environmental).  Such <span>presentation</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of the relationship stresses the fact that these factors are always present and they influence the process at all its stages. The new model indicates also that the activating <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>can <span>occur</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>at each link of the <span>chain</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of behaviour leading to acquiring and using information. The <span>psychological</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>theories <span>explaining</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>activating <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>were removed from the diagram not to negate or undermine their importance, but because they are part of the knowledge base behind the used concepts. The author thinks that it would be better to construct a 'shadow' set of <span>explanatory</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>theories standing behind respective concepts, rather than introduce them as the components of the information behaviour cycle. 
  
<p>In the new model, a phase of the need occurrence is separated from a phase of making a decision to seek information, which follows Wilson's comments and suggests that also at this stage the activating <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>can play a significant role. The phases of information seeking, selection/processing and information application also are separated, and the <span>justification</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of this separation is the same: the importance of activating <span>mechanisms</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>in stopping or impelling the process. The cycle-like, dynamic character of the process, reflecting the necessary feedback loop, is preserved.</p>

<div align="center">Figure 2: <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>new model of information behaviour</div>

<p>The model shows two basic <span>strategies</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information seeking:<p></p> 

<ol>
<li>a user seeks information personally, or</li> 
<li>a user uses the help or services of other people.</li>
</ol> 

<p>The <span>figure</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>indicates that a user can choose one, the other, or both of the <span>strategies</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>fully independent user applies his own knowledge, available sources and interacts with <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span><span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and information services (uses databases, catalogues, archives, search-engines etc.).  Such a rare user also selects and processes the <span>acquired</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>information personally.  Probably much more often people use also various intermediaries and their services (information specialists, subordinates, co-workers), and utilize the effects of their information seeking and processing (we might call this <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>a semi-independent user). <span>A+</span>  <span class="compus" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>user can also almost entirely <span>depend</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>upon intermediaries, and he or she acts <span>independently</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>only at the stage of <span>mental</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>processing of information. It was said 'almost' because economics of information behaviour <span>probably</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>makes an individual use sources that are at hand and appropriate without using a mediator.  But <span>essentially</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>it is an intermediary who engages in systematic information activities: asking, seeking and searching, for this kind of user.</p> 

<p>In the light of this research, it can be said that managers <span>belong</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the last category. They predominantly turn to the various intermediaries to <span>obtain</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>necessary data and evidence. This does not exclude the marginal use of other <span>strategies</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> those applied by independent or semi-independent users, but shows the predominant behaviour. Identification of a predominant behaviour is very important for the <span>design</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and organization of information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>for a particular category of users, and seems to be the first indispensable step of any research conducted into users' behaviour and needs. Such identification allows defining the <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>and type of problems, which are to be taken into con0eration while outlining the area of necessary research, or designing certain information services. For instance, in <span>regard</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>to the categories of persons who are not the end-users of information <span>systems</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>some investigations, such as learning about their <span>search</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>skills, or about specific <span>cognitive</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>processes <span>taking</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>place in their <span>interaction</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>with computerized <span>systems</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> are not so important. Much more important would be <span>finding</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>out about their social <span>interactions</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>or communication skills.</p> 

<p>The proposed new model applies to a wider <span>range</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of information users. The author hopes also, that it presents concept of information behaviour and its possible conditioning factors in more clear way. It is obvious though that the model is still far from perfection and completeness. It does not present all aspects of information behaviour, e.g., it does not <span>reflect</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the fact that from the birth of a need (problematic situation) through the following stages of decision-making and information <span>acquisition</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> the process is not separated from other needs, and often several sequences of information seeking are performed simultaneously using various <span>strategies</span>. <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> The sequences intertwine and support each other, and every one is full of crossroads and loops until they find final closure in <span>solving</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the problem or making a decision. To some extent the cycle-like form of a model suggests this, but not <span>strongly</span>  <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>enough. It can be also argued that the model is not really <span>universal</span>, <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> since it does not include incidental information seeking or information encountering (Wilson's passive attention), which definitely are ways of information <span>acquisition</span>. <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> But is this the information behaviour? If we accept Wilson's definition (1999) saying that information behaviour consists of, "activities a <span>person</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>may engage in when identifying his or her own needs for information, searching for such information and using or transferring information", <span>accidental</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>information intake can not be treated as the result of any purposeful activities. Though, if we <span>assume</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the information provider's point of view, this way of reception of information, although passive, is very important, sometimes <span>crucial</span>, <span class="exper" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span> for information dissemination. Therefore, perhaps the passive or <span>accidental</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>information intake should be incorporated into the model, but placed somewhere <span>out0e</span>  <span class="quali" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>the <span>circle</span>  <span class="quanti" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>of purposeful information behaviour? How, and if, remains an open task for research.  The model proposed here hopefully stimulates discussion and further theoretical and <span>empirical</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>studies, with the aim to construct the a comprehensive and <span>universal</span>  <span class="conce" style="width:1px;border-width:87px 29px 87px 29px;position:relative;">.</span>model of information behaviour . </p>
